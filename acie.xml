         <title>Boosting Oxygen Reduction via Integrated Construction and Synergistic Catalysis of Porous Platinum Alloy and Defective Graphitic Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrated fabrication through the strong interaction between catalyst and carrier is crucial to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis for fuel cells. We report herein a porous Pt&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon via integration engineering, where a synergistic catalysis between ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C results in the optimized reaction pathway and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The hybrid catalyst PtCuCo@Co&#8208;N&#8208;C delivers a mass activity of 1.14 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960 mW cm&#8208;2 in the full&#8208;cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12 A mgPt&#8208;1 and 780 mW cm&#8208;2). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti&#8208;corrosion capabilities and improving ORR performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Solvatochromic Fluorescent Probe Reveals Polarity Heterogeneity upon Protein Aggregation in Cells.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physicochemical details at the interphase of protein aggregation have been less explored especially in live cells. Herein, we reported a crystallization induced emission fluorophore to quantitatively interrogate the polarity of aggregated proteins. This solvatochromic probe, namely &#8220;AggRetina&#8221; probe, inherently binds to aggregated proteins and exhibits both polarity&#8208;dependent fluorescence emission wavelength shift and viscosity&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity increase. Regulation of its polarity sensitivity was achieved by extending the conjugation length. Empowered by this probe, we observed that different proteins bear diverse polarity upon aggregation, leading to different resistance to proteolysis. We further showed that polarity primarily decreases during protein misfolding but viscosity mainly increases upon the formation of insoluble aggregates.&#160; Finally, we quantified the polarity of aggregated protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest in live cells via HaloTag bioorthogonal labeling, revealing polarity heterogeneity within cellular aggregates. This work highlights the enriched micro&#8208;environment details inside misfolded and aggregated proteins that may correlate to their bio&#8208;chemical properties and pathogenicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Bilayer 2D Supramolecular Organic Framework in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate control of the layer number of orderly stacked 2D polymers has been an unsettled challenge in self&#8208;assembly. Herein we describe the fabrication of a bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework from a monolayer 2D supramolecular organic framework in water by utilizing the multivalent coordination of a rod&#8208;like bipyridine ligands to zinc porphyrin subunits of the monolayer network. The monolayer supramolecular framework is prepared from the co&#8208;assembly of an octacationic zinc porphyrin monomer and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in water through CB[8]&#8208;encapsulation&#8208;promoted dimerization of 4&#8208;phenylpyridiunium subunits that the zinc porphyrin monomer bear. The bilayer 2D supramolecular organic framework exhibits structural regularity in both solution and the solid state, which is characterized by synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopic techniques. Atomic force microscopic imaging confirms that the bilayer character of the 2D supramolecular organic framework can be realized selectively on the micrometer scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Hydroamination of Alkenes with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and general radical hydroamination of alkenes using Co(salen) as catalyst, N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) and its analogues as both nitrogen source and oxidant was successfully disclosed. A variety of alkenes, including aliphatic alkenes, styrenes, &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, amides, acids, as well as enones, were all compatible to provide desired amination products. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction underwent a metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with alkene, followed by a pivotal catalyst controlled SN2&#8208;like pathway between in situ generated organocobalt(IV) species and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles. Moreover, by virtue of modified chiral cobalt(II)&#8208;salen catalyst, an unprecedented asymmetric version was also achieved with good to excellent level of enantiocontrol. This novel asymmetric radical C&#8722;N bond construction opens a new door for the challenging asymmetric radical hydrofunctionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>1,6&#8208;Anthrazoline&#8208;linked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles and Two&#8208;dimensional Polymer via Friedl&#228;nder Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodology. Herein, we report the preparation of a 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline (AZ)&#8208;linked crystalline 2D polymer  AZP  via acid mediated Friedl&#228;nder synthesis. The feasibility was examined first by two model reactions, followed by synthesis of three AZ&#8208;based macrocycles  MCn  (n=5&#8208;7), in which hexagonal  MC6  was isolated as the major product. The favorable macrocycle formation could be largely attributed to the dynamic feature of Friedl&#228;nder synthesis, which involves both imine condensation and aldol condensation. The structure and crystallinity of  AZP  were confirmed by experiments and simulation. The skeletons of the macrocycles and polymer consist of all&#8208;sp2  hybridized C/N atoms and are thus &#960;&#8208;conjugated and electro&#8208;active. Our studies provide a rational way to access kinetically stable 2D crystalline polymers by combination of different dynamic covalent chemistries.</dc:description>

         <title>SmCo5 with a reconstructed oxyhydroxide surface for spin selective water oxidation under elevated temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of electrolytic hydrogen production is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Surface reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with spin pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin&#8208;dependent OER kinetics. However, in real&#8208;life applications electrolyzers are operated under elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this work, we prepared surface reconstructed SmCo  5  /CoO  x  H  y  , which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that leads to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic water electrolyzers&#8217; practical operation conditions. It is found that the OER activity enhancement of magnetized SmCo  5  /CoO  x  H  y  catalyst can be preserved up to 60 &#186;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Homoleptic Alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15 Nanocluster with Atomic Precision: Structural&#160;Analysis and Electrocatalytic Performance toward CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise Ag nanoclusters provide an ideal platform to&#160;correlate the structure and electrocatalytic performance at the atomic level.&#160;Herein, we report the fabrication of homoleptic alkynyl&#8208;protected Ag15(C&#8801;CtBu)12+ (abbreviated as Ag15) nanocluster and its electrocatalytic properties&#160;toward CO2 reduction reaction. Crystal structure analysis reveals that, Ag15
possesses a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure with an Ag@Ag8@Ag6&#160;metal core configuration. Interestingly, we found that, Ag15 can adsorb CO2&#160;in air and spontaneously self&#8208;assembled into one&#8208;dimensional linear material&#160;during the crystal growth process. Furthermore, Ag15 can convert CO2 into&#160;CO with a faradaic efficiency of ~95.0% at &#8208;0.6 V and a maximal turnover
frequency of 6.37 s&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.1 V along with excellent long&#8208;term stability.&#160;Finally, density functional theory calculations disclosed that, Ag15(C&#8801;CtBu)11+ with one alkynyl ligand stripping off from the intact cluster can&#160;expose the uncoordinated Ag atom as the catalytically active site for CO&#160;formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Supernova: a deoxyribozyme that catalyzes a chemiluminescent&#160;reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional DNA molecules are useful components in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. To expand the toolkit of functional DNA parts, in this study we used artificial evolution to identify a glowing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This deoxyribozyme transfers a phosphate from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate to its 5' hydroxyl group, which triggers a chemiluminescent reaction and a flash of blue light. An engineered version of Supernova is only catalytically active in the presence of an oligonucleotide complementary to its 3' end, demonstrating that light production can be coupled to ligand binding. We anticipate that Supernova will be useful in a wide variety of applications, including as a signaling component in allosterically regulated sensors and in logic gates of molecular computers.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Functional Thermoplastic Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Properties by Scandium&#8208;Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Fluorostyrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) from ethylene and functionalized comonomers is of theoretical interest and practical importance. Herein, we report copolymerizations of ethylene (E) and  ortho&#8208;  /  meta&#8208;  /  para&#8208;  fluorostyrenes (S  F  =  o  FS/  m  FS/  p  FS) by using quinolyl methylene fluorenyl scandium complex (Flu&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;Qu)Sc(CH  2  SiMe  3  )  2  . The copolymerizations proceed in a controlled fashion to afford copolymers composed of &#8220;soft&#8221; ethylene&#8208;fluorostyurene (E&#8208;S  F  ) random segments (  T  g  = &#8208;22.2&#8208;5.1 &#176;C) and &#8220;hard&#8221; crystalline ethylene&#8208;ethylene (E&#8208;E) segments (  T  m  = 42.3&#8208;130.2 &#176;C). The copolymers behave like thermoplastic elastomers at room temperature by showing high stress values up to 39.5 MPa under elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break above 774% with elastic recovery over 75%. The excellent mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the microphase separation of the nanoscale crystalline E&#8208;E domain from the amorphous E&#8208;S  F  copolymer matrix proved by AFM, WAXD and SAXS. The mechanism investigation by the density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the steric bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing ligand of the catalytic precursor prefers E propagation to generate long E&#8208;E segments, while the incorporation of S  F  is thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. In this work, we report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K  3  (VO)(HV  2  O  3  )(PO  4  )  2  (HPO  4  ) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode can exhibit an initial reversible capacity of 80.6 mAh g  &#8722;1  under 20 mA g  &#8722;1  , with a large average working potential of 4.11 V. It can also manifest an excellent rate property of 54.4 mAh g  &#8722;1  under 5 A g  &#8722;1  , with an exceedingly high capacity preservation of 92.1% over 2500 cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from low&#8208;strain K  +  uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K  +  migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs. Our results show that this high&#8208;voltage low&#8208;strain phosphate material is a competitive cathode for PIBs and will draw more attention and investigations in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of a dilithiomethane with CO and N2O: An avenue to an anionic ketene and a hexafunctionalized benzene</title>

         <dc:description>Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the dianion [(Ph  2  P(S))  2  CLi  2  (THF)]  2  1  reacts with CO lead to C&#8208;C bond formation and migration of a Ph  2  P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N  2  O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8208;C bond affording [Ph  2  P(S)OLi(THF)  2  ]  2  4  and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph  2  P(S)CCOLi(THF)  2  5  . Heating  5  prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph  2  P(S)CCOLi(THF)  2  ]  3  6  regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of  13  C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Classification of Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides as a Tool for the Design of Inorganic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A classification of copper sulfides based on crystallographic features has been proposed from investigation of the structure&#8211;property relationships reported on their phases in dozens of publications from the fields of crystallography and materials for energy conversion. This classification reveals systematic trends that can be explained and exploited for the design and engineering of new environmentally friendly materials.







Abstract
Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties of inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension, and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth&#8208;abundant copper sulfides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulfides, associated with p&#8208; and/or d&#8208;block elements, is based on their crystallographic features and an analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimate some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) from consideration of only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies primarily on recent studies in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics as well as on crystal&#8208;structure investigations.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research focusing on the interplay between structural features and transport properties of inorganic materials is of paramount importance for the identification, comprehension, and optimisation of functional materials. In this respect, Earth-abundant copper sulfides have been receiving considerable attention from scientists as the urgency remains to discover and improve the efficiency of sustainable materials for energy applications. This proposed classification of copper sulfides, associated with p- and/or d-block elements, is based on their crystallographic features and an analysis of their transport properties. It provides guidelines to help estimate some properties of new materials (type of main charge carriers, thermal conductivity, transport mechanisms, etc.) from consideration of only their chemical composition and crystal structure. The classification relies primarily on recent studies in the fields of thermoelectricity and photovoltaics as well as on crystal-structure investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intragenomic Decarboxylation of 5&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A possibility that 5&#8208;carboxydC (cadC), which is a modification found in somatic and stem cells, is directly decarboxylated to dC via C&#8722;C bond cleavage in cells is suggested.







Abstract
Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleosides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three additional dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC), and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intragenomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. By using metabolic labelling, we show here that cadC decarboxylates in several cell types, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8722;C bond cleavage.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Phase&#8208;Recognition&#8208;Induced Domino Phase Transition and Luminescence Switching for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline phase recognition promoted the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transition of a metal halide by inducing a domino phase transition (DPT). A DPT occurred when single crystals of chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) recognized those of achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (see picture). Concomitant photoluminescence switching enabled in situ observation of the DPT, the potential of which for time&#8208;resolved encryption was demonstrated.







Abstract
Herein, a new mechanism, namely, crystalline phase recognition (CPR), is proposed for the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition of metal halides. Chiral &#946;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 (Bmmim=1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) can recognize achiral &#945;&#8208;[Bmmim]2SbCl5 on the basis of a key&#8211;lock feature through intercontact of their single crystals, resulting in a domino phase transition (DPT). The concomitant photoluminescence (PL) switching enables observation of the DPT in situ. The liquid eutectic interface, stress&#8211;strain transfer, and feasible thermodynamics are key issues for the CPR. DFT calculations and PL measurements revealed that the optical absorption and emission of the isomers mainly originate from [SbCl5]2&#8722; anions. The structural effects (e.g., supramolecular interactions and [SbCl5]2&#8722; distortion) on the optical emission are clarified. As a novel type of stimuli response, the CPR&#8208;induced DPT and luminescence switching exhibit potential for application in advanced time&#8208;resolved information encryption.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of a Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductive trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based coordination polymers (CPs) containing Ag&#8722;S bonds were synthesized using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted techniques. One of the obtained CPs, [Ag2Httc]n (KGF&#8208;6), features a three dimensionally extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with one&#8208;dimensional column structures of stacked triazine rings. This network structure provides segregated paths for holes and electrons (see picture).







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;sulfur bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties. However, the development of new (&#8208;M&#8208;S&#8208;)n&#8208;structured CPs is hindered by difficulties with their crystallization. Herein, we describe the use of machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H3ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8722;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag2Httc]n, features a 3D&#8208;extended infinite Ag&#8722;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag2Httc]n is highly photoconductive (&#966;&#931;&#956;max=1.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs with selective topologies that are difficult to crystallize.

         <title>Bright Luminescence in Three Phases&#8212;A Combined Synthetic, Spectroscopic and Theoretical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence of Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au (M=Cu, Ag, Au) &#8220;molecular wire&#8221; complexes was studied in detail by comparative measurements in solution, in the solid state and in the gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Combining phase&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements and quantum chemical calculations is a powerful approach to help understand the influence of the molecular surroundings on the PL properties. Herein, a phosphine functionalized amidinate was used to synthesize a recently presented bimetallic gold complex, featuring an unusual charge separation. The latter was subsequently used as metalloligand to yield heterotetrametallic complexes with an Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au &#8220;molecular wire&#8221; arrangement (M=Cu, Ag, Au) featuring metallophilic interactions. All compounds show bright phosphorescence in the solid state, also at ambient temperature. The effect of the molecular environment on the PL was studied in detail for these tetrametallic complexes by comparative measurements in solution, in the solid state and in the gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Dopant&#8208;Promoted Electroreduction of CO2 over Coordinatively Unsaturated Ni&#8208;N2 Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potential&#8208;dependent stability of doped S atom was observed in the dual&#8208;heteroatom anchored unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst prepared by a rapid microwave&#8208;induced plasma method. Sulfur dopants including coordinated S atoms and evolutive S vacancies effectively modulate coordination environment around Ni sites and further facilitate the CO2 reduction over the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N2 moieties.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed nickel&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C) moieties are promising for efficient electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. To improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, it is essential but challenging to steer the coordination environment of Ni centers for promoting the CO formation kinetics. Here, we introduce alien sulfur atoms to tune the local electronic density of unsaturated NiN2 species. A coordinated structure evolution is detected and S vacancies are generated at high overpotentials, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The sulfur dopants enhance CO selectivity and activity over normal unsaturated NiN2 structure, reaching a high CO Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a large CO current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;cell at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and &#8722;0.9&#8197;V (vs. RHE), respectively. DFT calculations reveal both doped S atoms and evolved S vacancies in the NiN2 coordination environment contribute to the reduced energy barriers for CO2 electroreduction to CO.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Spirolactams via Sequential C&#8722;H Olefination/Asymmetric [4+1] Spirocyclization under a Simple CoII/Chiral Spiro Phosphoric Acid Binary System</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple CoII/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported, providing a straightforward route for the asymmetric synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with high enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An unprecedented enantioselective synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple CoII/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported. A range of biologically important spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams are obtained with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The concise, asymmetric synthesis of an aldose reductase inhibitor was successfully achieved. Notably, contrast to previous reports that relied on the use of cyclopentadienyl or its derivatives (achiral Cp*, CptBu, or chiral Cpx) ligated CoIII complexes requiring tedious steps to prepare, cheap and commercially available cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate was used as an efficient precatalyst.

         <title>Lithium Ion Repulsion&#8208;Enrichment Synergism Induced by Core&#8211;Shell Ionic Complexes to Enable High&#8208;Loading Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as core and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as shell is proposed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The gradually released POM cores with negative charge enrich Li+ and co&#8208;assemble with Li. The Li+ repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
A core&#8211;shell additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as core and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as shell is proposed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The suspended POM derived complex in ether&#8208;based electrolyte is absorbed around the protuberances of anode and triggers a lithiophobic repulsion mechanism for the homogenization of Li+ redistribution. The gradually released POM cores with negative charge then enrich Li+ and co&#8208;assemble with Li. The Li+ repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce solid electrolyte interphase. This sustained&#8208;release additive enables Li&#8741;Li symmetric cells with a long lifetime over 500&#8197;h and 300&#8197;h at high current densities of 3 and 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. The complex additive is also compatible with high&#8208;voltage Li&#8741;LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cells. Even with a NCA loading as high as ca. 20&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the additive contained Li&#8741;NCA cell can still cycle for over 100&#8197;cycles at 2.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Doxorubicin&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence of NIR&#8208;Emitting Ytterbium Liposomes: Towards Direct Monitoring of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doxorubicin&#8208;sensitized near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission of Yb3+ is observable in solutions of liposomes encapsulating the drug and amphiphilic Yb3+ complexes. This emission vanishes when the liposome is destroyed and doxorubicin is released. The NIR Yb3+ luminescence could be observed in living mice with a commercial macroscopic setup.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;loaded liposomes are typical examples of nanomedicines. We show here that doxorubicin, the anti&#8208;cancer agent in the liposomal drug Doxil, can sensitize Ytterbium (Yb3+) and generate its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission. When doxorubicin and amphiphilic Yb3+ chelates are incorporated into liposomes, the sensitized emission of Yb3+ is dependent on the integrity of the particles, which can be used to monitor drug release. We also established the first demonstration that the NIR Yb3+ emission signal is observable in living mice following intratumoral injection of the Yb3+&#8208;doxorubicin&#8208;liposomes, using a commercial macroscopic setup equipped with a NIR camera.

         <title>Deep Learning for Voltammetric Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric (DLV) sensing platform is developed for highly selective and multiplexed analysis of neurochemicals in&#8197;vivo. With the DLV sensor, we reveal the interplay between the concentrations of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in the living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing methods. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite basic research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously in&#8197;vivo because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Herein, we present a deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric sensing platform for the highly selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in a living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial&#8208;temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplaying concentration changes of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously in&#8197;vivo because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Herein, we present a deep learning-based voltammetric sensing platform for the highly selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in a living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial-temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplaying concentration changes of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing-aided diagnostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Chiral Arylamines, Alkylamines and Amides by Enantioselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminations have been developed by using nitroarenes, hydroxylamines, or dioxazolones as aminating reagents. This modular process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral benzylic arylamines, alkylamines, and amides from styrenes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroarylamination, hydroalkylamination and hydroamidation of styrenes have been developed by NiH catalysis with a simple bioxazoline ligand under mild conditions. A wide range of enantioenriched benzylic arylamines, alkylamines and amides can be easily accessed by nitroarenes, hydroxylamines and dioxazolones, respectively as amination reagents. The chiral induction in these reactions is proposed to proceed through an enantiodifferentiating syn&#8208;hydronickellation step.

         <title>Nano&#8208;analysis Reveals High Fraction of Serotonin Release during Exocytosis from a Gut Epithelium Model Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gut&#8208;derived serotonin signaling plays key roles in the modulation of normal GI motility and inflammation. Electrochemical methods were used to study the release of serotonin during exocytosis in human carcinoid BON cells, which was found to be predominantly partial, with vesicles releasing a large fraction of serotonin during each exocytosis event. This finding provides new insights into therapeutic targets for treating GI diseases.







Abstract
Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in&#8197;vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut&#8208;derived 5&#8208;HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5&#8208;HT release in BON cells is 80&#8201;% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34&#8201;%). The fractional release increased from 80&#8201;% in control BON cells to 87&#8201;% with 5&#8208;HT preincubation and nearly 100&#8201;% with the combination of 5&#8208;HT and the 5&#8208;HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5&#8208;HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu  3  N@C  80  yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu  3  N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Configurational Lability in Aza&#8208;Sulfur Compounds for the Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for establishing the absolute configuration of sulfur&#8208;stereogenic aza&#8208;sulfur derivatives are scarce, often relying on cumbersome protocols and a limited pool of enantioenriched starting materials. We have addressed this by exploiting, for the first time, a feature of sulfonimidamides in which it is possible for tautomeric structures to also be enantiomeric. Such sulfonimidamides can readily generate prochiral ions, which we have exploited in an enantioselective alkylation process. Selectivity is achieved using a readily prepared bis&#8208;quaternized phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The overall process establishes the capability of configurationally labile aza&#8208;sulfur species to be used in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Is organic chemistry really growing exponentially?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In terms of molecules and specific reaction examples reported in the literature, organic chemistry features an impressive, exponential growth. However, new reaction classes/types that fuel this growth are being discovered at a much slower and only linear (or even sublinear) rate. In effect, the proportion of newly discovered reaction types to all reactions being performed keeps decreasing, suggesting that synthetic chemistry becomes more reliant on reusing the well&#8208;known methods. On the brighter side, the newly discovered chemistries are more complex than decades ago, and allow for the rapid construction of complex scaffolds in fewer numbers of steps. In this paper, we study these and other trends in the function of time, reaction&#8208;type &#8220;popularity&#8221; and complexity based on the algorithm that extracts generalized reaction class templates. These analyses are useful in the context of computer&#8208;assisted synthesis, machine learning (to estimate the numbers of models with sufficient reaction statistics), and also for identifying erroneous entries in reaction databases.</dc:description>

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroallylation of Aryl Halides and Pseudo Halides with Difluoroallylboron Reagents in High Regioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed  gem  &#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl halides and pseudo halides with 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronates in high yield with high regioselectivity, and we report the preparation of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl boronate reactants by a copper&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative borylation of inexpensive gaseous 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene with bis(pinacolato)diboron. The  gem  &#8208;difluoroallylation of aryl and heteroaryl bromides proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.1 mol% [Pd]) and tolerates a wide range of functional groups, including primary alcohols, secondary amines, ethers, ketones, esters, amides, aldehydes, nitriles, halides, and nitro groups. This protocol extends to aryl iodides, chlorides, and triflates, as well as substituted difluoroallyl boronates, providing a versatile synthesis of  gem  &#8208;difluoroallyl arenes that we show to be valuable intermediates to a series of fluorinated building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platform for Site&#8208;Specific DNA&#8208;Antibody Bioconjugation by Using Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many bioconjugation strategies for DNA oligonucleotides and antibodies suffer limitations, such as site&#8208;specificity, stoichiometry and hydrolytic instability of the conjugates, which makes them unsuitable for biological applications. Here, we report a new platform for the preparation of DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates with a simple benzoylacrylic acid pentafluorophenyl ester reagent. Benzoylacrylic&#8208;labelled oligonucleotides prepared with this reagent can be site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a range of proteins and antibodies through accessible cysteine residues. The homogeneity of the prepared DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates was confirmed by a new LC&#8211;MS protocol and the bioconjugate probes were used in fluorescence or super&#8208;resolution microscopy cell imaging experiments. This work demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our bioconjugation protocol that gives site&#8208;specific, well&#8208;defined and plasma&#8208;stable DNA&#8208;antibody bioconjugates for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, structure and reactivity of a cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH  2  ] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 = 1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl  N  &#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)  2  C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the  N  &#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]  &#8722;  . Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Nanozyme Platform with Activity&#8208;Correlated Ratiometric Molecular Imaging for Predicating Therapeutic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like characteristics have attracted enormous research interest in biological application, due to their higher catalytic stability and activity than many natural enzymes. However, there is still a lack of facile approach for real&#8208;time evaluating the catalytic activity of nanozymes in living system, which limits their application in precise treatment of disease. Herein, we develop a novel manganese&#8208;semiconducting polymer&#8208;based nanozyme (MSPN) with oxidase&#8208;like activity for dynamically reporting the catalytic activity of itself in acid&#8208;induced cancer therapy via ratiometric near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF)&#8208;photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging. Notably, MSPN possess oxidase&#8208;like activity in tumor microenvironment, owing to the mixed&#8208;valent MnOx nanoparticles ((Mn II  ) 1  (Mn III  ) 1.56  (Mn IV  ) 1.4  O 6.14  ), which can effectively kill cancer cells. Because the semiconducting polymer (PFODBT) is conjugated with oxidase&#8208;responsive molecule (ORM) via amide bond, the catalyitic activity of nanozyme can be correlated with the ratiometric sginals of NIRF (FL 695  /FL 825  ) and PA (PA 680  /PA 780  ). Therefore, our integrated catalyitic and imaging platform represents an innovative strategy that can not only achieve effective catalyitic activity in vivo, but also be used to real&#8208;time monitor the nanozyme acitivity itself, which may provide new ideas for predicating anticancer effiecncy of nanozymes in biological condition.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Generation of Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Triply&#8208;Reduced Warped Nanographenes: Charge&#8208;Dependent Aromaticity, Surface Nonequivalence, Swing Distortion and Metal Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stepwise chemical reduction of molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved  &#960;  &#8208;surface and defined C  80  H  30  composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of contorted nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs  +  ions has been confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted  &#960;  &#8208;surface of WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting nanosized carbanions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrosobenzene&#8208;Enabled Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomeric N&#8208;Arylbenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is an imidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol. It is worth reflecting on the unique roles played by the nitroso group in this domino reaction. It functions as a linchpin by first offering an electrophilic site (N) for the initial C&#8208;N bond formation while the resulting amine performs the nucleophilic addition to form the second C&#8208;N bond. Additionally, it could facilitate the final oxidative aromatization as an oxidant. The atropisomeric products could be conveniently elaborated to a series of axially chiral derivatives, enabling the exploitation of N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles for their potential utilities in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering and Suppressing the Over&#8208;oxidized Nitrogen in Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrolysis is a prospective technology for simultaneous H2  production and nitrogen abatement toward water&#8208;energy nexus. Its sustainability is currently founded on the innocuous N2  products; however, herein, we discovered the prevalent nickel&#8208;based catalysts could generally over&#8208;oxidize urea into NO2&#8208;  products with ~80% Faradaic efficiencies, posing potential secondary hazard to the environment. Trace amounts of over&#8208;oxidized NO3&#8208;  and N2O were also detected. By  15N isotopes and urea analogues, we derived a nitrogen fate network, involving a NO2&#8208;  formation pathway  via  OH&#8208;&#8208;assisted C&#8208;N cleavage and two N2  formation pathways of intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular coupling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirmed that C&#8208;N cleavage is energetically more favorable. Inspired by the mechanism, a polyaniline coating strategy was developed to locally enrich urea for encouraging N2  production by 2&#8208;folds. These findings provide complementary insights into the nitrogen fate in water&#8208;energy nexus systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework derived CuxOyCz Catalyst for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction and Impact of Local pH Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nanostructured CuxOyCz electrocatalysts were synthesized from Cu&#8208;based MOF precursors. The catalysts were blended with PTFE for preparation of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to suppress hydrogen evolution by preventing electrowetting process. The local OH&#8722; ion activities of working GDEs were determined in absence and presence of PTFE to exclude interference in local OH&#8722; ion generation in the vicinity of GDE by PTFE.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to produce value&#8208;added chemicals has been intensively pursued. We report a series of CuxOyCz nanostructured electrocatalysts derived from a Cu&#8208;based MOF as porous self&#8208;sacrificial template. Blending catalysts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. 25 to 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% teflonized GDEs exhibited a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;54&#8201;% for C2+ products at &#8722;80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The local OH&#8722; ions activity of PTFE&#8208;modified GDEs was assessed by means of closely positioning a Pt&#8208;nanoelectrode. A substantial increase in the OH&#8722;/H2O activity ratio due to the locally generated OH&#8722; ions at increasing current densities was determined irrespective of the PTFE amount.

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Water&#8208;Stable B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Serving as a Host Material for a Phosphorescent OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene (see structure) featuring a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap was synthesized and found to exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stability. The compound has a high T1 energy and can therefore emit short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence comparable to that of benzene. Owing to its photophysical properties, the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene served as a good host material for a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Replacement of the carbon&#8211;carbon bonds of antiaromatic compounds with polar boron&#8211;nitrogen bonds often provides isoelectronic BN compounds with excellent thermodynamic stability and interesting photophysical properties. By this element&#8208;substitution strategy, we synthesized a new B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene derivative, 1, which is fully substituted with mesityl groups. Owing to kinetic protection by the sterically bulky substituents, 1 is remarkably stable toward air and even water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 revealed the bonding characteristics of the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene structure. In a glassy matrix, 1 emitted short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with an onset at 350&#8197;nm, indicating that the triplet energy is substantially high. DFT calculations reasonably explained the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state electronic structures of 1 as well as its emission properties. Motivated by the high&#8208;energy triplet state of 1, we used it as a host material to fabricate a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 15&#8201;%.

         <title>Single Particle Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals the Catalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Co3O4 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SECCM and the single&#8208;particle&#8208;at&#8208;the&#8208;tip approach are allied to gain insight into the activity of individual Co3O4 nanocube particles towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The single&#8208;particle&#8208;at&#8208;the&#8208;tip approach offers the ability to perform accelerated stress tests combined with HR&#8208;TEM to observe structural changes of the nanoparticle during electrocatalysis at high current densities.







Abstract
Co3O4 nanocubes are evaluated concerning their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by means of single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co3O4 nanocube of a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;nanoelectrode measurements of Co3O4 nanocubes provide an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8&#215;104&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.92&#8197;V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such high current densities combined with identical&#8208;location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer during electrocatalysis. Combining two independent single&#8208;entity electrochemistry techniques provides the basis for elucidating structure&#8211;activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well&#8208;defined surface structure.

Single-particle-on-nanoelectrode measurements of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocubes provide an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.92&#8197;V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such high current densities combined with identical-location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer during electrocatalysis. Combining two independent single-entity electrochemistry techniques provides the basis for elucidating structure&#8211;activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well-defined surface structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Lipooligosaccharide Antigen from the Opportunistic Pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The outer surfaces of mycobacteria, including the organism that causes tuberculosis, are decorated with an array of immunomodulatory glycans. Among these are lipooligosaccharides (LOS), a class of molecules for which the function remains poorly understood. We describe the chemical synthesis of the glycan portion of a tridecasaccharide LOS (2) from the opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium kansasii. The target contains a number of unusual structural motifs that complicate its assembly. This report describes the first syntheses related to M. kansasii LOSs and 2 is the most complex mycobacterial LOS glycan to be synthesized to date when considering size and number of unique monosaccharides and glycosidic linkages. These studies not only provide a roadmap for the preparation of additional members of this family of glycans, but also provides a valuable probe for use in structure&#8211;activity relationship investigations</dc:description>

         <title>Rotation in an Enantiospecific Self&#8208;Assembled Array of Molecular Raffle Wheels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic one&#8208;component system &#8212; a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule &#8212; employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95 eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilizes the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest&#8217;s enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (Ia3d) to double diamond (Pn m) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and&#160;HII&#160;phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to the bound and the interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid&#8217;s polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is bonded to the headgroup of lipids in&#160;HII&#160;phase at higher temperature than in cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.</dc:description>

         <title>Strongly Coupled Cobalt Diselenide Monolayers Selectively Catalyze Oxygen Reduction to H2O2 in an Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth&#8208;abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), which creates high&#8208;performance catalyst to selectively drive two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction toward H2O2 in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe2 atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H2O2 production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe2 catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7%, current density of 50.04 milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60 mg cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8208;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100 hours</dc:description>

         <title>Studying conversion mechanism to broaden cathode options in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are regarded as alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries benefiting from both improved safety and environmental impact in addition to being easy to manufacture at scale. The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn&#8208;ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn&#8208;ion storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn&#8208;ion intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn&#8208;ion intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7 mA h g&#8208;1) and Cu2O (374.5 mA h g&#8208;1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn&#8208;ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next&#8208;generation ZIBs.</dc:description>

The widespread application of ZIBs, however, is compromised by the lack of high-performance cathodes. Currently, only the intercalation mechanism is widely reported in aqueous ZIBs, which significantly limits cathode options. Beyond Zn-ion intercalation, we comprehensively study the conversion mechanism for Zn-ion storage and its diffusion pathway in a CuI cathode, indicating that CuI occurs a direct conversion reaction without Zn-ion intercalation due to the high energy barrier for Zn-ion intercalation and migration. Importantly, this direct conversion reaction mechanism can be readily generalized to other high-capacity cathodes, such as Cu2S (336.7 mA h g-1) and Cu2O (374.5 mA h g-1), indicating its practical universality. Our work enriches the Zn-ion storage mechanism and significantly broadens the cathode horizons towards next-generation ZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed s&#8208;Block Magnesium Sites for Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed transition metal sites have been extensively studied for CO  2  electroredution reaction (CO  2  RR) to CO due to their robust CO  2  activation ability. However, the strong hybridization between directionally localized d orbits and CO vastly limits CO desorption and thus the activities of atomically d ispersed transition metal sites. In contrast, s&#8208;block metal sites possess nondirectional ly delocalized 3s orbits and hence weak CO adsorption ability, providing a promising way to solve the suffered CO desorption issue. Herein , we constructed atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitic carbon nitride ( Mg&#8208;C  3  N  4  ) through a facile heat treatment for CO  2  RR . Theoretical calculations show that the CO desorption on Mg sites is easier than that on Fe and Co sites. This theoretical prediction is demonstrated by experimental CO temperature program desorption and  in&#8208;situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. As a result, Mg&#8208;C  3  N  4  exhibits a high turnover frequency of&#160;~ 18,000 per hour in H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8208;300 mA/cm  2  in flow cell , under a high CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90% in KHCO  3  electrolyte . This work sheds a new light on s&#8208;block metal sites for efficient CO  2  RR to CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Fe&#8208;spin State Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe  1  &#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe  1  &#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials.  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe  1  &#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin&#160; single&#8208;Fe  3+  &#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN  4  &#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe  1  &#8208;NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin&#8208;state&#8208;determined ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>APEX2&#8208;based Proximity Labeling of Atox1 Identifies CRIP2 as a Nuclear Copper&#8208;binding Protein that Regulates Autophagy Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper&#8217;s broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine&#8208;rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8217;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2&#8212;as well as copper&#8208;induced CRIP2 degradation&#8212;elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2&#8208;mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.</dc:description>

Ruthenium&#8208;NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones to simple 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones has been developed with high yields and moderate to excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Direct enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds to generate chiral three&#8208;dimensional motifs is one of the most straightforward and important approaches in synthetic chemistry. We realized the Ru(II)&#8208;NHC&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 2&#8208;quinolones under mild reaction conditions. Alkyl&#8208;, aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted optically active dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones were obtained in high yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The reaction provides an efficient and atom&#8208;economic pathway to construct simple chiral 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;quinolones. The desired products could be further reduced to tetrahydroquinolines and octahydroquinolones.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Cell Membrane Phase Separation for Improved Peptide Drug Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutic peptides have been widely concerned because of their good biocompatibility, but their efficacy is limited by the inability to penetrate cell membranes, which is a key bottleneck in peptide drugs delivery. Herein, an  in vivo  self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization and anticancer efficacy. A phosphopeptide KYp is synthesized, containing an anticancer peptide [KLAKLAK]  2  (K) and a responsive moiety phosphorylated Y (Yp). After interacting with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on the cell membrane, KYp can be dephosphorylated and self&#8208;assembles  in situ  , which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation on the cell membrane. ALP is involved in the assembly of peptides, forming the large aggregates and entering cells, which leads to the enhanced permeability of cell membrane. Consequently, the peptide drugs internalization is ~2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide nanoparticle, and IC  50  value of KYp is approximately ~5 times lower than that of free peptide. Finally, the tumor of mice treated with KYp is suppressed effectively, showing the negligible side effect  in vivo  . Therefore, the  in vivo  self&#8208;assembly induced phase separation on the cell membrane promises a new strategy to improve the drug delivery efficacy in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Zwitterionic Heterobimetallic Gold&#8211;Iron Complex Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine)Silyliumylidene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of a silyliumylidene&#8208;stabilized mononuclear Au&#8722;Fe complex, by a convenient one&#8208;pot reaction starting from bis&#8208;NHI silyliumylidene chloride, is reported. X&#8208;ray crystallography, IR and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, as well as computations suggest a zwitterionic Si(II)+&#8722;Au(I)+&#8722;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8722; bonding motif with rare anagostic CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au contacts and considerable backbonding capabilities of the silyliumylidene.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of the first bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic imine&#8208;stabilized chlorosilyliumylidene 1 is reported. Remarkably, consecutive reaction of 1 with PPh3AuCl and K2Fe(CO)4 gives rise to the unique heterobimetallic complex 1,2&#8208;(MesNHI)2&#8208;C2H4&#8208;ClSiAuFe(CO)4 (4). The overall neutral complex 4 bears an unusual linear Si&#8722;Au&#8722;Fe structure and a rare anagostic interaction between the d10&#8208;configured gold atom and a CH bond of the mesityl ligand. According to the computational analysis and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, the formal Fe&#8208;oxidation state remains at &#8722;II. Thus, the electronic structure of 4 is best described as an overall neutral&#8212;yet zwitterionic&#8212;heterobimetallic &#8220;Si(II)+&#8208;Au(I)+&#8208;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8722;&#8221;&#8208;silyliumylidene complex, derived from double anion exchange. The computational analysis indicates strong hyperconjugative back donation from the gold(I) atom to the silyliumylidene ligand.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Dominated Stable N97 Respirators for Airborne Virus Capture Based on Nanofibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity&#8208;driven air filtration approach is achieved based on the thin&#8208;film coated PAN nanofibrous membranes (TFPNMs), possessing a superior filtration efficiency reaching to N97 grade with outstanding longevity and reusability compared with the N95 FFRs. The TFPNMs can be reused upon various disinfection treatments, giving great potential for personal health care.







Abstract
The longevity and reusability of N95&#8208;grade filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin&#8208;film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long&#8208;lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42&#8197;Pa&#8722;1 (filtration efficiency: over 97&#8201;%; pressure drop: around 10&#8197;Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8211;0.41&#8197;Pa&#8722;1) tested with a flow rate of 5&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1 and the 0.26&#8197;&#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67&#8201;%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.

         <title>Anodic Dehydrogenative Cyanamidation of Thioethers: Simple and Sustainable Synthesis of N&#8208;Cyanosulfilimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel, robust and scalable electrochemical route for synthesis of N&#8208;cyanosulfilimines is described. The reaction provides good to excellent yields for dialkyl and alkylaryl sulfilimines. Compared to established routes no external oxidizers or strong bases are required. The synthesis provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by further oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate.







Abstract
A novel and very simple to perform electrochemical approach for the synthesis of several N&#8208;cyanosulfilimines in good to excellent yields was established. This method provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by consecutive oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate. This route can be easily scaled&#8208;up to gram quantities. The S,N coupling is carried out at an inexpensive carbon anode by direct oxidation of sulfide. Therefore, the designed process is atom economic and represents a new &#8220;green route&#8221; for the synthesis of sulfilimines and sulfoximines.

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Red Laser with a Single Longitudinal Mode from Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14 nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8 dB. Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Using stereochemistry to control mechanical properties in thiol&#8208;yne click&#8208;hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of polymers has a profound impact on their mechanical properties. While this has been observed in thermoplastics, studies on how stereochemistry affects the bulk properties of swollen networks, such as hydrogels, are limited. Typically, changing the stiffness of a hydrogel is achieved at the cost of changing another parameter, that in turn affects the physical properties of the material and ultimately influences the cellular response. Herein, we report that by manipulating the stereochemistry of a double bond, formed in situ during gelation, materials with diverse mechanical properties but comparable physical properties can be obtained. Click&#8208;hydrogels that possess a high %  trans  content are stiffer than their high %  cis  analogues by almost a factor of 3. Human mesenchymal stem cells acted as a substrate stiffness cell reporter demonstrating the potential of these platforms to study mechanotransduction without the influence of other external factors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two novel light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch&#160;1&#160;and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch&#160;2&#160;, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible&#160;Z/E&#160;photoisomerization irradiated with 450 nm blue and 365 nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. Interestingly, in contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch&#160;2, exposure of the system incorporating switch&#160;1&#160;to 365 nm and 450 nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Templating Growth of Homeostatic GeP Nano&#8208;Bar Corals with Fast Electron&#8208;Ion Transportation Pathways for High Performance Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a nascent anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs)  , layered germanium phosphide (GeP) boasts excellent potential due to its high capacity  , decent conductivity, and excellent theoretically calculated Li  +  diffusion coefficient.  However, in reality, GeP usually suffers from relatively slow  Li  +  di&#64256;usion and poor cycling stability  associated with its sti&#64256; bulky structure as synthesized using conventional mixing&#8208;sintering method, in which the predicted quickest electron&#8208;ion transport pathways tend to be concealed.  Herein,  for the first time,  we propose an in&#8208;situ template method  to directionally induce the construction of GeP nanobar  (GeP&#8208;nb) coral  s with an adjustable  aspect ratio  .  The GeP nanobars grown onto conductive matrix with high aspect ratio expose more quickest electron&#8208;ion transportation facets for fast reaction dynamics, which not only is the first verification of the theoretical prediction, but also reveals the underlying mechanism of crystal orientation optimization on the electrochemical behavior of GeP&#8208;based materials.  Besides,  the customized GeP&#8208;nb electrode delivers a self&#8208;healable homeostatic behavior by reversibly stabilizing  GeP crystalline structure through multi&#8208;phase reactions to maintain structural integrity and cycling stability (850 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 1 A g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles). As a result,  the GeP&#8208;nb presents the highest Li  +  diffusion coefficient (6.21&#215;10  &#8208;11  cm  2  s  &#8208;1  ) among all the Ge&#8208;based anode materials studied so far, rendering an excellent rate performance (620 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  ) as a LIBs anode.  This unique in&#8208;situ structural regulation strategy for improved ion diffusion points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of novel electrode materials for futuristic high energy density batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Crystalline Covalent&#8208;Triazine&#8208;Framework Nanosheets with Electron Donor Groups for Synergistically Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate great potential for photocatalytic applications, however, suffer from enlarged bandgap and narrowed visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range due to the quantum confinement effect. Herein, we report a novel redox strategy for efficient preparation of ultrathin crystalline amide&#8208;functionalized covalent&#8208;triazine&#8208;framework nanosheets (CTF NSs) with enhanced visible light absorption for the first time. The obtained CTF NSs exhibited remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen (512.3 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  ) and oxygen (12.37 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  ) evolution rates, 17 and 23 times higher than that of pristine bulk CTF, respectively. Moreover, the photocatalytic overall water splitting could also be achieved by the CTF NSs with efficient stoichiometric H  2  (5.13 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  ) and O  2  (2.53 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  ) evolution rates under visible light irradiation, which is superior to previous CTFs/covalent&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;based photocatalytic materials. Experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that introduction of a small amount of amide groups as electron donor in the CTF NSs could optimize its band structure and improve its visible&#8208;light absorption, hydrophilicity and carrier separation efficiency, thus resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance. Additionally, the well&#8208;dispersed CTF NSs could be easily casted onto a support as a thin film device and demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activity (25.7 mmol h  &#8208;1  m  &#8208;2  for hydrogen evolution), which has rarely been achieved before.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lamellar phases of alkyldiacetylenes, in which the alkyl chains lie parallel to the substrate, represent a straightforward means for scalable 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution interfacial patterning. This capability has the potential for substantial impacts in nanoscale electronics, energy conversion, and biomaterials design. Polymerization is required to set the 1&#8208;nm functional patterns embedded in the monolayer, making it important to understand structure&#8211;function relationships for these on&#8208;surface reactions. Polymerization can be observed for certain monomers at the single&#8208;polymer scale using scanning probe microscopy.

         <title>Direct Photoexcitation of Ethynylbenziodoxolones: An Alternative to Photocatalysis for Alkynylation Reactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl ethynylbenziodoxolones (ArEBXs) can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. In the excited state, ArEBXs act as strong oxidants, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides, and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs) are commonly used as radical traps in photocatalytic alkynylations. Herein, we report that aryl&#8208;substituted EBX reagents can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. They act as both oxidants and radical traps, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in several reported EBX&#8208;mediated processes, including decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF. Furthermore, the method could be applied to the synthesis of alkynylated quaternary centers from tertiary alcohols via stable oxalate salts and from tertiary amines via aryl imines. A photocatalytic process using 4CzIPN as an organic dye was also developed for the deoxyalkynylation of oxalates.

         <title>A TiO2&#8208;Co(terpyridine)2 Photocatalyst for the Selective Oxidation of Cellulose to Formate Coupled to the Reduction of CO2 to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocatalyst consisting of a phosphonated cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst immobilized on TiO2 powder allows coupling of aqueous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (CO and H2) reduction with the selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates or cellulose to formate. Thus, the simultaneous conversion of two waste streams into sustainable chemicals using sunlight is demonstrated.







Abstract
Immobilization of a phosphonated cobalt bis(terpyridine) catalyst on TiO2 nanoparticles generates a photocatalyst that allows coupling aqueous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (CO and H2) reduction to selective oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived oxygenates or cellulose to formate. An enzymatic saccharification pre&#8208;treatment process is employed that enables the use of insoluble cellulose as an electron&#8208;donating substrate under benign aqueous conditions suitable for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. The hybrid photocatalyst consists of solely earth&#8208;abundant components, and its heterogeneous nature allows for reuse and operation in aqueous solution for several days at 25&#8201;&#176;C, reaching a cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion yield of 17&#8201;%. Thus, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for valorizing two waste streams (CO2 and biomass) simultaneously into value&#8208;added chemicals through solar&#8208;driven catalysis is demonstrated.

         <title>Subsurface&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Induced Local Charge of Copper for an On&#8208;Surface Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By subsurface doping with carbon, local charge is introduced to the surface Cu atoms of Cu(111), which enables an instant on&#8208;surface displacement reaction. The well&#8208;defined and robust Cu&#948;+ surface offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis. The strategy based on subsurface doping with non&#8208;metal atoms provides an efficient path to improve the catalytic performance of the parent metal.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal carbides have sparked unprecedented enthusiasm as high&#8208;performance catalysts in recent years. Still, the catalytic properties of copper carbide remain unexplored. By introducing subsurface carbon to Cu(111), a displacement reaction of a proton in a carboxyl acid group with a single Cu atom is demonstrated at the atomic scale and room temperature. Its occurrence is attributed to the C&#8208;doping&#8208;induced local charge of surface Cu atoms (up to +0.30&#8197;e/atom), which accelerates the rate of on&#8208;surface deprotonation via reduction of the corresponding energy barrier, thus enabling the instant displacement of a proton with a Cu atom when the molecules adsorb on the surface. This well&#8208;defined and robust Cu&#948;+ surface based on subsurface&#8208;carbon doping offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A continuous flow platform that is able to concatenate multiple steps for rapid, multi&#8208;gram production of orthogonally protected deoxy&#8208;sugars is described. Intermediate purification of compounds is avoided by the ability to run telescoped sequences of 2&#8211;4 chemical transformations. Through the use of Mechwolf, an open&#8208;source, Python&#8208;controlled program, automation of the flow processes was achieved.







Abstract
An automated continuous flow system capable of producing protected deoxy&#8208;sugar donors from commercial material is described. Four 2,6&#8208;dideoxy and two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy sugars with orthogonal protecting groups were synthesized in 11&#8211;32&#8201;% overall yields in 74&#8211;131.5&#8197;minutes of total reaction time. Several of the reactions were able to be concatenated into a continuous process, avoiding the need for chromatographic purification of intermediates. The modular nature of the experimental setup allowed for reaction streams to be split into different lines for the parallel synthesis of multiple donors. Further, the continuous flow processes were fully automated and described through the design of an open&#8208;source Python&#8208;controlled automation platform.

         <title>Interfacial Linkage and Carbon Encapsulation Enable Full Solution&#8208;Printed Perovskite Photovoltaics with Prolonged Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple amphiphilic silane interfacial linkage strategy was employed to realize fully&#8208;printed all carbon&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a high efficiency of 18.64&#8201;%, accompanied by excellent device stability over 3000 hours.







Abstract
Simplified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) by a fully blade&#8208;coated process. A self&#8208;assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage. The AS serves as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221; to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, facilitating the interfacial charge extraction, increasing PCEs by 77&#8201;% and reducing hysteresis. A PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was achieved for the fully printed devices, one of the highest reported for carbon&#8208;based PSCs. AS&#8208;assisted interfacial linkage and carbon&#8208;material&#8208;assisted self&#8208;encapsulation enhance the stability of the PSCs, which did not experience performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for over 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>A Desolvation&#8208;Free Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry for High Power Density and Extremely Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery was fabricated by combining reversible anion doping in a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode and co&#8208;intercalation of a Na+&#8208;solvent complex in an artificial graphite (AG) anode, which demonstrates super&#8208;fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (100C&#8208;rate) at 25&#8201;&#176;C, maintaining 61&#8201;% at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C compared to its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The development of conventional rechargeable batteries based on intercalation chemistry in the fields of fast charge and low temperature is generally hindered by the sluggish cation&#8208;desolvation process at the electrolyte/electrode interphase. To address this issue, a novel desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery (SDIB) has been proposed by using artificial graphite (AG) as anode and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as cathode. Combining the cation solvent co&#8208;intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether&#8208;based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (corresponding to 100C&#8208;rate) with a high capacity retention of 45&#8201;%. Moreover, the desolvation&#8208;free mechanism endows the battery with 61&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This advanced battery system will open a door for designing energy storage devices that require high power density and a wide operational temperature range.

Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (corresponding to 100C-rate) with a high capacity retention of 45&#8201;%. Moreover, the desolvation-free mechanism endows the battery with 61&#8201;% of its room-temperature capacity at an ultra-low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This advanced battery system will open a door for designing energy storage devices that require high power density and a wide operational temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Reverse Intersystem Crossing and Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophors with Multiple Through&#8208;space Charge Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescent molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8211;acceptor motif are constructed to realize both fast radiative decay and reverse intersystem crossing, thanks to the enhanced multiple&#8208;charge transfers and near&#8208;degenerate excited states. The optimized device exhibits narrow&#8208;band green electroluminescence with a EQEmax/CIEy of 31.6&#8201;%/0.69, being the purest green bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with through&#8208;space charge transfers (CT) have attracted particularly interest recently. However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative decay always limit their electroluminescence performances. Herein, TADF molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8208;acceptor (ortho&#8208;Dn&#8208;A) motif are developed to create near&#8208;degenerate excited states for the reinforcement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The incorporation of both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space CT enlarges oscillator strength. The optimal ortho&#8208;D3&#8208;A compound exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of ca. 100&#8201;%, a high RISC rate of 2.57&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a high radiative decay rate of 1.00&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. With this compound as the sensitizer, a TADF&#8208;sensitized&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6&#8201;% with an ultrapure green Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinate value of 0.69.

         <title>The Structure of Cyclodecatriene Collinolactone, its Biosynthesis, and Semisynthetic Analogues: Effects of Monoastral Phenotype and Protection from Intracellular Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collinolactone shares the same carbon scaffold with rhizolutin and X&#8208;ray crystallography has provided the absolute configuration. A highly non&#8208;collinear gene cluster was identified. Studies of cell viability using fluorescence microscopy revealed that analogues of collinolactone induce the formation of a monopolar spindle phenotype while collinolactone showed neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular oxidative stress.







Abstract
Recently described rhizolutin and collinolactone isolated from Streptomyces G&#246;&#8197;40/10 share the same novel carbon scaffold. Analyses by NMR and X&#8208;Ray crystallography verify the structure of collinolactone and propose a revision of rhizolutin's stereochemistry. Isotope&#8208;labeled precursor feeding shows that collinolactone is biosynthesized via type&#8197;I polyketide synthase with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation. CRISPR&#8208;based genetic strategies led to the identification of the biosynthetic gene cluster and a high&#8208;production strain. Chemical semisyntheses yielded collinolactone analogues with inhibitory effects on L929 cell line. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that only particular analogues induce monopolar spindles impairing cell division in mitosis. Inspired by the Alzheimer&#8208;protective activity of rhizolutin, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of collinolactone and its analogues on glutamate&#8208;sensitive cells (HT22) and indeed, natural collinolactone displays distinct neuroprotection from intracellular oxidative stress.

         <title>Unraveling a Ligand&#8208;Induced Twist of a Homodimeric Enzyme by Pulsed Electron&#8211;Electron Double Resonance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR or DEER), an equilibrium was observed between the functional and the twisted dimer of the enzyme tRNA&#8208;guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a virulence&#8208;relevant target of shigellosis, which depends on the chemical structure of the bound ligand. The experiments suggest a dissociation&#8211;association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer.







Abstract
Mechanistic insights into protein&#8211;ligand interactions can yield chemical tools for modulating protein function and enable their use for therapeutic purposes. For the homodimeric enzyme tRNA&#8208;guanine transglycosylase (TGT), a putative virulence target of shigellosis, ligand binding has been shown by crystallography to transform the functional dimer geometry into an incompetent twisted one. However, crystallographic observation of both end states does neither verify the ligand&#8208;induced transformation of one dimer into the other in solution nor does it shed light on the underlying transformation mechanism. We addressed these questions in an approach that combines site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL) with distance measurements based on pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) spectroscopy. We observed an equilibrium between the functional and twisted dimer that depends on the type of ligand, with a pyranose&#8208;substituted ligand being the most potent one in shifting the equilibrium toward the twisted dimer. Our experiments suggest a dissociation&#8211;association mechanism for the formation of the twisted dimer upon ligand binding.

         <title>The Reaction of CO2 with a Borylnitrene: Formation of an 3&#8208;Oxaziridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet borylnitrene 1 reacts photochemically (&#955;&gt;550&#8197;nm) under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions with CO2, which is known for its high thermodynamic and kinetic stability, to give a strained and unprecedented 3&#8208;oxaziridinone motif 2.







Abstract
The reaction of a borylnitrene with carbon dioxide is studied under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions. Photogenerated CatBN (Cat=catecholato) reacts with CO2 under formation of the cycloaddition product CatBNCO2, a 3&#8208;oxaziridinone derivative, after photoexcitation (&gt;550&#8197;nm). The product shows Fermi resonances between the CO stretching and ring deformation modes that cause unusual 13C and 18O isotopic shifts. A computational analysis of the 3&#8208;oxaziridinone shows this cyclic carbamate to be less strained than an &#945;&#8208;lactone or an &#945;&#8208;lactame.

         <title>Revealing the Side&#8208;Chain Dependent Ordering Transition of Highly&#8208;Crystalline Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly&#8208;crystalline conjugated polymers are important for microstructure analysis and charge transport in organic electronics. In this work, we have developed a series of highly&#8208;crystalline double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. The highly&#8208;crystalline nature of these materials allows us to systematically study the effect of the length of the alkyl linkers on the nanostructure and photovoltaic performance. In particular, we find that for double&#8208;cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion, resulting in large d&#8208;spacing (e.g. 64 &#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H&#8208;aggregation, resulting in short d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 50 &#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker). Evidence for this transition is provided by X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements along with cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy measurements, where different packing motifs of the PBI units are clearly imaged. The different packing facilitated by longer linker groups is associated with improved exciton separation and charge transport, resulting in enhanced efficiencies of SCOSCs based on the polymer P16. The findings in this work demonstrate that double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers can be an important family of highly&#8208;crystalline conjugated polymers. Furthermore, this work demonstrates how the precise molecular packing of the acceptor units influences the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly-crystalline conjugated polymers are important for microstructure analysis and charge transport in organic electronics. In this work, we have developed a series of highly-crystalline double-cable conjugated polymers for application in single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. The highly-crystalline nature of these materials allows us to systematically study the effect of the length of the alkyl linkers on the nanostructure and photovoltaic performance. In particular, we find that for double-cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head-to-head fashion, resulting in large d-spacing (e.g. 64 &#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H-aggregation, resulting in short d-spacings (e.g. 50 &#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker).

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Dicationic Diazahexabenzocoronene Derivative on the Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomically precise control over the size, shape and structure of nanographenes (NGs) or the introduction of heteroatom dopants into their sp2&#8208;carbon lattice confer them valuable electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice, achieved via on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic NG. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements reveal a considerable variation of the local contact potential difference toward lower values with respect to the gold surface, indicative of its positive net charge. Altogether, we introduce the concept of cationic nitrogen doping of NGs on surfaces, opening new avenues for the design of novel carbon nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing the differentiated functions of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids is the basis of constructing single&#8208;molecule semiconductor elements as a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a feasible molecular design of the binuclear clusters featuring the n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction of biligand&#8208;sandwiched inorganic units, which can be used as the effective charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories with the large memory windows and the energy&#8208;saving operation.  We find that the hole confinement on the p&#8208;type inorganic units is enhanced by spatial electronic anisotropy provided by the peripheral n&#8208;type organic phosphine ligands. The steric hindrance of the coordination sites, the insulating effect of the carbon&#8208;phosphorous single bonds and the parallel dual&#8208;ligand coordination mode jointly elongate the interunit distances to nanometer scale and restrain the intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping.  Our results show that the spatial effect is crucial to further amplifying the electronic differences between organic and inorganic units for function enhancement. The combination of spatial and electronic effects will be useful in developing single&#8208;molecule semiconductor elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene Induced Perpetual Recovery on All Elemental Defects in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites always emerge complex interactions among different elemental ions, which lead to multiple intrinsic imperfections. Elemental defects, such as amine, Pb, and I vacancies at A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and X&#8208;sites, are main issues to deteriorate perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, most previous passivators can only temporarily fix partial inactive vacancies as sacrificial agents. Herein, we propose a recovery agent &#8208; ferrocene (Fc), which can form a one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with adequate steric cavities and suitable dissociation energy to recover all elemental defects back to active light&#8208;harvesting perovskites, and regenerate Fc itself meanwhile. Based on this perpetual chain&#8208;reaction cycle, corresponding PSCs maintain &gt;10,000&#8208;hour lifetime in inert condition and &gt;1,000&#8208;hour durabilities under various extreme environments, including continuous 85&#186;C heating, 50% relative humidity wetting, and 1&#8208;sun light soaking.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Nitrene by Silylenes without using a Reducing Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen incorporated R  1  LSi&#8208;N&#8592;SiLR  2  (  1  ) [L= PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ; R  1  = NTMS  2  , R  2  = NTMS]. Compound  1  is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8211;Si(I)L with 3.1 equivalents of Me  3  SiN  3  at low temperature to afford a triene&#8208;like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8211;Si(I)L with 2.1 equivalents of Me  3  SiN  3  at room temperature produced silaimine  2  with a central four&#8208;membered Si  2  N  2  ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment.  1  further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound  3  which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds  1  and  2  were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds  1  and  2  have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen incorporated R  1  LSi-N&#8592;SiLR  2  (  1  ) [L= PhC(N  t  Bu)  2  ; R  1  = NTMS  2  , R  2  = NTMS]. Compound  1  is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8211;Si(I)L with 3.1 equivalents of Me  3  SiN  3  at low temperature to afford a triene-like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8211;Si(I)L with 2.1 equivalents of Me  3  SiN  3  at room temperature produced silaimine  2  with a central four-membered Si  2  N  2  ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment.  1  further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound  3  which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds  1  and  2  were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds  1  and  2  have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Lego&#8208;like Construction of Modular and Asymmetric Baskets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise positioning of functional groups about the inner space of abiotic hosts is a challenging task and of interest for developing more effective receptors and catalysts akin to those found in nature. To address it, we herein report a synthetic methodology for preparing basket&#8208;like cavitands comprising of three different aromatics as side arms with orthogonal esters at the rim for further functionalization. First, enantioenriched  A  (borochloronorbornene),  B  (iodobromonorbornene) and  C  (boronorbornene) building blocks were obtained by stereoselective syntheses. Second, consecutive  A  &#8208;to&#8208;  B  and then  AB  &#8208;to&#8208;  C  SuzukiMiyaura (SM) couplings were optimized to give enantioenriched  ABC  cavitand as the principal product. The robust synthetic protocol allowed us to prepare (a) enantioenriched basket with three benzene sides and each holding either  t  &#8208;Bu, Et or Me esters, (b) both enantiomers of so&#8208;called &#8220;spiral staircase&#8221; basket with benzene, naphthalene and anthracene groups surrounding the inner space and (c) photo&#8208;responsive basket bearing one anthracene and two benzene arms.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into Iron(II) Bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;Bipyridine Skeleton for Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bis(pyridyl)amine&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;iron(II) framework (Fe(BPAbipy)) of complexes  1&#8208;3  is reported to shed light on the multistep nature of CO  2  reduction. Herein, photocatalytic conversion of CO  2  to CO even at low CO  2  concentration (1%), together with detailed mechanistic study and DFT calculations, reveal that  1  first undergoes two sequential one&#8208;electron transfer affording an intermediate with electron density on both Fe and ligand for CO  2  binding over proton. The following 2H  +  &#8208;assisted Fe&#8208;CO formation is rate&#8208;determining for selective CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction. A pendant, proton&#8208;shuttling &#945;&#8208;OH group (  2  ) initiates PCET for predominant H  2  evolution, while an &#945;&#8208;OMe group (  3  ) cancels the selectivity control for either CO or H  2  . The near&#8208;unity selectivity of  1  and  2  enables self&#8208;sorting syngas production at flexible CO/H  2  ratios. The unprecedented results from one kind of molecular catalyst skeleton encourage insight into the beauty of advanced multi&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;proton transfer processes for robust CO  2  RR by photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Recognition on Bare Gold Surface by Quartz Crystal Microbalance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is one of the powerful tools for the studies of molecular recognition and chiral discrimination. Its efficiency mainly relies on the design of the functional sensitive layer on the electrode surface. However, the organic sensitive layer may easily cause dissipation of oscillation or detachment and weaken the signal transfer during the molecular recognition processes. In this work, we reveal for the first time that the bare metal surface without the organic selector layer has the capability for chiral recognition in the QCM system. During the adsorption of various chiral amino acids, relatively higher selectivity of D&#8208;enantiomers on gold (Au) surface was shown by the QCM detection. Based on analyses of the surface crystalline structure and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the chiral nature of Au surface plays an important role in the selective binding of specific D&#8208;amino acids. These results may open new insights on chiral detection by QCM system. It will also promote the construction of novel chiral sensing systems with both efficient detection and separation capability.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unusual Conductivity of Na+ in PEO&#8208;Based Statistical Copolymers Solid Electrolytes: When Less Means More</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low conductivity of Na  +  electrolytes in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) curtails the development of Na polymer batteries. In this study, NaClO  4  (3&#8208;24 wt%, 90&#8208;9:1 O:Na) is dissolved in statistical copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) (0&#8208;20 mol%). Remarkably, the conductivity of these SPEs increases as the concentration of Na  +  decreases, thus departing from the usual Nernstian behaviour. Using a combination of calorimetric measurements and molecular dynamic simulations, this unusual phenomenon is attributed to the presence of physical cross&#8208;links generated by Na  +  . As a result, polymers containing a low salt concentration (3 wt%) display a drastically enhanced ionic conductivity (up to 0.2 10  &#8208;4  S/cm at 25&#176;C), thus paving the way for the design of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state PEO&#8208;based sodium batteries operational at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet&#8208;selective deposition of ultrathin Al2O3 on copper nanocrystals for highly stable CO2 electroreduction to ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalysts based on Cu nanocrystals (NCs) for electrochemical CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;C  2+  conversion with high activity have been a subject of considerable interest, but poor stability and low selectivity for a single C  2+  product remain obstacles for realizing sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral cycles. Here, we used the facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique to selectively cover the (111) surface of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al  2  O  3  to increase the exposed facet ratio of (100)/(111), resulting in a faradaic efficiency ratio of C  2  H  4  /CH  4  for overcoated Cu NCs 22 times higher than that for pure Cu NCs. Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al  2  O  3  &#8208;10C) reaches a C  2  H  4  faradaic efficiency of 60.4% at a current density of 300 mA cm  &#8208;2  in 5 M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell. Moreover, the Al  2  O  3  overcoating effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and the aggregation of Cu NCs, which explains the negligible activity loss and selectivity degradations of Cu NCs/Al  2  O  3  &#8208;10C shown in stability tests.</dc:description>

Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al  2  O  3  -10C) reaches a C  2  H  4  faradaic efficiency of 60.4% at a current density of 300 mA cm  -2  in 5 M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell. Moreover, the Al  2  O  3  overcoating effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and the aggregation of Cu NCs, which explains the negligible activity loss and selectivity degradations of Cu NCs/Al  2  O  3  -10C shown in stability tests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion&#160;by 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters.</title>

         <dc:description>Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;  C  &#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable for the first time the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above ~&#8208;30 &#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathodic electrodeposition of MOF films using hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films can be made by cathodic electrodeposition, where a Br&#248;nsted base is formed electrochemically which deprotonates the MOF linkers that are present in solution as undissociated/partially dissociated weak acids. However, the co&#8208;deposition of metal and the narrow range of possible metal nodes limit the scope of this method. In this work, we propose the use of hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide assisted cathodic deposition or HPACD), to overcome these limitations. Electrochemical measurements indicate that in DMF, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to superoxide anions that deprotonate the carboxylic ligands. This single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials than all previous reported methods. This prevents the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extends the range of possible metal nodes. Various pure MOF films (HKUST&#8208;1, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) and MOF&#8208;5) were prepared via this approach. HPACD was also used for the preparation of patterned MOF films and of flexible Cu&#8208;BTC coated paper membranes which rejects 99.1% of Rose Bengal from water with a permeance of 8.4 L m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  bar  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolite&#8208;tailored active site proximity, with well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm) confined within the internal cavities of zeolite&#8197;Y, significantly boosts the catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct hydrodeoxygenation of neat ethyl levulinate into pentanoic biofuels. Furthermore, La modification for zeolite&#8197;Y could improve the metal dispersion and the stability of zeolite during catalysis.







Abstract
Biofuel production can alleviate reliance on fossil resources and thus carbon dioxide emission. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite&#8197;Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot HDO of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. We have established and extended an understanding of the &#8220;intimacy criterion&#8221; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, leading to potential application for pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a TbIII&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of TbIII in Ln&#8208;MOFs led to turn&#8208;on sensing of organic analytes regardless of quenching oscillators. The presence of such a remote interaction mechanism during the turn&#8208;on sensing event was verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and molecular dynamic modelling investigations.







Abstract
Guided by a second&#8208;sphere interaction strategy, we fabricated a Tb(III)&#8208;based metal&#8212;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for turn&#8208;on sensing of methyl amine with ultra&#8208;low detection limit and high turn&#8208;on efficiency. MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with secondary coordination spheres that are densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Nonradiative routes were inhibited by binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand on the second coordination sphere, resulting in luminescence amplification. Such remote interacting mechanism involved in the turn&#8208;on sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb(III) enabled the first turn&#8208;on sensing of organic amines in aqueous conditions. Our work suggests a promising strategy for high&#8208;performance turn&#8208;on sensing for Ln&#8208;MOFs and luminous materials driven by other metal chromophores.

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>

A new class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF) is introduced. BCASF can serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of alkenylsulfonyl fluorides.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as cis alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds via Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21988-21996, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridged bicyclic nitrogen scaffolds are conformationally restricted analogues of important aminocarbo&#8208; and aminoheterocycles. Fixation of functional groups in a biologically active conformation provides efficient and selective ligands for various targets, featuring improved ADME parameters. Long synthetic sequences relying on traditional organic chemistry currently limit the drug discovery process. New step&#8208;economic synthetic procedures are therefore highly sought after.







Abstract
Bridged nitrogen bicyclic skeletons have been accessed via unprecedented site&#8208; and diastereoselective orthogonal tandem catalysis from readily accessible reactants in a step economic manner. Directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination of aminocyclohexane with gem&#8208;dibromoalkenes, followed by a consecutive intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed amidation of the 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;alkenylated product delivers the interesting normorphan skeleton. The tandem protocol can be applied on substituted aminocyclohexanes and aminoheterocycles, easily providing access to the corresponding substituted, aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;analogues. The Cu catalyst of the Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction additionally avoids off&#8208;cycle Pd catalyst scavenging by alkenylated reaction product. The picolinamide directing group stabilizes the enamine of the 7&#8208;alkylidenenormorphan, allowing further product post functionalizations. Without Cu catalyst, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination is achieved.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorogenic Probe for Monitoring Ethylene in Living Cells and Plants</title>

Fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic probes were developed for rapid (&lt;2&#8197;min), highly selective, and quantitative detection of ethylene. Among the coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes developed, CEP&#8208;1 has the capacity to detect endogenous ethylene gas in living cells and plants.







Abstract
Ethylene (ET) is an important gaseous plant hormone. It is highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes for monitoring ethylene in living cells. We report an efficient RhIII&#8208;catalysed coupling of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides to ethylene in the presence of an alcohol. The newly discovered coupling reaction exhibited a wide scope of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides and excellent regioselectivity. We successfully developed three fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes (CEPs) using this strategy for the selective and quantitative detection of ethylene. CEP&#8208;1 exhibited the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of ethylene at 52&#8197;ppb in air. Furthermore, CEP&#8208;1 was successfully applied for imaging in living CHO&#8208;K1 cells and for monitoring endogenous&#8208;induced changes in ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These results indicate that CEP&#8208;1 has great potential to illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction in living biological systems.

         <title>Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction on Metal Surfaces</title>

An illustration of selectivity and activity on metals for nitric oxide reduction reaction is presented. Both selectivity and activity of NO reduction has been indicated by *N adsorption energy. There is a very little window to find both selective and active catalyst for the NO reduction in the volcano.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic denitrification is a promising technology for removing NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722; and NO). For NOx electroreduction (NOxRR), there is a desire for understanding the catalytic parameters that control the product distribution. Here, we elucidate selectivity and activity of catalyst for NOxRR. At low potential we classify metals by the binding of *NO versus *H. Analogous to classifying CO2 reduction by *CO vs. *H, Cu is able to bind *NO while not binding *H giving rise to a selective NH3 formation. Besides being selective, Cu is active for the reaction found by an activity&#8208;volcano. For metals that does not bind NO the reaction stops at NO, similar to CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. At potential above 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, we speculate a low barrier for N coupling with NO causing N2O formation. The work provides a clear strategy for selectivity and aims to inspire future research on NOxRR.

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>

Measured resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) often did not agree with theoretical predictions. We uncover a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, that explains some of these inconsistencies. This combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman has also immense potential as a sensitive technique for applications in chemistry or biology.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light, IR&#8722;IL, when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by eCP&#8208;Raman, without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of eCP&#8208;Raman spectroscopy and for extracting true RROA experimentally.

         <title>Stabilizing Transition Metal Vacancy Induced Oxygen Redox by Co2+/Co3+ Redox and Sodium&#8208;Site Doping for Layered Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22026-22034, September 27, 2021. </description>

A P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: transition metal (TM) vacancy) cathode material is designed that contains vacancies and Co2+ in TM sites, and Mg2+ in both TM and Na sites. The synergic effect of low&#8208;valence Co2+/Co3+ redox and Mg2+ in sodium sites stabilizes the structure of this cathode material significantly during cycling.







Abstract
Anionic redox is an effective way to boost the energy density of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries. However, inherent rigid nature of the TMO6 (TM: transition metals) subunits in the layered materials makes it hardly tolerate the inner strains induced by lattice glide, especially at high voltage. Herein, P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: TM vacancy) is designed that contains vacancies in TM sites, and Mg ions in both TM and sodium sites. Vacancies make the rigid TMO6 octahedron become more asymmetric and flexible. Low valence Co2+/Co3+ redox couple stabilizes the electronic structure, especially at the charged state.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anionic redox is an effective way to boost the energy density of layer-structured metal-oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries. However, inherent rigid nature of the TMO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (TM: transition metals) subunits in the layered materials makes it hardly tolerate the inner strains induced by lattice glide, especially at high voltage. Herein, P2-Na&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;[Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.07&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#9633;: TM vacancy) is designed that contains vacancies in TM sites, and Mg ions in both TM and sodium sites. Vacancies make the rigid TMO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron become more asymmetric and flexible. Low valence Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; redox couple stabilizes the electronic structure, especially at the charged state. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in sodium sites can tune the interlayer spacing against O-O electrostatic repulsion. Time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction confirms that irreversible structure evolution is effectively suppressed during deep desodiation benefiting from the specific configuration. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that, deriving from the intrinsic vacancies, multiple local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;-O-&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na-O-&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Mg-O-&#9633;&#8221; are superior in facilitating the oxygen redox for charge compensation than previously reported &#8220;Na-O-Mg&#8221;.

         <title>Exporting Metal&#8208;Carbene Chemistry to Live Mammalian Cells: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intracellular Synthesis of Quinoxalines Enabled by N&#8722;H Carbene Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22017-22025, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that catalytic processes involving metal&#8211;carbene intermediates can be exported to the crowded magma of a live mammalian cell. In particular, reactions involving copper carbenes can be used for the synthesis of fluorescent cyclic products in cellular media, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8722;H carbene insertion. The method also allows the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions.







Abstract
Implementing catalytic organometallic transformations in living settings can offer unprecedented opportunities in chemical biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the number of biocompatible reactions so far discovered is very limited, and essentially restricted to uncaging processes. Here, we demonstrate the viability of performing metal carbene transfer reactions in live mammalian cells. In particular, we show that copper (II) catalysts can promote the intracellular annulation of alpha&#8208;keto diazocarbenes with ortho&#8208;amino arylamines, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8208;H carbene insertion. The potential of this transformation is underscored by the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions, and by demonstrating cell selective biological responses using targeted copper catalysts. Considering the wide reactivity spectrum of metal carbenes, this work opens the door to significantly expanding the repertoire of life&#8208;compatible abiotic reactions.

         <title>Brightening up Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Monosubstituted Polyacetylene by Conformation Control: Mechanism, Switching, and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21918-21926, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is described that enables the conventionally non&#8208;luminescent monosubstituted polyacetylenes bearing no pendant fluorophore to light up and show a switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a large dissymmetric factor (glum, 10&#8722;1), multiple reversible stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and quantitative detection by conformational transition of polyene backbone.







Abstract
The first example of luminescent monosubstituted polyacetylenes (mono&#8208;PAs) is presented, based on a contracted cis&#8208;cisoid polyene backbone. It has an excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance with a high dissymmetric factor (up to the order of 10&#8722;1). The luminescence stems from the helical cis&#8208;cisoid PA backbone, which is tightly fixed by the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby reversing the energy order of excited states and enabling an emissive energy dissipation. CPL switches are facilely achieved by the solvent and temperature through reversible conformational transition. By taking advantages of fast response and high sensitivity, the thin film of mono&#8208;PAs could be used as a CPL&#8208;based probe for quantitative detection of trifluoroacetic acid with a wider linear dynamic range than those of photoluminescence and circular dichroism. This work opens a new avenue to develop novel smart CPL materials through modulating conformational transition.

         <title>Quick and Easy Method to Dramatically Improve the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22070-22074, September 27, 2021. </description>

The electrochemical CO2 reduction activity of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, is dramatically enhanced by a simple one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction. The resulting complex, FeTPP, shows improved solubility. Its turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile is 7.3&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of relevant molecular catalysts.







Abstract
The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO2 reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7&#8201;300&#8201;000&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated FeI species and CO2 in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Chemical Genetics Reveals a Role of Squalene Synthase in TGF&#946; Signaling and Cardiomyogenesis</title>

KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis. Chemical genetics of KY02111 identified squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling and recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes an inherited heart disease.







Abstract
KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis of the mesoderm cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version, KY&#8208;I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.

The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version, KY-I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER-membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Saucer[n]arenes: Synthesis, Structure, Complexation, and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence Property</title>

Starting from 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes named saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) are synthesized by one&#8208;pot and templated methods. Saucer[n]arenes show strong fluorescence properties and form 1:1 complexes with various ammonium salts. Moreover, the chiral guests can induce the chirality of dynamically racemic saucer[n]arenes in the host&#8211;guest systems, which provides a new way to construct CPL organic materials.







Abstract
Macrocycles denoted as saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) were easily synthesized by the one&#8208;pot condensation of 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene (2,7&#8208;DMN) and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TFA or catalytic BF3&#8901;OEt2. With 1,1&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ium as the template, saucer[4]arene was selectively obtained. Crystal structures show that saucer[n]arenes are all composed of 2,7&#8208;DMN moiety bridged by the methylene groups at 1,6&#8208;positions: all of the 7&#8208;methoxy groups lie on one face, and all of the 2&#8208;methoxy groups lie on the other. Saucer[n]arenes exhibit strong fluorescence properties with the quantum yields of 19.6&#8201;% and 23.4&#8201;%. They form 1:1 complexes with ammonium salts in both solution and solid state (association constant up to 105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CDCl3). Chiral quaternary ammonium salts can induce the chirality of the dynamically racemic inherently chiral saucer[n]arenes in solution, and thus show mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.

         <title>Contrasting E&#8722;H Bond Activation Pathways of a Phosphanyl&#8208;Phosphagallene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22057-22061, September 27, 2021. </description>

We describe the synthesis and reactivity of a phosphanyl phosphagallene towards reagents with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds. These studies reveal that there are two competing reactivity pathways available for such bond activation reactions: a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism, and a competing pathway which results in the hydroelementation of the Ga=P double bond.







Abstract
The reactivity of the phosphanyl&#8208;phosphagallene, [H2C{N(Dipp)}]2PP=Ga(Nacnac) (Nacnac=HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) towards a series of reagents possessing E&#8722;H bonds (primary amines, ammonia, water, phenylacetylene, phenylphosphine, and phenylsilane) is reported. Two contrasting reaction pathways are observed, determined by the polarity of the E&#8722;H bonds of the substrates. In the case of protic reagents (&#948;&#8722;E&#8722;H&#948;+), a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism is operational at room temperature, in which the gallium metal centre acts as a Lewis acid and the pendant phosphanyl moiety deprotonates the substrates. Interestingly, at elevated temperatures both NH2iPr and ammonia can react via a second, higher energy, pathway resulting in the hydroamination of the Ga=P bond. By contrast, with hydridic reagents (&#948;+E&#8722;H&#948;&#8722;), such as phenylsilane, hydroelementation of the Ga=P bond is exclusively observed, in line with the polarisation of the Si&#8722;H and Ga=P bonds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Radical Hydro&#8208; and Aminooxygenation of Unactivated Alkenes Tuned by Ketoxime Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21997-22003, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable protocol for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated olefins under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been developed. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated N&#8722;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates, followed by an oxygen&#8208;centered radical addition.







Abstract
A tunable photocatalytic method is reported for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated alkenes using readily accessible ketoxime carbonates as the diverse functionalization reagents. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;promoted N&#8722;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates leading to alkoxylcarbonyloxyl and iminyl radicals under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, followed by the addition of alkoxylcarbonyloxyl radical to alkenes. By taking advantage of the different stability of the iminyl radicals, the generated carbon radical either abstracts a hydrogen atom from the media to form the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrooxygenation product, or it is trapped by the persistent iminyl radical to furnish the aminooxygenation product. Notably, this is the first example of direct hydrooxygenation of unactivated olefins with anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity involving an oxygen&#8208;centered radical.

         <title>Intermetallic FePt@PtBi Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21899-21904, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermetallic FePt@PtBi electrocatalyst with a L10&#8208;FePt core and a PtBi shell shows excellent ORR performance and stability, which are attributed to superimposed strain. Even after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, the activity of the FePt@PtBi electrocatalyst is still as high as 0.79&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1, comfortably exceeding the DOE 2020 targets. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows a better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than benchmark Pt/C.







Abstract
The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. An effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Herein, we show a general surface&#8208;engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating with alloy PtBi shells. FePt@PtBi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles showed the best ORR performance with a mass activity of 0.96&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and a specific activity of 2.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively 7&#8197;times and 11&#8197;times those of the corresponding values for benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows much better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than conventional Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The observed comprehensive enhancement in ORR performance of FePt@PtBi can be attributed to the increased compressive strain of the Pt surface due to in&#8208;plane shearing resulting from the presence of the large Bi atoms in the surface&#8208;structured PtBi overlayers, as well as charge displacement via Pt&#8208;Bi bonding which mitigates crossover issues.

Novel responsive nanoparticles based on Cerenkov resonance energy transfer are suitable for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of deep tumors without the need for exogenous light. The nanoparticles have low toxicity and few harmful side effects on normal tissue.







Abstract
Stimulating photosensitizers (PS) by Cerenkov radiation (CR) can overcome the light penetration limitation in traditional photodynamic therapy. However, separate injection of radiopharmaceuticals and PS cannot guarantee their efficient interaction in tumor areas, while co&#8208;delivery of radionuclides and PS face the problem of nonnegligible phototoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we describe a 131I&#8208;labeled smart photosensitizer, composed of pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (photosensitizer), a diisopropylamino group (pH&#8208;sensitive group), an 131I&#8208;labeled tyrosine group (CR donor), and polyethylene glycol, which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (131I&#8208;sPS NPs). The 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed low phototoxicity in normal tissues due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, but could self&#8208;produce reactive oxygen species in tumor sites upon disassembly. Upon intravenous injection, 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed great tumor inhibition capability in subcutaneous 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing Balb/c mice and orthotopic VX2 liver tumor bearing rabbits. We believed 131I&#8208;sPS NPs could expand the application of CR and provide an effective strategy for deep tumor theranostics.

         <title>Intrinsic ORR Activity Enhancement of Pt Atomic Sites by Engineering the d&#8208;Band Center via Local Coordination Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21911-21917, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;coordinated atomic Pt&#8208;Nx sites are theoretically predicted and experimentally realized, offering enhanced kinetics for four&#8208;electron electrochemical oxygen reduction. Exceptional activity is attributed to the tuning of the d&#8208;band electron center via local coordination asymmetry. This chemistry provides an effective guideline for atomic Pt catalysts in batteries and fuel cells.







Abstract
A considerable amount of platinum (Pt) is required to ensure an adequate rate for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the Pt content. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co&#8208;coordination on a carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the d&#8208;band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. PtNPC with a record&#8208;low Pt content (&#8776;0.026&#8197;wt&#8201;%) consequently shows a benchmark&#8208;comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 VRHE and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 VRHE. It also features a high stability in 15&#8201;000&#8208;cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.9 VRHE. Damjanovic kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from a mixed 2/4&#8208;electron to a predominately 4&#8208;electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts d&#8208;band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.

         <title>Grotthuss Proton&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21838-21845, September 27, 2021. </description>

Two highly crystalline, robust covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were fabricated with intrinsic Grotthuss proton conductivity. The assembled covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based pseudocapacitors displayed both high energy density and high power density that surpassed that of all other reported COF&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the synthesis of two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that display intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox&#8208;active azo groups in the COFs can undergo a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making the COFs ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in situ hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three&#8208;electrode specific capacitance of 440&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, among the highest for COF&#8208;based supercapacitors, and can retain 90&#8201;% capacitance even after 10&#8201;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. This is the first example using Grotthuss proton&#8208;conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two&#8208;electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a maximum power density of 42&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, surpassing that of all reported COF&#8208;based systems.

By integration of the endocytotic process and the overexpressing enzyme within lysosome in cancer cells, we construct enzymatic programmable assemblies selectively in living cancer cells for glioblastoma cancer therapy.







Abstract
Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Triggered Intracellular H+ Transients for Lamellipodia&#8208;Collapsed Antimetastasis and Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21905-21910, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR&#8208;activated H+ release strategy based on UMP NPs successfully achieves lamellipodia&#8208;collapsed antimetastasis and enhanced chemodynamic therapy. This metastasis&#8208;oriented anticancer strategy may offer a new option for tumor antimetastasis and tumor treatment in the field of nanomedicines.







Abstract
In solid tumors, tumor invasion and metastasis account for 90&#8201;% of cancer&#8208;related deaths. Cell migration is steered by the lamellipodia formed at the leading edge. These lamellipodia can drive the cell body forward by its mechanical deformation regulated by cofilin. Inhibiting cofilin activity can cause significant defects in directional lamellipodia formation and the locomotory capacity of cell invasion, thus contributing to antimetastatic treatment. Herein, a near infrared light (NIR)&#8208;controlled nanoscale proton supplier was designed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a core coated in MIL&#8208;88B for interior photoacids loading; this photoacids loading can boost H+ transients in cells, which converts the cofilin to an inactive form. Strikingly, inactive cofilin loses the ability to mediate lamellipodia deformation for cell migration. Additionally, the iron, which serves as a catalyticaly active center in MIL&#8208;88B, initiates an enhanced Fenton reaction due to the increased H+ in the tumor, ultimately achieving intensive chemodynamic therapy (CDT).

     alt="NIR-Triggered Intracellular H+ Transients for Lamellipodia-Collapsed Antimetastasis and Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NIR-activated H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; release strategy based on UMP NPs successfully achieves lamellipodia-collapsed antimetastasis and enhanced chemodynamic therapy. This metastasis-oriented anticancer strategy may offer a new option for tumor antimetastasis and tumor treatment in the field of nanomedicines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In solid tumors, tumor invasion and metastasis account for 90&#8201;% of cancer-related deaths. Cell migration is steered by the lamellipodia formed at the leading edge. These lamellipodia can drive the cell body forward by its mechanical deformation regulated by cofilin. Inhibiting cofilin activity can cause significant defects in directional lamellipodia formation and the locomotory capacity of cell invasion, thus contributing to antimetastatic treatment. Herein, a near infrared light (NIR)-controlled nanoscale proton supplier was designed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a core coated in MIL-88B for interior photoacids loading; this photoacids loading can boost H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in cells, which converts the cofilin to an inactive form. Strikingly, inactive cofilin loses the ability to mediate lamellipodia deformation for cell migration. Additionally, the iron, which serves as a catalyticaly active center in MIL-88B, initiates an enhanced Fenton reaction due to the increased H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the tumor, ultimately achieving intensive chemodynamic therapy (CDT). This work provides new insight into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in cells, which not only regulates cofilin protonation for antimetastatic treatment but also improves chemodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;Bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>

Uniform polymer nanoparticles were constructed by green emulsion polymerization, overcoming the disadvantage of large &#960;&#8208;bond conjugation while keeping many triple bonds to realize stimulated Raman scattering imaging. 15 distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations were achieved by Raman shift/intensity encoding in the biological silence region (1800&#8211;2800&#8197;cm&#8722;1), thus providing a tool for high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial fingerprint output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.

         <title>Resolution of Lithium Deposition versus Intercalation of Graphite Anodes in Lithium Ion Batteries: An In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study</title>

         <dc:description>
An in situ EPR cell with a well&#8208;defined electrochemical response is designed to understand the lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode of the Li&#8208;ion battery. Li deposition on the graphite electrode occurs at +0.04&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 0.04&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. The safe cut&#8208;off potential limit for the anode during high rate cycling and inhibition of Li deposition by a vinylene carbonate additive are revealed by in situ EPR.







Abstract
In situ electrochemical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior on graphite anodes during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation, and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density, and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Classical over&#8208;charging (normally associated with potentials &#8804;0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate is lowered to 0.04&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. The inhibition of Li deposition by vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer with higher ionic conductivity. A safe cut&#8208;off potential limit of +0.05&#8197;V for the anode is suggested for high rate cycling, confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22062-22069, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy to trigger charge transfer for improving photosensitization is the covalent modification of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Charge transfer from the PAH donor to the Bodipy acceptor in CMPs can facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8211;hole separation, leading to excellent performance for both energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer reactions.







Abstract
Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92&#8201;% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32&#8201;%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.

However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy-atom-free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers.

Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for cocaine&#8208;induced long&#8208;term toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. We computationally identified, re&#8208;designed, and crystallized a novel BZEase. The obtained BZEase mutant shows a 427&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency toward BZE compared to WT BZEase. In vivo tests prove that the BZEase mutant is a promising treatment for BZE detoxification.







Abstract
Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE. In vivo, a single dose of BZEase2 (1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme has the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was also determined.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nanobodies Allow Dual&#8208;Color Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy in Untransfected Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22075-22080, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;permeable nanobodies equipped with a fluorophore and a photostabilizer are introduced as powerful tools for live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By using intramolecular photostabilization dynamic processes can be monitored in untransfected living cells.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy in living cells can be restricted by the availability of small molecule probes, which only exist against few targets and genetically encoded tags. Here, we expand the applicability of live&#8208;cell STED by engineering cell&#8208;permeable and highly fluorescent nanobodies as intracellular targeting agents. To ensure bright fluorescent signals at low concentrations we used the concept of intramolecular photostabilization by ligating a fluorophore along with the photostabilizer trolox to the nanobody using expressed protein ligation (EPL). Furthermore, these semi&#8208;synthetic nanobodies are equipped with a cleavable cell&#8208;penetrating peptide for efficient cellular entry, which enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP and mCherry, as well as two endogenous targets, nuclear lamins and the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA. We monitored cell division and DNA replication via confocal and STED microscopy thus demonstrating the utility of these new intracellular tools for functional analysis.

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Heterostructured SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 with High&#8208;Valence Mn3+/4+ for Improved Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22043-22050, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An epitaxially grown SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 heterostructure has been developed for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the effect of interfacial chemistry on ORR performance, the formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial in promoting the positive shift of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and improving catalytic activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured catalysts show outstanding performance in electrochemical reactions owing to their beneficial interfacial properties. However, the rational design of heterostructured catalysts with the desired interfacial properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics is challenging. Herein, we developed a SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 (SMOx&#8208;SMO) heterostructure through epitaxial growth, which demonstrated excellent electrocatalyst performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial for promoting a positive shift in the position of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and resulting in improved catalytic activity. When SMOx&#8208;SMO was applied as an air&#8208;electrode catalyst in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, a high output voltage and power density was achieved, with performance comparable to a battery prepared with Pt/C&#8208;IrO2 air&#8208;electrode catalysts, albeit with much better cycling stability.

         <title>Direct Amidation of Esters by Ball Milling**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21868-21874, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling enabled the direct amidation of esters through simple coupling under basic conditions (see scheme). A wide range of esters underwent amidation by this method with an array of primary and secondary amides without the need for a bulk solvent, catalysts, or additives.







Abstract
The direct mechanochemical amidation of esters by ball milling is described. The operationally simple procedure requires an ester, an amine, and substoichiometric KOtBu and was used to prepare a large and diverse library of 78 amide structures with modest to excellent efficiency. Heteroaromatic and heterocyclic components are specifically shown to be amenable to this mechanochemical protocol. This direct synthesis platform has been applied to the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and agrochemicals as well as the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of an active pharmaceutical, all in the absence of a reaction solvent.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Methanol through Atomically Dispersed Sn Coupled with Defective CuO Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21979-21987, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared atomically dispersed Sn catalysts on defective CuO for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. The Faradaic efficiency of methanol could reach 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The catalyst was beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The *CO was then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.







Abstract
Using renewable electricity to drive CO2 electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO2 reduction. Currently, CO2 electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO2 adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.

         <title>An Element&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutadiene Exhibiting High&#8208;Energy Blue Phosphorescence</title>

We report the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity and photophysical properties of a planar cyclic 4&#960; system, based on studies on a diazadiboretidine derivative, an isoelectronic heterocyclic analogue of cyclobutadiene. Diazadiboretidine, despite having the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels, displays blue phosphorescence, rather than thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
1,3,2,4&#8208;Diazadiboretidine, an isoelectronic heteroanalogue of cyclobutadiene, is an interesting chemical species in terms of comparison with the carbon system, whereas its properties have never been investigated experimentally. According to Baird's rule, H&#252;ckel antiaromatic cyclobutadiene acquires aromaticity in the lowest triplet state. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies on the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity/aromaticity as well as the photophysical properties of an isolable 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidine derivative. The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B2N2 ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B2N2 ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence.

The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chalcogen (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) phenyl and aryl functionalised anion receptors exhibit a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Variation of electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating properties of triazole appended&#8208; or directly Te&#8208;bound&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituents facilitated linear free energy relationship (LFER) Hammett plot analysis revealing electronic modulation of halide anion selectivity in sigma&#8208;hole anion receptor design.







Abstract
A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro&#8208; or iodo&#8208; donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma&#8208;hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty&#8208;fold and eight&#8208;fold increase in chloride anion affinity, respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (3&#8901;ChB), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the Te&#8208;bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine&#8208;tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB&#8208;based receptor systems.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Glycine from Oxalic Acid and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21943-21951, September 27, 2021. </description>

By electrochemical method, stable oxalic acid and nitrate substrates were coupled into an amino acid, glycine. Insertion of electrons resulted in their conversion into nucleophile and electrophile, respectively, which led to C=N bond formation between them, as well as the conversion of the reversible C=N double bond to a stable C&#8722;N single bond.







Abstract
In manufacturing C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing compounds, it is an important challenge to alternate the conventional methodologies that utilize reactive substrates, toxic reagents, and organic solvents. In this study, we developed an electrochemical method to synthesize a C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing molecule avoiding the use of cyanides and amines by harnessing nitrate (NO3&#8722;) as a nitrogen source in an aqueous electrolyte. In addition, we utilized oxalic acid as a carbon source, which can be obtained from electrochemical conversion of CO2. Thus, our approach can provide a route for the utilization of anthropogenic CO2 and nitrate wastes, which cause serious environmental problems including global warming and eutrophication. Interestingly, the coreduction of oxalic acid and nitrate generated reactive intermediates, which led to C&#8722;N bond formation followed by further reduction to an amino acid, namely, glycine. By carefully controlling this multireduction process with a fabricated Cu&#8211;Hg electrode, we demonstrated the efficient production of glycine with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of up to 43.1&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density&#8776;90&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Identification of a Bromodomain&#8208;like Region in 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 Explains Its Nuclear Localization</title>

Activity&#8208;based labeling of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity using the novel one&#8208;step labeling probe Labelox B enables detection of isoenzyme inhibitory selectivity in an ELISA&#8208;based assay and visualization of the localization of LOX activity in living cells. The observed nuclear localization was rationalized by identification of a bromodomain&#8208;like region in the 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 isoenzyme.







Abstract
Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity provides oxidative lipid metabolites, which are involved in inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. Activity&#8208;based probes to detect the activity of LOX enzymes in their cellular context provide opportunities to explore LOX biology and LOX inhibition. Here, we developed Labelox B as a potent covalent LOX inhibitor for one&#8208;step activity&#8208;based labeling of proteins with LOX activity. Labelox B was used to establish an ELISA&#8208;based assay for affinity capture and antibody&#8208;based detection of specific LOX isoenzymes. Moreover, Labelox B enabled efficient activity&#8208;based labeling of endogenous LOXs in living cells. LOX proved to localize in the nucleus, which was rationalized by identification of a functional bromodomain&#8208;like consensus motif in 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1. This indicates that 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 is not only involved in oxidative lipid metabolism, but also in chromatin binding, which suggests a potential role in chromatin modifications.

         <title>Integrating Hydrogen Production and Transfer Hydrogenation with Selenite Promoted Electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;Nitrotoluenes to E&#8208;Nitroethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22010-22016, September 27, 2021. </description>

Selective electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluenes to carbon&#8208;added E&#8208;nitroethenes with wide substrate scope, high selectivity, and Faradaic efficiency is integrated with boosting H2 production or transfer hydrogenation over a bifunctional NiSe electrode. In situ formed hypervalent Ni&#948;+, surface adsorbed SeOx2&#8722;, and &#8722;NO2 adsorption of intermediate promote aqueous electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene to E&#8208;nitroethene.







Abstract
Developing an electrochemical carbon&#8208;added reaction with accelerated kinetics to replace the low&#8208;value and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is markedly significant to pure hydrogen production. Regulating the critical steps to precisely design electrode materials to selectively synthesize targeted compounds is highly desirable. Here, inspired by the surfaced adsorbed SeOx2&#8722; promoting OER, NiSe is demonstrated to be an efficient anode enabling &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene electrooxidation to E&#8208;nitroethene with up to 99&#8201;% E selectivity, 89&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, and the reaction rate of 0.25&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 via inhibiting side reactions for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen generation. The high performance can be associated with its in situ formed NiOOH surface layer and absorbed SeOx2&#8722; via Se leaching&#8208;oxidation during electrooxidation, and the preferential adsorption of two &#8208;NO2 groups of intermediate on NiOOH. A self&#8208;coupling of &#945;&#8208;carbon radicals and subsequent elimination of a nitrite molecule pathway is proposed. Wide substrate scope, scale&#8208;up synthesis of E&#8208;nitroethene, and paired productions of E&#8208;nitroethene and hydrogen or N&#8208;protected aminoarenes over a bifunctional NiSe electrode highlight the promising potential. Gold also displays a similar promoting effect for &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene transformation like SeOx2&#8722;, rationalizing the strategy of designing materials to suppress side reactions.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Heteroacenes that Contain Two Boron Atoms: Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Based on a Push&#8211;Pull Effect**

Push&#8211;pull modification of acene scaffolds by incorporation of two electron&#8208;accepting boron atoms and two electron&#8208;donating planarized phenyl ether moieties renders the resulting compounds near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active. Of particular note is a thienothiophene&#8208;centered 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused diboraheteroacene that exhibits a sharp NIR emission band with a narrow band width.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient heteroacenes that contain two tricoordinate boron atoms in their acene skeletons and planarized phenyl ether moieties at their periphery were synthesized via the borylation of silicon&#8208;bridged precursors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed quinoidal structures, which give rise to two&#8208;step reversible redox processes for both the reduction and oxidation. These compounds exhibit intense absorption and sharp fluorescence bands with vibronic structures in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. These properties originate from the push&#8211;pull effect along the long axis of the molecule derived from the electron&#8208;donating ether moieties and the electron&#8208;accepting boron moieties. Of particular note is the NIR emission of the thienothiophene&#8208;centered heteroacene, which has a maximum at 952&#8197;nm with a narrow band width of 309&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in cyclohexane. A Franck&#8211;Condon analysis revealed the crucial role of the sterically less&#8208;hindered thienothiophene spacer in achieving this sharp emission band.

         <title>Implanting Numerous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a Cu&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Nanosheet to Boost CH4 Selectivity in Neutral&#8208;Media CO2 Electroreduction</title>

A Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale, ultrathin nanosheet with numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks was developed for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 under neutral conditions. This catalyst exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell.







Abstract
The exploration of novel systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the production of hydrocarbons like CH4 remains a giant challenge. Well&#8208;designed electrocatalysts with advantages like proton generation/transferring and intermediate&#8208;fixating for efficient CO2RR are much preferred yet largely unexplored. In this work, a kind of Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale (&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin nanosheet (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) has been successfully applied in electrochemical CO2RR. It exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell. The high performance can be attributed to the construction of numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through the integration of diaminotriazine with Cu&#8208;porphyrin, which is beneficial for proton migration and intermediate stabilization, as supported by DFT calculations. This work paves a new way in exploring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based materials as efficient CO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Chiral Distorted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes Bearing a Nonagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22051-22056, September 27, 2021. </description>

The larger the ring, the better the chiroptical properties: A new family of highly distorted nanographenes is presented incorporating for the first time a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle. The nonagon&#8208;containing [5]helicene results in an extremely twisted helical moiety and provides the final chiral PAHs with enhanced chiroptical properties.







Abstract
A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs|=4.2&#215;10&#8722;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emissive Carbon Dots Gels for Octopus&#8208;Inspired Shape/Color Synergistically Adjustable Actuators</title>

Carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable symmetric surfaces were used to develop aggregation&#8208;induced emissive CD polymer gels with reversible two&#8208;switch&#8208;mode fluorescence (blue dispersed fluorescence and red AIE), followed by the fabrication of anisotropic swimming robots showing octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and autonomous locomotion on the water surface.







Abstract
Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.

         <title>Selective Electrosynthetic Hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters with Carbon Dioxide**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrosynthetic hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated olefins with excellent regioselectivity is reported. The method requires no sacrificial electrode and is thus amenable to a flow configuration. The products are purified by simple crystallization. The synthesis of a precursor to ethosuximide, which contains an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, illustrates the potential of the process. Finally, a robustness study has benchmarked the process for future users.







Abstract
The carboxylation of low&#8208;value commodity chemicals to provide higher&#8208;value carboxylic acids is of significant interest. Recently alternative routes to the traditional hydroformylation processes that used potentially toxic carbon monoxide and a transition metal catalyst have appeared. A significant challenge has been the selectivity observed for olefin carboxylation. Photochemical methods have shown a viable route towards the hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes but rely on the use of an excess reducing or amine reagent. Herein we report our investigations of an electrochemical approach that is able to hydrocarboxylate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes with excellent regioselectivity and the ability to carboxylate hindered substrates to afford &#945;&#8208;quaternary center carboxylic acids. The reported process requires no chromatography and the products are purified by simple crystallization from the reaction mixture after work&#8208;up.

The ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state properties of a diazadiboretidine (DADBT) derivative, an isoelectronic heterocyclic analogue of cyclobutadiene, are reported by Henrik Ottosson, Hiromi Nakai, Tadaaki Ikoma, Takanori Fukushima, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21817. While the B2N2 ring of the DADBT derivative adopts a rhombic geometry in the ground state, it turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the DADBT derivative displays blue phosphorescence in solution, providing insight into the photophysical properties of heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;systems.

An effective strategy to endow an acene skeleton with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission properties is reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21853. The incorporation of boron and oxygen atoms furnishes a push&#8211;pull structure along the periphery of the acene skeleton. In particular, a thienothiophene&#8208;based diboraheteroacene exhibits a sharp NIR emission band with a narrow band width.

Escape from flatland. Increased saturation (fraction of sp3) is more likely to be successful when moving compounds through the drug development pipeline. Bridged nitrogen heterocycles have a huge potential in drug discovery, although long synthetic sequences are typically required. New step&#8208;economic and selective organic syntheses are therefore highly sought after. Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article on page&#8197;21988 the synthesis of the normorphan skeleton through challenging tandem catalysis. Cover design by Joris Snaet.

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Carbanions through Carbonyl Umpolung</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21624-21634, September 27, 2021. </description>

Novel catalytic strategies for the generation of functionalized carbanionic species by carbonyl Umpolung are discussed in this Minireview. The application of metal catalysis and photocatalysis significantly facilitates the generation and conversion of carbanionic intermediates starting from carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Carbonyl Umpolung is a powerful strategy in organic chemistry to construct complex molecules. Over the last few years, versatile catalytic approaches for the generation of acyl anion equivalents from carbonyl compounds have been developed, but methods to obtain alkyl carbanions from carbonyl compounds in a catalytic fashion are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the generation of alkyl carbanions through catalytic carbonyl Umpolung. Two different catalytic approaches can be utilized to enable the generation of alkyl carbanions from carbonyl compounds: the catalytic Wolff&#8211;Kishner reaction and the catalytic single&#8208;electron reduction of carbonyl compounds and imines. We discuss the reaction scope, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of the methods as well as potential future developments.

         <title>Defect Passivation in Lead&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals and Thin Films: Toward Efficient LEDs and Solar Cells</title>

Despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of lead&#8208;halide perovskites, defects at the surface of colloidal nanocrystals and grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and nonradiative recombination, which lowers the photoluminescence quantum yields, device efficiency, and stability. This Review summarizes the defects, their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties, and passivation strategies to mitigate the effects of defects.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs), in the form of both colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) and thin films, have emerged over the past decade as leading candidates for next&#8208;generation, efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells. Owing to their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), LHPs efficiently convert injected charge carriers into light and vice versa. However, despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of LHPs, defects at the surface of colloidal NCs and grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and nonradiative recombination, which lowers the PLQYs, device efficiency, and stability. Therefore, understanding the defects that play a key role in limiting performance, and developing effective passivation routes are critical for achieving advances in performance. This Review presents the current understanding of defects in halide perovskites and their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Passivation strategies toward improving the efficiencies of perovskite&#8208;based LEDs and solar cells are also discussed.

         <title>The First High&#8208;Pressure Chromium Oxonitridoborate CrB4O6N&#8212;an Unexpected Link to Nitridosilicate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21801-21806, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature approach, CrB4O6N could be obtained as the first oxonitridoborate containing BO3N tetrahedra and building up a 3D framework. In contrast to other members of this substance class, the nitrogen atoms connect four boron atoms. Homeotypes can be found in the nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M=Sr, Ba, Eu), which were the first to feature this fourfold connected nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
CrB4O6N crystallizes in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (no. 186) with the lattice parameters a=5.1036(1), c=8.3519(3)&#8197;&#197;, and a volume of 188.40(1)&#8197;&#197;3. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature experiment at 7&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K and represents the first high&#8208;pressure oxonitridoborate. It is built up of starlike&#8208;shaped entities of four BO3N tetrahedra, connected via one common nitrogen atom that resembles the fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms in the homeotypic nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M=Sr, Ba). Building up a network with channels that contain the Cr3+ ions, CrB4O6N contains for the first time a tetrahedral building unit in contrast to trigonal planar B(O/N)3 entities in all other known oxonitridoborates. The structural relations as well as the results of spectroscopic measurements and calculations on the chromium oxonitridoborate are discussed.

A template&#8208;guidance protocol was reported for the synthesis of subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite. The metal ions are guided to the internal channels of the zeolite template through electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention because of their unique properties as heterogeneous catalysts. However, it is challenging to obtain uniformly distributed metal clusters under synthesis and reaction conditions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;guidance protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, with the metal ions anchored to the internal channels of the zeolite template via electrostatic interactions. Pt metal clusters with a narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22&#8197;nm have been obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (15&#8211;200). The uniformly distributed Pt clusters in Pt@H&#8208;beta are subject to strong electron withdrawal by the zeolite, which promotes transfer of active hydrogen, providing excellent activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. A general strategy is thus proposed for the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites with high thermal stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention because of their unique properties as heterogeneous catalysts. However, it is challenging to obtain uniformly distributed metal clusters under synthesis and reaction conditions. Herein, we report a template-guidance protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters uniformly encapsulated in beta-zeolite, with the metal ions anchored to the internal channels of the zeolite template via electrostatic interactions. Pt metal clusters with a narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22&#8197;nm have been obtained on the intersectional sites of beta-zeolite (Pt@beta) with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (15&#8211;200). The uniformly distributed Pt clusters in Pt@H-beta are subject to strong electron withdrawal by the zeolite, which promotes transfer of active hydrogen, providing excellent activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. A general strategy is thus proposed for the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites with high thermal stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The catalyst&#8208;free direct 1,2&#8208;carboboration of ynamides with readily available dichloroboranes is presented. Valuable &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trisubstituted alkenylboronates are obtained in high yields with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under very mild conditions.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;carboboration of ynamides is presented. Readily available aryldichloroboranes react with alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted ynamides in high yields with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to valuable &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl/aryl &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted enamides which belong to the class of trisubstituted alkenylboronates. The 1,2&#8208;carboboration reaction is experimentally easy to conduct, shows high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method. The reaction can also be used to access 1&#8208;boraphenalenes, a class of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructures by Combining Crystallization&#8208;Driven and Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Hierarchical fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures are accessible by utilizing the unique corona structure of patchy worm&#8208;like micelles immobilized on electrospun polymer fibers and the molecular self&#8208;assembly of a 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamide. The used combination of crystallization&#8208;driven and molecular self&#8208;assembly concepts can give access to a large variety of fibrillar superstructures with potential applications in filtration or catalysis.







Abstract
Combining the unique corona structure of worm&#8208;like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fiber with the molecular self&#8208;assembly of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like morphology. For this purpose, worm&#8208;like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fiber by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino&#8208;functionalized BTA to induce patch&#8208;mediated molecular self&#8208;assembly to well&#8208;defined fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibers&#8217; surface.

         <title>Efficient Inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Using Chimeric Antisense Oligonucleotides through RNase L Activation**

Based on the strategy of nucleic acid hydrolysis targeting chimera, 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;poly(A)4&#8208;modified chimeric oligonucleotides were developed for enhanced degradation of the envelope or spike RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in vitro. The oligonucleotides can recognize specific viral RNA sequences and 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)4 can activate RNase L to cleave them specifically.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs and alleviate the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Herein we report the design and construction of chimeric oligonucleotides comprising a 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe&#8208;modified antisense oligonucleotide and a 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)4 (4A2&#8208;5) to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The oligonucleotide was used for searching and recognizing target viral RNA sequence, and the conjugated 4A2&#8208;5 was used for guided RNase L activation to sequence&#8208;specifically degrade viral RNAs. Since RNase L can potently cleave single&#8208;stranded RNA during innate antiviral response, degradation efficiencies with these chimeras were twice as much as those with only antisense oligonucleotides for both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, chimera&#8208;S4 achieved potent and broad&#8208;spectrum inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its N501Y and/or &#916;H69/&#916;V70 mutants, indicating a promising antiviral agent based on the nucleic acid&#8208;hydrolysis targeting chimera (NATAC) strategy.

[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene 1 with carbodiimides and isocyanates yield four&#8208;membered metallaheterocyles 2&#8211;6. The carbodiimide cycloadditions are fully reversible at elevated temperature, as was also observed in reactions of compounds 4&#8211;6 with CO2.







Abstract
[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2) with carbodiimides [C(NR)2; R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy] and isocyanates [RNCO; R=Et, i&#8208;Pr, Cy] yielded four&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(X)NR]GaL (X=NR, R=i&#8208;Pr 2, Cy 3; X=O, R=Et 4, i&#8208;Pr 5, Cy 6). Compounds 4&#8211;6 reversibly react with CO2 via [2+2] cycloaddition at ambient temperature to the six&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]&#8208;&#956;&#8208;C(O)N(R)GaL (R=Et 7, i&#8208;Pr 8, Cy 9). Compounds 2&#8211;9 were characterized by IR and heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, while quantum chemical calculations provided a deeper understanding on the energetics of the reactions.

Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules with sound cardiovascular activities. Myxadazoles consist of a N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole ring was originated from the endogenous vitamin B12 metabolism pathway. A plausible C&#8722;N cross coupling is likely to coordinate the convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways that led to the final construction of the unique chemical scaffold of myxadazoles.







Abstract
There is a continuous need for novel microbial natural products to fill the drying&#8208;up drug development pipeline. Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules that consist of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a linear fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The experiments of genome sequencing, gene insertion mutation, isotope labelling, and precursor feeding demonstrated that the fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the origin of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole was related to the vitamin B12 metabolism. The convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways through a C&#8208;N coupling led to the unique chemical framework of myxadazoles, which is an unprecedented hybridization mode in the paradigm of natural products. Myxadazoles exhibited potent vasculogenesis promotion effect and moderate antithrombotic activity, underscoring their potential usage for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

         <title>Diarylethene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Inhibitors of Serine Proteases</title>

Bicyclic diarylethene&#8208;containing analogues of the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1) can modulate activity of serine proteases in the nanomolar&#8211;micromolar range in highly efficient photocontrollable manner.







Abstract
A bicyclic peptide scaffold was chemically adapted to generate diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine protease Bos taurus trypsin&#8197;1 (T1). Starting from a prototype molecule&#8212;sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1)&#8212;we obtained light&#8208;controllable inhibitors of T1 with Ki in the low nanomolar range, whose activity could be modulated over 20&#8208;fold by irradiation. The inhibitory potency as well as resistance to proteolytic degradation were systematically studied on a series of 17&#8197;SFTI&#8208;1 analogues. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the structure of inhibitors and possibly the enzyme&#8211;inhibitor binding dynamics were affected by isomerization of the photoswitch. The feasibility of manipulating enzyme activity in time and space was demonstrated by controlled digestion of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and an antimicrobial peptide BP100&#8208;RW. Finally, our design principles of diarylethene photoswitches are shown to apply also for the development of other serine protease inhibitors.

         <title>Imaging of Cancer Cells and Dictated Cytotoxicity Using Aptamer&#8208;Guided Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)&#8208;Generated G&#8208;Quadruplex Chains</title>

The versatility of DNA nanotechnology enables the aptamer&#8208;guided hybridization chain reaction (HCR)&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains to a discriminative imaging of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The permeation of ZnIIPPIX functionalized nanowires into the malignant TNBC cells leads to a selective cytotoxicity and an effective photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) treatment toward cancer cells.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the ZnII&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.

The analytical methods for the detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2&#8197;ppm in photo/electrocatalytic N2 fixation are evaluated rigorously, reliably, and insightfully. The low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification minefield was indicated and a rigorous ammonia detection flowchart as well as another reference standard to achieve a more accurate and responsible ammonia detection in photo/electrocatalysis was concluded.







Abstract
Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis has recently developed fast while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH3 brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Hard X&#8208;Ray Nanotomography for 3D Analysis of Coking in Nickel&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21772-21777, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of coke in nickel&#8208;based catalyst particles can be investigated by ptychographic X&#8208;ray computed tomography with sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm resolution. Based on localized changes of electron density between the activated and coked catalysts, the location of coke can be resolved in 3D at the nanoscale. This approach can be used to study different catalyst deactivation pathways on multiple length scales from nm to &#956;m.







Abstract
Understanding catalyst deactivation by coking is crucial for knowledge&#8208;based catalyst and process design in reactions with carbonaceous species. Post&#8208;mortem analysis of catalyst coking is often performed by bulk characterization methods. Here, hard X&#8208;ray ptychographic computed tomography (PXCT) was used to study Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation and CH4 dry reforming after artificial coking treatment. PXCT generated quantitative 3D maps of local electron density at ca. 80&#8197;nm resolution, allowing to visualize and evaluate the severity of coking in entire catalyst particles of ca. 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter. Coking was primarily revealed in the nanoporous solid, which was not detectable in resolved macropores. Coke formation was independently confirmed by operando Raman spectroscopy. PXCT is highlighted as an emerging characterization tool for nanoscale identification, co&#8208;localization, and potentially quantification of deactivation phenomena in 3D space within entire catalyst particles.

         <title>Active in Sleep: Iron Guanidine Catalyst Performs ROP on Dormant Side of ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21795-21800, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal catalysis combining two polymerization mechanisms in a one&#8208;pot synthesis enables facile production routes to block copolymers. An iron guanidine catalyst is able to copolymerize styrene via ATRP and lactide via ROP simultaneously. By using the FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium for ROP both mechanisms proceed in a controlled manner without interference.







Abstract
Copolymers are the answer to property limitations of homopolymers. In order to use the full variety of monomers available, catalysts active in more than one polymerization mechanism are currently investigated. Iron guanidine catalysts have shown to be extraordinarily active in ROP of lactide and herein prove their versatility by also promoting ATRP of styrene. The presented iron complex is the first polymerizing lactide and styrene simultaneously to a defined block copolymer in a convenient one&#8208;pot synthesis. Both mechanisms work hand in hand with ROP using the dominantly present FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium. This orthogonal copolymerization by a benign iron catalyst opens up new pathways to biocompatible polymerization procedures broadening the scope of ATRP applications.

We show that protonated merocyanines can act as reversible photoacids even when buffered with NaOH, attaining tunable and fully reversible jumps of up to 3 pH units between pH&#8197;7 and 4.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;switchable buffer system based on a merocyanine photoacid is presented. Para&#8208;substitution of the indolium side with a methoxy group affords a compound suitable for making hydrolytically stable aqueous buffers whose pH can be tuned between 7 and 4 using 500&#8197;nm light.

         <title>Monitoring Dynamics, Structure, and Magnetism of Switchable Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via 1H&#8208;Detected MAS&#8197;NMR</title>

Paramagnetic DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8211;organic frameworks were characterised over an extended temperature range with 1H&#8208;detected NMR techniques under fast magic&#8208;angle spinning. The sensitivity of the approach allows rapid access to structure and dynamics of the organic linkers as well as the electronic properties of the metal centres in these materials.







Abstract
We present a toolbox for the rapid characterisation of powdered samples of paramagnetic metal&#8211;organic frameworks at natural abundance by 1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Very fast MAS rates at room and cryogenic temperatures and a set of tailored radiofrequency irradiation schemes help overcome the sensitivity and resolution limits often associated with the characterisation of MOF materials. We demonstrate the approach on DUT&#8208;8(Ni), a framework containing Ni2+ paddle&#8208;wheel units which can exist in two markedly different architectures. Resolved 1H and 13C&#8197;resonances of organic linkers are detected and assigned in few hours with only 1&#8211;2&#8197;mg of sample at natural isotopic abundance, and used to rapidly extract information on structure and local internal dynamics of the assemblies, as well as to elucidate the metal electronic properties over an extended temperature range. The experiments disclose new possibilities for describing local and global structural changes and correlating them to electronic and magnetic properties of the assemblies.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Supported High&#8208;Loading Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Activation of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21751-21755, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/CN) with a Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% was developed to generate 100&#8201;% 1O2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The adsorption of terminal O and oxidation of PMS by Fe&#8208;N4 sites played the most important roles for 1O2 generation with 100&#8201;% selectivity. As a result, the Fe1/CN activated PMS system exhibited strong resistance to various factors during the degradation of organic pollutants.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of 1O2. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atoms catalyst (Fe1/CN) containing highly uniform Fe&#8208;N4 active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The Fe1/CN achieves generation of 100&#8201;% 1O2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single&#8208;atom sites, the Fe&#8208;N4 sites in Fe1/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO5.&#8722;, and thereafter efficiently generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% selectivity. In addition, the Fe1/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS. This work develops a novel catalyst for the 100&#8201;% selective production of 1O2 for highly selective and efficient degradation of pollutants.

         <title>Enabling the Use of Alkyl Thianthrenium Salts in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21756-21760, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of thianthrenium salts have been developed that can undergo C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage and be used as reliable alkyl reagents. This ability has been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Alkyl groups are one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Here, a a series of thianthrenium salts have been synthesized that act as reliable alkylation reagents and readily engage in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira reactions to build C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under mild photochemical conditions. Diverse alkyl thianthrenium salts, including methyl and disubstituted thianthrenium salts, are employed with great functional breadth, since sensitive Cl, Br, and I atoms, which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches, are compatible. The generality of the developed alkyl reagents has also been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Kumada reactions.

         <title>A Wireframe DNA Cube: Antibody Conjugate for Targeted Delivery of Multiple Copies of Monomethyl Auristatin&#8197;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21691-21696, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for preparation of an antibody, DNA wireframe cube, drug conjugate with exactly seven copies of the cytotoxic drug MMAE is presented. The drug is conjugated to a DNA strand via a cleavable linker and the conjugate is used for preparing a DNA wireframe cube. The drug loaded cube is furthermore attached to the antibody Trastuzumab. The construct is used for targeted drug delivery of MMAE to a HER2 positive cell line in vitro and a dramatic decline in viability is observed only for cells that overexpress the HER2 receptor.







Abstract
In recent years, several antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been accepted by the FDA as therapeutics against cancer. It is well&#8208;known that control of drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) is vital for the success of an ADC, which inspires the advancement of better and simpler methods for tight control of DAR. We present the development of an antibody DNA wireframe cube conjugate for precise control of DAR. The DNA wireframe cube consists of four single strands, which when folded present eight single stranded domains. One domain is bound to a monofunctionalized antibody DNA conjugate, and the seven others are attached to DNA functionalized with the potent tubulin inhibitor MMAE, thereby preparing an ADC with a DAR of precisely seven. The formation of the ADC is investigated by gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy. Lastly, the developed MMAE loaded ADC was used for targeted drug delivery in vitro.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Pd3Bi Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21741-21745, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform nanocrystals of intermetallic or solid&#8211;solution Pd3Bi alloy are prepared and demonstrated to exhibit intriguing phase dependence during electrochemical CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. The former can achieve unity formate selectivity and great CO poisoning resistance, while the latter has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60&#8201;%.







Abstract
Alloying is a general strategy for modulating the electronic structures of catalyst materials. Compared to more common solid&#8211;solution alloys, intermetallic alloys feature well&#8208;defined atomic arrangements and provide the unique platform for studying the structure&#8208;performance correlations. It is, unfortunately, synthetically challenging to prepare the nanostructures of intermetallic alloys for catalysis research. In this contribution, we prepare intermetallic Pd3Bi nanocrystals of a uniform size via a facile solvothermal method. These nanocrystals can phase&#8208;transform into solid solution alloy via thermal annealing while retaining a similar composition and size. In 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 aqueous solution, the intermetallic Pd3Bi can selectively reduce CO2 to formate with high selectivity (&#8776;100&#8201;%) and stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.35&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, whereas the solid solution alloy has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60&#8201;%. Such unique phase&#8208;dependence is understood via theoretical simulations showing that the crystallographic ordering of Pd and Bi atoms within intermetallic alloys can suppress CO poisoning and enhance the *OCHO adsorption during electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate.

         <title>Picomole&#8208;Scale Synthesis and Screening of Macrocyclic Compound Libraries by Acoustic Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21702-21707, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach has been developed for synthesizing and screening large libraries of macrocyclic compounds at a picomole scale. The macrocycles were synthesized by combinatorially transferring reagents in 2.5&#8197;nL droplets to microwell plates using acoustic waves. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a library of 2700 macrocyclic compounds was synthesized and potent inhibitors of the protein&#8211;protein interaction p53&#8211;MDM2 were identified.







Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are an attractive class of therapeutic ligands against challenging targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, the development of macrocycles as drugs is hindered by the lack of large combinatorial macrocyclic libraries, which are cumbersome, expensive, and time consuming to make, screen, and deconvolute. Here, we established a strategy for synthesizing and screening combinatorial libraries on a picomolar scale by using acoustic droplet ejection to combine building blocks at nanoliter volumes, which reduced the reaction volumes, reagent consumption, and synthesis time. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we assembled a 2700&#8208;member target&#8208;focused macrocyclic library that we could subsequently assay in the same microtiter synthesis plates, saving the need for additional transfers and deconvolution schemes. We screened the library against the MDM2&#8211;p53 protein&#8211;protein interaction and generated micromolar and sub&#8208;micromolar inhibitors. Our approach based on acoustic liquid transfer provides a general strategy for the development of macrocycle ligands.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure CO Electroreduction at Silver Produces Ethanol and Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21732-21736, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is of great interest. Here, CO reduction was studied on silver at high surface coverage, as DFT results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. The results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol, ethylene glycol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO2, copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.

     alt="High-Pressure CO Electroreduction at Silver Produces Ethanol and Propanol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to long-chain carbon products is of great interest. Here, CO reduction was studied on silver at high surface coverage, as DFT results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. The results agree with the DFT-proposed acetaldehyde-like intermediate, yielding ethanol, ethylene glycol and propanol as C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products&#8212;making the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to long-chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT-proposed acetaldehyde-like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products&#8212;making the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cycloadditions with a Stable Charge&#8208;Separated Cyclobutadiene&#8208;Type Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon Ring Compound</title>

The reductive debromination of {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 with activated magnesium yields a cyclobutadiene&#8208;type silicon ring compound 2 with a charge&#8208;separated electronic situation, which undergoes cycloadditions with alkenes and alkynes to yield unsaturated bicyclic and tricyclic silicon ring compounds with Si=Si and/or C=C double bonds (3&#8211;6).







Abstract
Reductive debromination of {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 with Rieke magnesium results in the formation of the five&#8208;vertex silicon cluster with one bromine substituent Si5{N(SiMe3)2}5Br, 1, and the cyclobutadiene analogue 2 in a 1:1 ratio. The latter features a planar four&#8208;membered silicon ring with a charge&#8208;separated electronic situation. Two silicon atoms in 2 are trigonal planar and the other two trigonal pyramidal. In cycloadditions with ethylene, diethylacetylene, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene cyclic unsaturated ring compounds (3&#8211;6) were formed at room temperature in quantitative reactions. Two of the products (3 and 6) show photochemical isomerization with LED light (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) to afford saturated ring compounds 4&#8201;e and 6&#8242;.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dioxygenation of (Aza&#8208;)Alkenols</title>

         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular difunctionalization of (aza&#8208;)alkenols with excellent regioselectivity is reported. A new generation of C&#8208;6&#8208;modified Pyox ligands together with the use of unusual hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidants enabled the generation of acyloxy&#8208;functionalized heterocycles in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An oxidative Pd&#8208;catalyzed intra&#8208;intermolecular dioxygenation of (aza&#8208;)alkenols has been reported, with total regioselectivity. To study the stereoselectivity, different chiral ligands as well as different hypervalent&#8208;iodine compounds have been compared. In particular, by using a C&#8208;6 modified pyridinyl&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) ligand and hypervalent iodine bearing an aromatic ring, an excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity has been achieved.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of amidines has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers. A wide range of benzimidazole derivatives containing N&#8722;C axial chirality can be conveniently constructed in excellent yields and enantioselectivities by intramolecular amination.







Abstract
N&#8722;C Biaryl atropisomers are prevalent in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers by stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy is presented for the synthesis of N&#8722;C axially chiral biaryl molecules. A broad spectrum of N&#8722;C axially chiral compounds was obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). The practicality of this reaction was validated in the synthesis of useful biological molecules.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Enantiopure Pyrrolidines by C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Hydrocarbons</title>

         <dc:description>
Simple hydrocarbons such as alkanes are shown to be useful building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of heterocycles. They are converted in only two steps to pyrrolidines by application of stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reactions. Symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical enantiopure 2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolidines are isolated in good yields.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8722;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8722;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a N&#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free NH&#8208;derivatives.

Nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs were fabricated from ABC triblock terpolymers through cross&#8208;linking and disassembly of prolate ellipsoidal particles. By varying the pore diameter of a Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane, the size of prolate ellipsoidal particles and the corresponding Janus discs can be well controlled.







Abstract
A straightforward method is presented for the preparation of nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs with controlled shape, size, and aspect ratio. The method relies on cross&#8208;linkable ABC triblock terpolymers and involves first the preparation of prolate ellipsoidal microparticles by combining Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane emulsification with evaporation&#8208;induced confinement assembly (EICA). By varying the pore diameter of the SPG membrane, we produce Janus discs with controlled size distributions centered around hundreds of nanometers to several microns. We further transferred the discs to water by mild sulfonation of PS to polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and verified the Janus character by subsequent labelling with cationic nanoparticles. Finally, we show that the sulfonated Janus discs are amphiphilic and can be used as efficient colloidal stabilizers for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsions.

&lt;p&gt;Nano- to micrometer-sized Janus discs were fabricated from ABC triblock terpolymers through cross-linking and disassembly of prolate ellipsoidal particles. By varying the pore diameter of a Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane, the size of prolate ellipsoidal particles and the corresponding Janus discs can be well controlled.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21746-21750, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate efficient electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane at the anode in conjunction with CO2 electrolysis at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyzer at reduced temperature.







Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is an important process in light olefin industry; however, the over&#8208;oxidation of ethane leads to low ethylene selectivity. Here, we report a novel approach to electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in anode in conjunction with CO2 reduction at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser using a porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 electrode at 600&#8201;&#176;C. We identify and engineer the flux and chemical states of active oxygen species that evolve from the lattice at anode surface to activate and dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene via the reaction of epoxy species. Active oxygen species (O2&#8722;, O22&#8722; and O2&#8722;) at the anode surface effectively dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, but O&#8722; species tend to induce deep oxidation. We demonstrate exceptionally high ethylene selectivity of 95&#8201;% and an ethane conversion of 10&#8201;% with a durable operation of 300&#8197;h.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Cobalt Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21685-21690, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylation gives Co&#8208;N4 catalysts with rich defects for use in the oxygen reduction reaction. The defect near the Co&#8208;N4 site weakens the adsorption free energy of OOH on the cobalt active center, which significantly improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Co&#8208;N4 site and leads to a remarkable turnover frequency.







Abstract
Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we report a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance show better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of the 6,10&#8208;Bicyclic Eunicellane Skeleton by the Bacterial Diterpene Synthase Bnd4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic and mechanistic characterization of Bnd4, a bacterial diterpene synthase and the first terpene synthase known to form the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic eunicellane skeleton. Isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the cyclization mechanism for benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene. An unusual DNxxxD motif was found to be essential for cyclization activity.







Abstract
The eunicellane diterpenoids are a unique family of natural products seen in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. We used a series of biochemical, bioinformatics, and theoretical experiments to investigate the mechanism of the first diterpene synthase known to form the eunicellane skeleton. Deuterium labeling studies and quantum chemical calculations support that Bnd4, from Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4), forms the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic skeleton through a 1,10&#8208;cyclization, 1,3&#8208;hydride shift, and 1,14&#8208;cyclization cascade. Bnd4 also demonstrated sesquiterpene cyclase activity and the ability to prenylate small molecules. Bnd4 possesses a unique D94NxxxD motif and mutation experiments confirmed an absolute requirement for D94 as well as E169.

         <title>A Heteromeric Carboxylic Acid Based Single&#8208;Crystalline Crosslinked Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework was synthesized through heteromeric monomers co&#8208;crystallization followed by thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking. The crosslinked porous crystals featured large pores to host a hydrazone switch for solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;patterning.







Abstract
The development of large pore single&#8208;crystalline covalently linked organic frameworks is critical in revealing the detailed structure&#8208;property relationship with substrates. One emergent approach is to photo&#8208;crosslink hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals. Introducing complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonded carboxylic acid building blocks is promising to construct large pore networks, but these molecules often form interpenetrated networks or non&#8208;porous solids. Herein, we introduced heteromeric carboxylic acid dimers to construct a non&#8208;interpenetrated molecular crystal. Crosslinking this crystal precursor with dithiols afforded a large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework HCOF&#8208;101. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed HCOF&#8208;101 as an interlayer connected hexagonal network, which possesses flexible linkages and large porous channels to host a hydrazone photoswitch. Multicycle Z/E&#8208;isomerization of the hydrazone took place reversibly within HCOF&#8208;101, showcasing the potential use of HCOF&#8208;101 for optical information storage.

         <title>Tuneable time delay in the burst release from oxidation sensitive polymersomes made by PISA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confinement in and the selective release from vesicular structures is an elementary part of biological transport processes and highly attractive for drug delivery systems. Reactive polymersomes represent a versatile artificial cargo carrier system, which can facilitate an immediate release in response to a specific stimulus. The herein presented oxidation&#8208;sensitive polymersomes feature a time delayed release mechanism in an oxidative environment, which can be precisely adjusted by either tuning the membrane thickness or partial pre&#8208;oxidation. These polymeric vesicles are conveniently prepared by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) allowing the straightforward and effective  in situ  encapsulation of cargo molecules, as exemplarily shown for fluorescence dyes and functional enzymes. Detailed kinetic studies revealed a critical degree of oxidation causing the destabilization of the membrane, while no release of the cargo is observed beforehand. The encapsulation of glucose oxidase transforms these polymersomes directly into glucose&#8208;sensitive vesicles, as small molecules including sugars can passively penetrate their membrane. Considering the ease of preparation, the presented polymersomes represent a versatile platform for the confinement and a burst release of cargo molecules after a precisely adjustable time span in the presence of specific triggers, such as hydrogen peroxide or glucose.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Fixed Hydroboration of Terminal and Internal Alkenes using BX3/iPr2NEt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented and general hydroboration of alkenes with BX3(X = Br, Cl) as the boration reagent in the presence of  iPr2NEt is reported. The addition of  iPr2NEt not only suppresses alkene polymerization and haloboration side reactions but also provides an "H" source for hydroboration. More importantly, the site&#8208;fixed installation of a boryl group at the original position of the internal double&#8208;bond is readily achieved as compared with conventional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration processes. Further application to the synthesis of 1, n&#8208;diborylalkanes (n=3&#8208;10) is also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a major reaction pathway that involves radical species and operates through frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;pair&#8208;type single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond of THF  via  forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8211;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond functionalization of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent. The high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy, high efficiency and broad substrate scope make the photocatalysis with QDs and visible light promising in both academic and industrial setting.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven nanomotors have attracted much attention due to their potential applications. The movement of conventional nanomotors typically occurs in the solution phase, which limits their application fields. Utilizing visible light to drive nanomotors at the solid&#8211;liquid interface represents a grand challenge due to the large friction force between the nanomotor and the solid surface. Based on the attractive plasmon resonance of Au nanocrystals, for the first time, plasmon&#8208;enhanced Au nanocrystal&#8208;based nanomotors moving at the silicon&#8211;aqueous solution interface have been developed. Such nanomotors move with a clear trace engraved on the Si surface, representing an excellent and exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. In addition, the nanomotor trace on the Si surface also provides a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale Si patterns, which is central to many applications, including microelectronics, sensing, information storage, and optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced    Fragmentation   of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e  &#8208;  ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H  2  O  2  production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2e  &#8208;  ORR greatly restrict the H  2  O  2  production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the  terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions  . The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H  2  O  2  generation rate (3265.4 &#181;M h  &#8208;1  ), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O  2  , which optimizes O  2  activation and reduces the energy barrier of H  2  O  2  formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O  2  activation in ORR for H  2  O  2  production.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning and Directing Energy Transfer in the Whole Visible Spectrum through Linker Installation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While limited choice of emissive organic linkers with systematic emission tunability presents a great challenge to investigate energy transfer (ET) over the whole visible light range with designable directions, luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) may serve as an ideal platform for such study due to their readily tunable structure and composition. Herein, five Zr  6  cluster&#8208;based LMOFs, HIAM&#8208;400X (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. Their emission energies range from ~470 to 645 nm. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM&#8208;400X as a pristine scaffold for postsynthetic modification via linker installation. Six 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based dicarboxylic acids (L) with their emission energies covering the entire visible spectrum were successfully installed into HIAM&#8208;400X matrix to form thirty HIAM&#8208;400X&#8208;L LMOFs, in which the energy transfer can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two&#8208;dimensional space in tuning the emission via energy transfer in LMOFs. This work sheds light on a new strategy in designing target&#8208;specific materials for light&#8208;harvesting, energy transfer and related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8722;COCl Bond Cleavage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a catalytic system comprised of Pd and Xantphos, acid chlorides can be added across strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to form two new C&#8722;C bonds via formal C&#8722;COCl cleavage. This reaction allows for a dicarbofunctionalisation in which an acid chloride group is retained in the product. DFT studies are used to rationalise a plausible pathway, while product derivatisation highlights the synthetic utility of the method.







Abstract
Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8722;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or a tethered alkyne to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride in situ. The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.

         <title>Rational Design of Sustainable Liquid Microcapsules for Spontaneous Fragrance Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a PEG&#8208;g&#8208;PVAc amphiphilic graft copolymer together with hydrophobic fragrances in aqueous medium leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidally stable suspensions of liquid coacervate droplets. Arrows indicate the local turbulences sustaining the spontaneous mixing of the components. The bottom panel shows the confocal Raman microspectroscopy mapping of a multicompartment coacervate droplet with carvone as fragrance.







Abstract
The high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. Herein, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.

         <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Valent Lanthanide Sulfide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4; and EuS, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4 were prepared. The phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.







Abstract
In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu3S4, EuSm2S4, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO&#8208;66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS2 sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allows photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2 reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2 composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH3COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2 for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.

&lt;p&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO-66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nodes to form Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allows photo-catalytic conversion of gas phase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO-66 (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-UiO-66) to form Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO-66 and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo-generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-UiO-66/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite facilitates the photo-catalytic conversion of gas phase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge-polarized Zr-O-Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery and Characterisation of Highly Cooperative FAK&#8208;Degrading PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.







Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in&#8208;vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (&#8776;96&#8197;h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK&#8208;degradation biology in&#8197;vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cross&#8208;coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with alkylamine and aldehyde feedstocks has been achieved. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained with generally good yields and optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible with excellent stereocontrol. This method provides a novel disconnection strategy for the synthesis of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes that utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.

         <title>Biocatalytic C3&#8208;Indole Methylation&#8212;A Useful Tool for the Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired Stereoselective Synthesis of Pyrroloindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the promiscuous C3&#8208;indole methyl transferase PsmD enabled the enantioselective synthesis of various pyrroloindolines. By additionally applying the halo methyl transferase CtHMT not only the expensive SAM cofactor could be recycled, but also the enzymatic preparative scale transformation was achieved.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM&#8208;dependent methyl transferase PsmD from Streptomyces griseofuscus, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope were demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2/Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocol that employs catalytic hydroquinone with tBuOOH as a benign terminal oxidant. A bromide additive was crucial to obtaining good yields and excellent cis selectivity. The study culminates in the implementation of the optimized reaction on large scale.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO2, which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from trans to cis diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high cis selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large&#8208;scale applications.

Oxidation&#8208;induced reduction: The oxidation of mononuclear CuII complexes with novel unsymmetric redox&#8208;active urea azine or thio&#8208;urea azine ligands leads to metal reduction and formation of complexes with intriguing electronic structures. The stability in several redox states is the basis for their first application in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)2] and [Cu(L2)2] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)2]+ and [Cu(L2)2]+ with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)2]+ is best described as a CuI complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)2]+ is a CuI complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)2]2+, best described as a CuI complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile ligand&#8208;metal electron transfer make these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.

         <title>Li2MTeO6 (M=Ti, Sn): Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Wide Transparency Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New tellurate LTT and LST crystals were obtained by a TSSG method with a broad transparent region of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m for MIR NLO applications. Both LTT and LST belong to the space group Pnn2, with an almost identical structure. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder SHG response. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder SHG based on the crystal structures.







Abstract
Oxide crystals have been widely used in nonlinear optics (NLO) in the ultraviolet&#8211;visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Most traditional oxide crystals are restricted to the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxides has attracted much attention. Herein, we report two new tellurates Li2TiTeO6 (LTT) and Li2SnTeO6 (LST) with broad transparent regions of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, as excellent candidates for mid&#8208;infrared NLO applications. Both LTT and LST crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnn2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064&#8197;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. They also pave a way for the design of new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.

         <title>PtSe2/Pt Heterointerface with Reduced Coordination for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small Pt particles are generated in situ on the surface of PtSe2 nanosheet with Se vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
PtSe2 is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe2/Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe2, enabled by an in situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H. intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2/Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.

         <title>Designing Anion&#8208;Type Water&#8208;Free Zn2+ Solvation Structure for Robust Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free Zn2+ solvation structure electrolyte for developing a Zn metal anode. The chloride salt with bulky cations unlocks the Zn2+&#8208;water interactions, and a new solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722; is formed without bound water. Owing to the limited hydrogen evolution reaction and the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and anion, the electrolyte shows an average Zn plating/stripping CE of &#8776;99.9&#8201;% and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries are potential for large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage due to their low cost and high security. However, Zn metal anode suffers from the dendritic growth and interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in the deterioration of electrode/battery performance. Here we propose that both dendrites and HER are related to the water participated Zn2+ solvation structure&#8208;Zn(H2O)62+ and thus can be resolved by transforming Zn(H2O)62+ to an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722;, which is achieved in traditional ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte after adding chloride salt with a bulky cation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). The elimination of cation&#8208;water interaction suppresses HER, while the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and the anion solvation structure inhibits dendrite formation. As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.9&#8201;%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles in anode&#8208;free Zn batteries with pre&#8208;zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long&#8208;lifespan metal anode.

         <title>Selective Detection of Cu+ Ions in Live Cells via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a new fluorescent probe that upon binding to copper(I) (but not any other physiologically relevant metal ions), displays an intensity switch&#8208;on as well as a significant change in its fluorescence lifetime. The later has allowed us to visualize copper(I) in live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
Copper is an essential trace element in living organisms with its levels and localisation being carefully managed by the cellular machinery. However, if misregulated, deficiency or excess of copper ions can lead to several diseases. Therefore, it is important to have reliable methods to detect, monitor and visualise this metal in cells. Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch&#8208;on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch-on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topochemical Ene&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed monomer having reactive groups, azide and alkene, adopts suitable crystal packing for a novel topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction (TEAC). Spontaneously, the monomer undergoes polymerization to yield triazoline&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. The triazoline&#8208;linked polymer is transformed into a value&#8208;added aziridine&#8208;linked polymer by simple heating.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives, are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety. However, the bottleneck is the limited number of reactions that can be done in the crystal medium. We present the topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer. This reaction may revolutionize the field of polymer science.

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8211;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic capability of squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases to convert (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;substrates enantiospecifically to (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;configurated monocyclic terpenoids was put into action by a combination of enzyme evolution and substrate engineering for the synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone with &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC&#8208;wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (AciSHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (E/Z)&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed AciSHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)&#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99&#8201;% ee), the (E)&#8208;isomer was converted to the (S,S)&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95&#8201;% ee). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9&#8201;% ee) could be obtained.

Muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene visualized a paramagnetic species produced by addition of muonium (Mu). DFT calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two isomers, and the metastable conformer including the almost planar fused tricyclic unit simulated the experimental hfcs. The metastable structure is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to light muon (&#956;+).







Abstract
In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#956;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#956;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#956;SR and &#956;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#956;+), one ninth of the proton mass.

         <title>Chemoselective and Highly Sensitive Quantification of Gut Microbiome and Human Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective probes based on stable isotope labeling allow for highly sensitive mass spectrometric quantification and detection of metabolites at attomole quantities in three human sample types.







Abstract
The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host's physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics&#8208;driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our chemical biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.

         <title>Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic&#8208;Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), R&#8208;CatchER and G&#8208;CatchER2, with ultrafast kinetics and large fluorescence dynamic ranges are introduced. R&#8208;CatchER was applied to sense multi&#8208;scale calcium dynamics in endoplasmic reticulum. A design principle of GECIs is proposed that features a tuning of rapid dynamics and electrostatic potentials of fluorescent proteins.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;scale calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, exhibiting wide&#8208;ranging temporal kinetics, constitutes a ubiquitous mode of signal transduction. We report a novel endoplasmic&#8208;reticulum&#8201;(ER)&#8208;targeted Ca2+ indicator, R&#8208;CatchER, which showed superior kinetics in&#8197;vitro (koff&#8805;2&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1, kon&#8805;7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and in multiple cell types. R&#8208;CatchER captured spatiotemporal ER Ca2+ dynamics in neurons and hotspots at dendritic branchpoints, enabled the first report of ER Ca2+ oscillations mediated by calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs), and revealed ER Ca2+&#8208;based functional cooperativity of CaSR. We elucidate the mechanism of R&#8208;CatchER and propose a principle to rationally design genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators with a single Ca2+&#8208;binding site and fast kinetics by tuning rapid fluorescent&#8208;protein dynamics and the electrostatic potential around the chromophore. The design principle is supported by the development of G&#8208;CatchER2, an upgrade of our previous (G&#8208;)CatchER with improved dynamic range. Our work may facilitate protein design, visualizing Ca2+ dynamics, and drug discovery.

     alt="Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic-Reticulum Calcium Dynamics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), R-CatchER and G-CatchER2, with ultrafast kinetics and large fluorescence dynamic ranges are introduced. R-CatchER was applied to sense multi-scale calcium dynamics in endoplasmic reticulum. A design principle of GECIs is proposed that features a tuning of rapid dynamics and electrostatic potentials of fluorescent proteins.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling&#8208;Enabled Reactivity of Manganese Metal**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;mediated reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates by ball milling is reported. The process has been optimised and its mechanism explored by CV measurements, radical trapping, and EPR spectroscopy. Control experiments identify the action of ball milling rather than mortar and pestle is necessary to realise the effective activation of manganese, which can then be used in either solution or a ball mill for subsequent reactions.







Abstract
Efforts to generate organomanganese reagents under ball&#8208;milling conditions have led to the serendipitous discovery that manganese metal can mediate the reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates. The newly uncovered process has been optimized and its mechanism explored using CV measurements, radical trapping experiments, EPR spectroscopy, and solution control reactions. This unique reactivity can also be translated to solution whereupon pre&#8208;milling of the manganese is required.

         <title>A Titanium Nitride Nanozyme for pH&#8208;Responsive and Irradiation&#8208;Enhanced Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doping significantly improves the peroxidase (POD) activity of titanium&#8208;based nanozymes. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) showed enhanced POD activity under NIR laser irradiation due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and temperature effects. Combined with glucose oxidase in liposomes, a TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;based nanoplatform (TLGp) showed an excellent antitumor activity under NIR&#8208;mediated mild thermal conditions through its cascade&#8208;catalytic activity.







Abstract
Nanozyme&#8208;based catalytic tumor therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic&#8208;atom doping and irradiation. Nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes, which was shown experimentally and theoretically. Based on the excellent NIR&#8208;adsorption&#8208;induced surface plasmon resonance and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping, and irradiation&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy enables an effective tumor inhibition by TLGp with minimal side effects in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color Tuning of Narrowband Emission in Multi&#8208;resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescence Materials through Rational Imine/Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile design strategy enabled wide&#8208;range color tuning of narrowband emissions in organoboron luminogenic molecules. The introduction of imine and amine moieties into a boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton (see structures) caused hypsochromic and bathochromic emission band shifts, respectively, thereby leading to deep&#8208;blue to yellow narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence with excellent color purity.







Abstract
Establishing a simple and versatile design strategy to finely modulate emission colors while retaining high luminescence efficiency and color purity remains an appealing yet challenging task for the development of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials. Herein, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing imine and electron&#8208;donating amine moieties into a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton enables systematic hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts of narrowband emissions, respectively. By this method, effective electroluminescence color tuning was accomplished over a wide visible range from deep&#8208;blue to yellow (461&#8211;571&#8197;nm), using the same MR molecular system, without compromising very narrow spectral features. Deep&#8208;blue to yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 19.0&#8211;29.2&#8201;% and superb color purity could be produced with this family of color&#8208;tunable MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity, &#956;M affinities and high turn&#8208;on ratios. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.







Abstract
Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with Kd values ranging from 190&#8197;nM to 74&#8197;&#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn2+ co&#8208;released with insulin during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording of isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt;100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets. The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn2+ and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.

         <title>A Simple Gas&#8211;Solid Treatment for Surface Modification of Li&#8208;Rich Oxides Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gas&#8211;solid treatment of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with ferrous oxalate is proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancies and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with high capacity are expected to be the next generation of cathode materials. However, the irreversible and sluggish anionic redox reaction leads to the O2 loss in the surface as well as the capacity and voltage fading. In the present study, a simple gas&#8211;solid treatment with ferrous oxalate has been proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancy and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion. In addition, the surface doping of Fe&#8208;ion can further stabilize the structure. Accordingly, the treated Feox&#8208;2&#8201;% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% and 85.5&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C and 2&#8197;C to that (75.3&#8201;% and 75.0&#8201;%) of the pristine sample after 300&#8197;cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011&#8197;V per cycle at 2&#8197;C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides cathode.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Carboxylation Reaction of 1,1&#8208;Diarylethylenes via Hydrorhodation&#8208;Rhodium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives has been achieved by using a bulky rhodium catalyst under a CO2 atmosphere. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that tandem hydrorhodation and rhodium migrations, which include unique aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration, are operative in the reaction conditions.







Abstract
A meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation reaction of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives with CO2 by using a rhodium catalyst with NaOiPr as a stoichiometric reductant has been achieved. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the meta&#8208;position of the aryl ring with high selectivity over the ortho&#8208;positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration and successive 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium shift.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Markovnikov Hydroxycarbonylation and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Vinyl Arenes: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropanoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids has been developed. Several non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, and ketoprofen were synthesized in high yields and ees in gram scale.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydroxycarbonylation is one of the most fundamental yet challenging methods for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. Herein, we reported the development of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water. A monodentate phosphoramidite ligand L6 plays vital role in the reaction. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups, and provides a facile and atom&#8208;economical approach to an array of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids including several commonly used non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The catalytic system has also enabled an asymmetric Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with alcohols to afford 2&#8208;arylpropanates. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the hydropalladation is irreversible and is the regio&#8208; and enantiodetermining step, while hydrolysis/alcoholysis is probably the rate&#8208;limiting step.

The first total syntheses of complex bergamotane sesquiterpenes massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide&#8197;C were achieved with key steps involving an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement, a furan oxidative cyclization, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation and sigmatropic elimination. Our synthesis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A.







Abstract
Massarinolin&#8197;A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxaspiro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the exo methylene group of massarinolin&#8197;A.
