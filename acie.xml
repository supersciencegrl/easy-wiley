      <title>Conjugated Polymer Entailing Arylazopyrazole Units in the Side Chains for Optically Tunable Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Near Infra&#8208;red Light</title>
      <dc:description>Optically tunable field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with near infra&#8208;red (NIR) light show promising applications in various areas. Here, we incorporate arylazopyrazole groups in the side chains of a semiconducting donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymer. The  cis  &#8208;  trans  interconversion of the arylazopyrazole can be controlled by 980 nm and 808 nm NIR light irradiation, by utilising NaYF  4  :Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles and the photothermal effect&#160;of conjugated D&#8208;A polymers, respectively. This reversible transformation affects the interchain packing of the polymer thin film, which in turn reversibly tunes the semiconducting properties of the FETs by the successive 980 nm and 808 nm light irradiation. The resultant FETs display fast response to NIR light, good resistance to photofatigue, and stability in storage for up to 120 days. These unique features will be useful in future memory and bioelectronic wearable devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing Machinery Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Vehicles</title>
      <dc:description>Recent innovations in genome editing have enabled the precise manipulation of the genetic information of mammalians, and benefitted the development of next&#8208;generation gene therapy. Despite these advances, several barriers to the clinical translation of genome editing remain, including the intracellular delivery of genome editing machinery, and the risk of off&#8208;target editing effect. Here, we review the recent advance of spatiotemporal delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing machinery, which is composed of programmable Cas9 nuclease and a single&#8208;guide RNA (sgRNA) using stimuli&#8208;responsive  nanoparticles. We discuss the specific chemistries that have been used for controlled Cas9/sgRNA delivery and intracellular release in the presence of endogenous or external signals. These methodologies can leverage biological signals found locally within disease cells, or exogenous signals administrated with spatiotemporal control, through which an improved genome editing could be achieved. We also discuss the future in exploiting these approaches for fundamental biomedical applications and therapeutic genome editing.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective Catalytic Dehydrogenative Oxidation of Bio&#8208;polyols to Lactic Acid</title>
      <dc:description>The global demand for lactic acid (LA) is increasing due to its prominence as a bio&#8208;based platform molecule and its successful application as a monomer for bio&#8208;plastics manufacture. The development of new, selective, and sustainable approaches for LA synthesis using highly active catalysts is becoming critically important. Although N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) iridium complexes have been proven as promising molecular catalysts for this purpose, their instabilities have seriously hindered their potential utilization especially in commercial applications. Here, we report for the first time that a porous self&#8208;supported NHC&#8208;iridium coordination polymer can efficiently prevent the clusterization of corresponding NHC&#8208;Ir molecules and can function as a solid molecular recyclable catalyst for dehydrogenation of a number of bio&#8208;polyols to make LA with excellent activity (97%) and selectivity (&gt;99%), and up to 5700 turnover number could be achieved in a single batch, due to the synergistic participation of the Ba2+ and hydroxide ions, as well as the blockage of unwanted pathways by adding methanol.

      <title>Triplet acceptors with D&#8208;A structure and twisted conformation for efficient organic solar cells</title>
      <dc:description>Triplet acceptors have been developed to construct high performance organic solar cells (OSCs) since the long lifetime and diffusion range of triplet excitons may dissociate into free charges instead of net recombination when the energy levels of triplet states (T  1  ) are close to those of charge transfer states (  3  CT). The current triplet acceptors were designed by introducing heavy atoms to enhance the intersystem crossing, limiting their applications. Herein, two twisted acceptors without heavy atoms, analogues of Y6, were constructed with large &#960;&#8208;conjugated core and D&#8208;A structure, proved to be triplet materials, leading to a high performance OSCs. The mechanism of triplet excitons were investigated to show that the twisted and D&#8208;A structures result in large spin orbital coupling (SOC) and small energy gap between the singlet and triplet states, and thus efficient intersystem crossing. Moreover, the energy level of T  1  is close to  3  CT, facilitating the split of triplet exciton to free charges. This contribution provided new insights in working mechanism of triplet excitons in OSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Huisgen&#8217;s 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions to Fulvenes via Ambimodal [6+4]/[4+2] Transition States</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Huisgen&#8217;s 1960 announcement of the concept of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions was published the year before Alder&#8217;s study of the reaction of diazomethane and dimethylfulvene. The diazomethane reaction was studied again in 1970 by Houk et al., and shown to give a [6+4] adduct. Padwa&#8217;s nitrile ylide cycloaddition to dimethylfulvene (1978) gave [6+4] and [4+2] adducts. We have performed computational studies of these reactions with DFT and show that they involve ambimodal [6+4]/[4+2] transition states that can lead to either type of cycloadduct from one transition state. We dedicate this paper to the extraordinary life and humanity of Rolf Huisgen, and to the undying influence of his discoveries on chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Dissipative assembly of macrocycles comprising multiple transient bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Dissipative (nonequilibrium) assembly powered by chemical fuels has great potential for the creation of new adaptive chemical systems. However, while molecular assembly at equilibrium is routinely used to prepare complex architectures from polyfunctional monomers, species formed out of equilibrium have, to this point, been structurally very simple. In most examples the fuel simply effects the formation of a single short&#8208;lived covalent bond. Here, we show that chemical fuels can assemble bifunctional components into macrocycles containing multiple transient bonds. Specifically, dicarboxylic acids give aqueous dianhydride macrocycles on treatment with a carbodiimide. The macrocycles are assembled efficiently as a consequence of both fuel&#8208;dependent and &#8208;independent mechanisms: they undergo slower decomposition, building up as the fuel recycles the components, and are a favored product of the dynamic exchange of the anhydride bonds.

      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;halide double perovskites present a new branch for achieving versatile physical merits due to their huge structural compatibility, whereas room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity is still a blank for this fascinating family.

It exhibits concrete ferroelectricity including Curie temperature of 305 K and large spontaneous polarization of 3.2 &#956;C/cm  2  , triggered by dynamic ordering of organic cation and tilting motions of heterometal AgBr  6  /BiBr  6  octahedra. Besides, the alternating array of inorganic perovskite sheets and organic cations endows large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (  &#956;&#964;  = 1.0&#215;10  &#8208;3  cm  2  &#8729;V  &#8208;1  ) for detecting X&#8208;ray photons, being almost tenfold higher than that of CH  3  NH  3  PbI  3  wafers. As far as we know, this is the first study on X&#8208;ray&#8208;sensitive ferroelectric of 2D halide double perovskites.

      <title>Inverse vulcanized polymers with shape memory, enhanced mechanical properties, and vitrimer behavior</title>
      <dc:description>The invention of inverse vulcanization provides great opportunities for generating functional polymers directly from elemental sulfur, an industrial by&#8208;product. However, unsatisfactory mechanical properties have limited the scope for wider applications of these exciting materials. Here, we report an effective synthesis method that significantly improves mechanical properties of sulfur&#8208;polymers and allows control of performance. A linear pre&#8208;polymer containing hydroxyl functional group was produced, which could be stored at room temperature for long periods of time. This prepolymer was then further cross linked by difunctional isocyanate secondary crosslinker. By adjusting the molar ratio of crosslinking functional groups, the tensile strength was controlled, ranging from 0.14&#177;0.01 MPa to 20.17&#177;2.18 MPa, and strain was varied from 11.85&#177;0.88% to 51.20&#177;5.75%. Control of hardness, flexibility, solubility and function of the material were also demonstrated. We were able to produce materials with suitable combination of flexibility and strength, with excellent shape memory function. Combined with the unique dynamic property of S&#8208;S bonds, these polymer networks have an attractive, vitrimer&#8208;like ability for being reshaped and recycled, despite their crosslinked structures. This new synthesis method could open the door for wider applications of sustainable sulfur&#8208;polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Can Anti&#8208;Aufbau DFT Calculations Estimate Singlet Excited State Aromaticity? Correspondence on &#8220;Dibenzoarsepins: Planarization of 8&#960;&#8208;Electron System in the Lowest Singlet Excited State&#8221;</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
The simple anti&#8208;aufbau DFT approach for estimating singlet excited state aromaticity suggested in a recent Communication published in this journal is shown to produce incorrect results because it targets a linear combination of the singlet and triplet configurations involving the HOMO and LUMO rather than the first singlet excited state. If the S1 state of a molecule is dominated by the HOMO&#8594;LUMO excitation, a comparably simple but theoretically consistent and qualitatively correct approximation to the S1 wavefunction can be achieved by performing a small &#8220;two electrons in two orbitals&#8221; CASSCF(2,2) calculation which can be followed by the evaluation of magnetic aromaticity criteria such as NICS.

      <title>Thiophene cation intercalation improves bandedge integrity in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites with reduced&#8208;dimensional (RD) crystal structures have attracted attention for application in photovoltaics. The insertion of large organic cations increases the crystal formation energy and regulates the growth orientation of the inorganic domains, which benefits materials and device stability. However, the power conversion performance of RD perovskite devices is curtailed by the insulating nature of the bulky cations. Here we investigate a series of RD perovskites with 2&#8208;thiophenmethylammonium (TMA) as the intercalating cation. Compared with traditional ligands, such as phenethylammonium (PEA), TMA demonstrates improved electron transfer in the inorganic framework. In addition, TMA modifies the near&#8208;bandedge integrity of the RD perovskite, improving hole transport. We achieve as a result a power conversion efficiency of 19%, the highest efficiency reported to date for TMA&#8208;based RD perovskite photovoltaics; these TMA devices provide a 12% relative increase in PCE compared to control RD perovskite devices that use PEA as the intercalating ligand, a result of the improved charge transfer from the inorganic layer to the organic ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Boosting Catalytic Nanoreactor Integrated with Triggerable Crosslinking Membrane Networks for Initiation of Immunogenic Cell Death by Pyroptosis</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic polymer vesicles spur novel strategies for producing biologically intelligent nanodevices with precise and specific functions (e.g. nanoreactors). Engineering vesicular nanodevices with tunable permeability by a general platform without involving trade&#8208;offs between structural integrity, flexibility and functionality remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy to construct responsive nanoreactors based on polyion complex vesicles by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive linkers into crosslinking membrane network. The formulated ROS&#8208;responsive nanoreactor with self&#8208;boosting catalytic glucose oxidation could protect glucose oxidase (GOD) to maintain long&#8208;term activity to achieve cytocidal function by oxidative stress induction and glucose starvation, which is ascribed to stimuli&#8208;responsive vesicle expansion without fracture and size&#8208;selective cargo release behavior. The GOD&#8208;loaded therapeutic nanoreactor induced an immunostimulatory form of cell death by pyroptosis, which has the great potential to prime anti&#8208;tumor immune responses.</dc:description>

Engineering vesicular nanodevices with tunable permeability by a general platform without involving trade&#8208;offs between structural integrity, flexibility and functionality remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy to construct responsive nanoreactors based on polyion complex vesicles by integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive linkers into crosslinking membrane network. The formulated ROS&#8208;responsive nanoreactor with self&#8208;boosting catalytic glucose oxidation could protect glucose oxidase (GOD) to maintain long&#8208;term activity to achieve cytocidal function by oxidative stress induction and glucose starvation, which is ascribed to stimuli&#8208;responsive vesicle expansion without fracture and size&#8208;selective cargo release behavior. The GOD&#8208;loaded therapeutic nanoreactor induced an immunostimulatory form of cell death by pyroptosis, which has the great potential to prime anti&#8208;tumor immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ternary Sn&#8208;Ti&#8208;O Electrocatalyst Boosts the Stability and Energy Efficiency of CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Simultaneously improving energy efficiency (EE) and material stability in electrochemical CO  2  conversion remains an unsolved challenge. Among a series of ternary Sn&#8208;Ti&#8208;O electrocatalysts, 3D ordered mesoporous (3DOM) Sn  0.3  Ti  0.7  O  2  achieves a trade&#8208;off between active sites exposure and structural stability, demonstrating up to 71.5% half&#8208;cell EE over 200 hours and 94.5% Faradaic efficiency for CO at an overpotential as low as 430 mV. Density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal an electron density reconfiguration in the Sn&#8208;Ti&#8208;O system. A downshift of the orbital band centre of Sn and a charge depletion of Ti collectively facilitate the dissociative adsorption of desired intermediate COOH* for CO formation. It is also beneficial in maintaining a local alkaline environment to suppress H  2  and formate formation and in stabilizing oxygen atoms to prolong durability. These findings provide a new strategy of material design for efficient CO  2  conversion and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>POM&#8208;incorporated CoO nanowires for enhanced photocatalytic syngas production from CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Utilizing sustainable energy (sunlight, electricity, etc) for chemical activation of small molecules, especially environmentally unfavorable CO  2  , to produce important chemical feedstocks is crucial and highly desirable. Among them, the simultaneous production of CO/H  2  mixture (syngas) from photoreduction of CO  2  and H  2  O has been proved highly promising. However, the relationships between structures, composition, crystallinity and photocatalytic performance are still somehow indistinct. Here, we synthesized ultrathin CoO nanowires with low crystallinity, of which could be further reduced by incorporating polyoxometalate (POM). The POM&#8208;incorporated ultrathin nanowires exhibit high photocatalytic syngas production activity, reaching remarkable H  2  and CO evolution rates of 11555 and 4165 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  respectively. Further controllable experiments indicate that the ultrathin morphology and incorporation of POM both contribute to the superior performance.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Dialkyl Ketones from the Coupling of&#160;N&#8208;Alkyl Pyridinium Salts with Activated Carboxylic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>While ketones are among the most versatile functional groups, their synthesis remains reliant upon reactive and low abundance starting materials. In contrast, amide formation is the most&#8208;used bond construction in medicinal chemistry because the chemistry is reliable and draws upon large, diverse substrate pools. A new method for the synthesis of ketones is presented here that draws from the same substrates used for amide bond synthesis:&#160;&#160;amines and carboxylic acids. A nickel terpyridine catalyst couples&#160;  N  &#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts with&#160;  in&#8208;situ  &#160;formed carboxylic acid fluorides or 2&#8208;pyridyl esters under reducing conditions (Mn metal). The reaction has broad scope, as demonstrated by the synthesis of 35&#160;different ketones bearing a wide variety of functional groups with an average yield of 60 &#177; 16%. This approach is capable of coupling diverse substrates, including pharmaceutical intermediates, to rapidly form complex ketones.</dc:description>

      <title>MOF&#8208;Derived Double&#8208;Layer Hollow Nanoparticles with Oxygen Generation for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>The high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and simple construction of sonosensitizer systems remain challenging in sonodynamic therapy against the hypoxic tumor. In this work, we rationally prepared MOF&#8208;derived double&#8208;layer hollow manganese silicate nanoparticle (DHMS) with highly effective ROS yield under ultrasound irradiation for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The presence of Mn element in DHMS increased ROS generation efficiency, because it could be oxidized by holes to improve the separation of electron&#8211;hole. Moreover, DHMS could produce oxygen in the tumor microenvironment, which helps overcome the hypoxia of the solid tumor and thus enhance the treatment efficiency. In vivo experiments demonstrated efficient tumor inhibition in DHMS&#8208;mediated SDT guided by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. This work presented a MOF&#8208;derived nanoparticle harboring sonosensitive and oxygen generating ability, which provides a promising strategy for tumor hypoxia in SDT.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Conductive MXene Film Actuator Based on Moisture Gradients</title>
      <dc:description>MXene (Ti3C2Tx  ) is a new 2D material with both hydrophilicity and high electrical conductivity that has shown promise in smart electronic devices. However, the humidity&#8208;driven capabilities of MXene similar to graphene oxide are still unknown. Herein, we report a homogeneous MXene film actuator with high electrical conductivity triggered by moisture gradients and reveal the driving mechanism. The actuator is highly sensitive to moisture and has a considerable amount of deformation; the maximum bending angle can be as high as 155&#176; at the relative humidity difference of 65%. Several analysis methods show that the humidity drive and large deformation of the MXene film are formed in situ by the asymmetric expansion of the bilayer structure. The combination of outstanding deformation and excellent electrical conductivity makes this film applicable to flexible excavators, electrical switches and other fields, which is difficult to achieve directly by using other 2D materials. More importantly, this work further expands the new application ranges of MXene materials and provides new opportunities for building the next generation of high&#8208;conductivity smart actuators.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have produced enormous perception in the field of optoelectronics due to their fascinating optical properties, however, an in&#8208;depth understanding on their shape&#8208;controlled charge&#8208;carrier recombination dynamics is still lacking, which could be resolved by exploring the photoluminescence (PL) blinking behaviour at the single&#8208;particle level. Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the synthesis of nanocrystals (NCs) and 2D nanosheets (NSs) of layered mixed halide, Cs3Bi2I6Cl3, by solution&#8208;based method. We applied fluorescence microscopy and super&#8208;resolution optical imaging at single&#8208;particle level to investigate their morphology&#8208;dependent PL properties. Narrow emission line&#8208;widths and passivation of non&#8208;radiative defects were evidenced for 2D layered nanostructures, whereas the activation of shallow trap states was recognized at 77 K. Interestingly, individual NCs were found to display temporal intermittency (blinking) in PL emission. On the other hand, NS showed temporal PL intensity fluctuations within localized domains of the crystal.

      <title>Highly Active Homogeneous Molecular Iron Catalysts for Direct Photocatalytic Conversion of Formic Acid to Syngas (CO+H2) at Room Temperature by Visible Light</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic decomposition of formic acid to generate syngas (a mixture of H  2  and CO) is a highly valuable strategy for energy conversion.

      <title>Tuning the Properties of Graphdiyne through Introducing Electron Withdrawing/Donating Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, properties of graphdiyne (GDY) such as energy gap, conductivity, morphology, and affinity to alkalis metals are efficiently adjusted through including electron withdrawing/donating groups. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that the push&#8208;pull electron ability and size differences of groups play a key role on the property adjusting of as&#8208;prepared GDY derivatives named MeGDY, HGDY, and CNGDY. Typically, cyano group with electron withdrawing ability and methyl group with electron donating characteristic have successfully reduced the band gaps and increased the conductivity of the GDY network within an obvious range. Meanwhile, the inclusion of cyano and methyl groups affects the aggregation of GDY, thus providing a higher number of micropores and specific surface area. Moreover, the fascinating properties of these groups endow the original GDY additional advantages in following aspects: the stronger electronegativity of cyano groups increase the affinity of GDY frameworks to lithium atoms; the larger atomic volume of methyl groups increases the interlayer distance and provide more storage space and diffusion tunnels. These results provide an inspiring idea to design and synthesize novel functionalized GDY based materials for high stability, high conductivity and controllable functionality.</dc:description>

      <title>A Two&#8208;Plateaus Li&#8208;Se Chemistry for High&#8208;Volumetric&#8208;Capacity Se Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>For Li&#8208;Se batteries, ether&#8208; and carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes are commonly used. However, due to the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of the highly dissoluble long&#8208;chain lithium polyselenides (LPSes, Li  2  Se  n  , 4 &#8804;  n  &#8804; 8) in the ether electrolytes and the sluggish one&#8208;step solid&#8208;solid conversion between Se and Li  2  Se in the carbonate electrolytes, a large amount of porous carbon (&gt; 40 wt% in the electrode) is always needed for the Se cathodes, which seriously counteracts the advantage of Se electrodes in volumetric capacity. In this work, we introduce an acetonitrile&#8208;based electrolyte to the Li&#8208;Se system, and propose a two&#8208;plateaus conversion mechanism. This new Li&#8208;Se chemistry not only avoids the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; but also facilitates the conversion between Se and Li  2  Se, enabling an efficient Se cathode with high Se utilization (97%) and enhanced Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, with such designed electrolyte, a highly compact Se electrode (2.35 g  Se  cm  &#8722;3  ) with a record&#8208;breaking Se content (80 wt%) and high Se loading (8 mg cm  &#8722;2  ) is demonstrated with a superhigh volumetric energy density up to 2502 Wh L  &#8722;1  , surpassing that of LiCoO  2  .</dc:description>

This protocol provides a new route to 10&#8208;membered monocyclic architectures bearing chiral quaternary stereocenters with high chemo&#8208;, peri&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The success of this strategy relied on the facile in&#8208;situ generation of Pd&#8208;containing 1,8&#8208;dipoles and their enantioselective trapping by ketene dipolarophiles, which were formed in situ via a photo&#8208;Wolff rearrangement.</dc:description>

More importantly, enhancement in thermal properties of the branched copolymer was observed, as the Tg was increased by 22 &#176;C compared to the linear analogs. Especially, when chiral ECH was utilized, semicrystalline branched poly(monothiocarbonate)s were accessible with a Tm of 112 &#176;C, which is 40 &#176;C higher than that of the corresponding linear poly(monothiocarbonate).

Especially, when chiral ECH was utilized, semicrystalline branched poly(monothiocarbonate)s were accessible with a Tm of 112 &#176;C, which is 40 &#176;C higher than that of the corresponding linear poly(monothiocarbonate). The strategy for synthesizing branched polymers presented herein explores the methodology library for accessing topological polymers in an efficient and more concise way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Spray Coating of Catalytically Active MOF&#8208;Polythiourea through Postsynthetic Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and more specifically, organophosphorous nerve agents, are some of the most acutely toxic chemicals to humans. Despite international treaties designed to ban nerve agents, they continually resurface to cause harm to both civilian and military personnel worldwide. Herein, we report the synthesis of a UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NCS MOF from postsynthetic modification (PSM) of UiO&#8208; 66&#8208;NH 2 . The UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NCS MOF displays a ~20&#8208;fold increase in activity against the chemical warfare agent simulant dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208; nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP) compared to UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH 2 , making it the most active MOF materials as assessed using a previously validated high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method. More importantly, the &#8208;NCS functional groups provide reactive handles for postsynthetic polymerization (PSP) of these MOFs into functional materials. We show that these MOFs can be tethered to amine terminated polypropylene polymers (Jeffamines) through a facile room temperature synthesis with no byproducts. These MOFs are then crosslinked into a MOF&#8208;polythiourea (MOF&#8208;PTU) composite material that maintain the catalytic properties of the MOF and display the flexibility of the polymer. Furthermore, this MOF&#8208;PTU hybrid material was utilized as a spray coating onto Nyco textile fibers and displayed excellent adhesion to the fiber surface. Compared to physical mixture control experiments with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PTU, the covalent UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NCS&#8208;PTU spray coating shows better compatibility and durability with the Nyco fibers. The spray coated fibers were screened for the degradation of DMNP and showed durable catalytic reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Approach to Deboronative Radical Chain Reaction with Pinacol Alkylboronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>The generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from air&#8208;sensitive organoboron compounds via nucleohomolytic substitution at boron is one of the most general methods to generate non&#8208;functionalized and functionalized radicals. Due to their reduced Lewis acidity, the very popular, air&#8208;stable, and readily available alkylboronic pinacol esters are not suitable substrates for this process. Herein, is reported their  in situ  conversion to alkylboronic catechol esters by boron&#8208;transesterification with a substoichiometric amount of catechol methyl borate (MeO&#8211;Bcat) telescoped onto a wide array of radical chain processes. This simple one&#8208;pot, radical&#8208;chain, deboronative protocol allows for the conversion of pinacol boronic esters into iodides, bromides, chlorides, and thioethers. The process is also suitable the formation of nitriles and allylated compounds via C&#8211;C bond formation using sulfonyl radical traps. Finally, a particularly mild protocol for the protodeboronation of pinacol boronic esters is given. The power of combining radical and classical boron chemistry, is illustrated with a highly modular 5&#8208;membered ring formation using a combination of a three&#8208;component coupling reaction and a protodeboronative cyclization.</dc:description>

      <title>Superwetting Patterned Membranes with Anisotropy/Isotropy Transition: towards Signal Expression and Liquid Permeation</title>
      <dc:description>Superwetting membranes with responsive property have attracted heightened attention because of their fine&#8208;tunable surface wettability. However, their functional diversity is severely limited by the &#8220;black&#8208;or&#8208;white&#8221; wettability transition. Here, we develop a coating strategy to fabricate the multifunctional responsive superwetting membranes with SiO2/octadecylamine patterns. The adjustable patterns relating to the responsive region are the key factor for functional diversity. Specifically, the coated part of the membrane displays superhydrophobicity/superhydrophilicity transition under different pH values, while the uncoated part exhibits invariant superhydrophilicity, thereby endowing the membranes with anisotropic/isotropic wettability transition property. Based on the innovative anisotropy/isotropy transition, the membranes can be served as either responsive permeable membrane or signal expression membrane, thus realizing responsive liquids separation and permeation with satisfactory separation efficiency (&gt;99.90%) and flux (~60 L/m2&#183;h), as well as real&#8208;time liquid signal expression with alterable signals. The strategy successfully realizes functional diversity taking advantage of the responsive patterned membranes, which could open up a new door to design superwetting materials for flexible and space&#8208;saving applications in narrow working environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembled Helical Arrays for Stabilizing the Triplet State</title>
      <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of metal and heavy atom&#8208;free organic molecules has emerged as an area of great potential in the recent past. A rational design played a critical role in controlling the molecular ordering to impart efficient intersystem crossing and stabilize the triplet state to achieve room&#8208;temperature ultralong phosphorescence. However, in most of the cases, the strategies followed to strengthen phosphorescence efficiency have resulted in a reduced lifetime, and the available nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet energy levels impart a natural competition between delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence, with former one having the advantage. Here, an organic helical assembly supports it towards phosphorescence in this competitive pathway to exhibit an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime. In contrary to other molecules, 3,6&#8208;phenylmethanone functionalized 9&#8208;hexylcarbazole exhibits a remarkable improvement in phosphorescence lifetime (4.1 sec) and quantum yield (11 %) due to an efficient molecular packing in the crystal state.

      <dc:description>The development of novel photosensitizing agents with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties have fueled significant advances in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, electroporation method was used to prepare tumor&#8208;exocytosed exosome/AIEgen hybrid nano&#8208;vesicles (termed DES) that could facilitate efficient tumor penetration. Dexamethasone was then used to normalize vascular function within the TME to reduce local hypoxia, thereby significantly enhancing the PDT efficacy of DES nano&#8208;vesicles, allowing them to effectively inhibit tumor growth. We achieved the hybridization of AIEgen and biological tumor&#8208;exocytosed exosomes for the first time, and combine PDT approaches with normalizing the intratumoral vasculature as a means of reducing local tissue hypoxia. Together, this work highlights a new valuable approach to design AIEgen based PDT systems and underscores the potential clinical value of AIEgens.</dc:description>

      <title>The Role of Surface Termination in Halide Perovskite for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Halide perovskites have received extensive attention in the field of photocatalysis owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the semiconductor properties of halide perovskite surface and the influences on the photocatalytic performances have not been systematically clarified. Here we employ the conversion of triose (e.g. 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA)) as a model reaction to explore the surface termination of MAPbI  3  . By rational design of the surface termination for MAPbI  3  , we substantially improve the production rate of butyl lactate to 7719 &#956;g/g cat./h under visible light illumination. It reveals that MAI&#8208;terminated MAPbI  3  surface governs the photocatalytic performance. Specially, MAI&#8208;terminated surface is susceptible to iodide oxidation, which thus promotes the exposure of Pb(II) as active sites for this photocatalysis process. Moreover, MAI&#8208;termination induces p&#8208;doping effect near the surface for MAPbI  3  , which facilitates the carrier transport and thus photosynthesis. The understanding of the surface termination in MAPbI  3  photocatalyst suggests a new avenue to engineer halide perovskite semiconductor materials for future photocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts have demonstrated their superiorities over other forms of catalysts for various reactions. However, the reported nitrogen reduction reaction single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts exclusively utilize metal&#8208;nitrogen or metal&#8208;carbon coordination configurations as catalytic active sites.

The density functional theory calculations identify Fe&#8208;(O&#8208;C&#173;2)4 as the active site for nitrogen reduction reaction.

      <title>Intracellular Entropy&#8208;driven Multi&#8208;bit DNA Computing for Tumor Progression Discrimination</title>
      <dc:description>Tumor progression such as  metastasis are complicated events that involve  abnormal  expression of  different miRNAs and  enzymes. Monitoring these biomolecules in live cells with computational DNA nanotechnology may enable discrimination of tumor  progression via digital outputs. Herein, we  report intracellular  entropy&#8208;driven multivalent DNA circuits  to implement multi&#8208;bit computing  for simultaneous analysis of intracellular telomerase, and microRNAs including miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;31. These three biomolecules can trigger respective DNA strand displacement  recycling reactions for signal amplification.  They are visualized by fluorescence imaging, and their signal outputs are encoded as multi&#8208;bit binary codes for different cell types. The results can discriminate  non&#8208;tumorigenic  , malignant and  metastatic  breast cells as well as respective  tumors  . This DNA computing circuit is further performed in a microfluidic chip to differentiate rare co&#8208;cultured cells, which holds a potential for the analysis of clinical samples.</dc:description>

      <title>Independent Generation and Time&#8208;Resolved Detection of 2'&#8208;Deoxyguanosin&#8208;N2&#8208;yl Radical</title>
      <dc:description>Guanine radicals are important reactive intermediates in DNA damage. Hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;) has long been believed to react with 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine (dG) generating 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosin&#8208;  N1  &#8208;yl radical (dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226;) via addition to the nucleobase &#960;&#8208;system and subsequent dehydration. This basic tenet was challenged by an alternative mechanism, in which the major reaction of HO&#8226; with dG was proposed to involve hydrogen atom abstraction from the N2&#8208;amine. The 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosin&#8208;  N2  &#8208;yl radical (dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226;) formed was proposed to rapidly tautomerize to dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226;. We report the first independent generation of dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; in high yield via photolysis of  1  . dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; is directly observed upon nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of  1  . The absorption spectrum of dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; is corroborated by DFT studies, and  anti  &#8208; and  syn  &#8208;dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; are resolved for the first time. The LFP experiments showed no evidence for tautomerization of dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; to dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226; within hundreds of microseconds. This observation suggests that the generation of dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226; via dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; following hydrogen atom abstraction from dG is unlikely to be a major pathway when HO&#8226; reacts with dG.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Structurally complex diazo&#8208;containing scaffolds are formed by conjugate addition to vinyl diazonium salts. The electrophile, a little studied &#945;&#8208;diazonium&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound, is formed at low temperature under mild conditions by treating &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyls with Sc(OTf)  3  . Conjugate addition occurs selectively at the 3&#8208;position of indole to give &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;indole carbonyls, and enoxy silanes react to give 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products. These reactions result in the formation of tertiary and quaternary centers, and give products that would be otherwise difficult to form. Importantly, the diazo functional group is retained within the molecule for future manipulation. Treating a &#945;&#8208;diazo ester indole addition product with Rh2(OAc)4  caused a rearrangement to occur to give a 2&#8208;(1  H  &#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;enoate.

The hydroalkylation proceeds with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to form (Z)&#8208;alkenes, which are more difficult to generate, instead of (E)&#8208;alkenes.

      <dc:description>A copper&#8208;based complex that contains a sulfonate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand was first reported 15 years ago.

      <dc:description>
One for all: A high&#8208;affinity amyloid&#8208;suppressing interaction between the human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory polypeptide cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 and the key type 2 diabetes (T2D) amyloid polypeptide IAPP was identified.

Abstract
Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is linked to pancreatic inflammation, &#946;&#8208;cell degeneration, and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The multifunctional host&#8208;defence peptides (HDPs) cathelicidins play crucial roles in inflammation. Here, we show that the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory polypeptide human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 binds IAPP with nanomolar affinity and effectively suppresses its amyloid self&#8208;assembly and related pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell damage in&#8197;vitro. In addition, we identify key LL&#8208;37 segments that mediate its interaction with IAPP. Our results suggest a possible protective role for LL&#8208;37 in T2D pathogenesis and offer a molecular basis for the design of LL&#8208;37&#8208;derived peptides that combine antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and T2D&#8208;related anti&#8208;amyloid functions as promising candidates for multifunctional drugs.
