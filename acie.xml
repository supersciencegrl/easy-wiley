      <title>Controlling residual lithium in high&#8208;nickel (&gt;90 %) lithium layered oxides for cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The rampant generation of lithium hydroxide and carbonate impurities, commonly known as &#8216;residual lithium&#8217;, is a practical obstacle to the mass&#8208;scale synthesis and handling of high&#8208;nickel (&gt;90%) layered oxides and their use as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we suggest a simple  in situ  method to control the residual lithium chemistry of a high&#8208;nickel lithium layered oxide, Li(Ni  0.91  Co  0.06  Mn  0.03  )O  2  (NCM9163), with minimal side effects. Based on thermodynamic considerations of the preferred reactions, we systematically designed a synthesis process that preemptively converts residual Li  2  O (the origin of LiOH and Li  2  CO  3  ) into a more stable compound by injecting reactive SO  2  gas. The preformed lithium sulfate thin film significantly suppresses the generation of LiOH and Li  2  CO  3  during both synthesis and storage, thereby mitigating slurry gelation and gas evolution and improving the cycle stability. This simple and versatile approach is thus a promising practical solution to overcome the residual lithium issues currently encountered on mass production lines.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatially Responsive Multicolor Lanthanide&#8208;MOFs Heterostructures for Covert Photonic Barcodes</title>
      <dc:description>Micro/nanoscale photonic barcodes based on multicolor luminescent segmented heterojunctions hold exotic potential applications in information security. However, such multicolor heterojunctions reported thus far are exclusively based on static luminescent signals, thus restraining their application in advanced confidential information protection. Here, we report on a strategy to design responsive photonic barcodes with heterobimetallic (Tb  3+  /Eu  3+  ) MOFs multicolor heterostructures. The spatial colors could be precisely controlled by thermally manipulating the energy transfer process between the two lanthanides, thus allowing for achieving responsive covert photonic barcodes. We further demonstrate that spatially&#8208;resolved responsive barcodes with multi&#8208;responsive features could be created in a single heterostructure. These findings offer unique opportunities to purposely design highly integrated responsive microstructures and smart devices toward advanced anticounterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Iodine&#8208;transfer polymerization (ITP) of ethylene and copolymerization with vinyl acetate</title>
      <dc:description>The first example of a controlled radical polymerization of ethylene using iodine transfer polymerization (ITP) is performed under mild conditions (&#8804;&#160;100 &#176;C and &#8804; 200 bar). Different commercially available, cheap, and non&#8208;toxic iodo alkyls (R&#8208;I) were used as chain&#8208;transfer agents (CTAs) in combination with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azobis(2&#8208;methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) to investigate the impact of the R&#8208;group on the polymerization behaviour. These systems showed no rate retardation and no significant loss of chain ends. The formed well&#8208;defined end&#8208;capped polyethylene&#8211;iodine (PE&#8211;I) species is very stable upon storage. Molar&#8208;mass distributions with dispersities around 1.6 were obtained up to number average molar masses  M  n  of 7300 g&#160;mol  &#8208;1  . The copolymerization by ITP (ITcoP) of ethylene with vinyl acetate (VAc) to form poly(ethylene&#8208;&#160;  co&#160;  &#8208;vinyl acetate) (EVA) copolymer&#160; was also successful. By fine tuning the ethylene pressure and the vinyl acetate content, a broad range of copolymers containing from 0 to 85 mol% of VAc unit was achieved. By reactivating the iodo chain&#8208;end, block copolymer structures composed of ethylene and VAc such as poly(ethylene&#8208;  co  &#8208;vinyl acetate)&#8208;  b  &#8208;polyethylene (EVA&#8208;  b  &#8208;PE) or gradient block copopolymers EVA&#8208;  b  &#8208;EVA with different content of VAc in the blocks were obtained for the first time using ITP. This highly versatile synthetic platform provides a straightforward access to a diverse range of well&#8208;defined PE based polymer materials.

Through an alternate evolutionary trajectory, a stereodivergent biocatalyst was also obtained for affording mirror&#8208;image forms of the desired bicyclic products. In combination with whole&#8208;cell transformations, the myoglobin&#8208;based biocatalyst was readily applied to enable the asymmetric construction of a cyclopropyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactone scaffold at a gram scale.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Mono&#8208;Selective &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acetone with Aryl Chlorides and Phenol Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>The challenging nickel&#8208;catalyzed mono &#945;&#8208;arylation of acetone with aryl chlorides, pivalates and carbamates has been achieved for the first time. A nickel/Josiphos&#8208;based catalytic system is shown to feature unique catalytic behavior allowing highly selective formation of the desired mono &#945;&#8208;arylated acetone. The developed methodology was applied to a variety of (hetero)aryl chlorides including biologically relevant derivatives. The methodology has been extended to the unprecedented coupling of acetone with phenol derivatives. Mechanistic studies allowed the isolation and characterization of key Ni(0) and Ni(II) catalytic intermediates. The Josiphos ligand is shown to play a key role in the stabilization of Ni(II) intermediates to allow a Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalytic pathway. Mechanistic understanding was then leveraged to improve the protocol using an air&#8208;stable Ni(II) pre&#8208;catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Halogenation for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting: Small Changes Make Big Differences</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs), which is an emerging class of crystalline porous polymers, have been recognized as a new platform for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy conversion owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures and tailor&#8208;made functions. Herein, we demonstrate that slight modulation of the chemical structure of a typical photoactive 2D COF (Py&#8208;HTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF)  via  chlorination (Py&#8208;ClTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) and fluorination (Py&#8208;FTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) can lead to dramatically enhanced photocatalytic    H  2  evolution rates  (HER = 177.50 &#956;mol&#8201;h  &#8208;1  with a high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 8.45% for Py&#8208;ClTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF). Both experimental and computational studies reveal that halogen modulation at the photoactive benzothiadiazole moiety can efficiently suppress charge recombination and significantly reduce the energy barrier associated with the formation of H intermediate species (H*)  on polymer surface  . Our findings provide new prospects toward design and synthesis of highly active organic photocatalysts toward solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling CO2 hydrogenation selectivity by metal&#8208;support electron transfer under reaction conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Tuning CO 2  hydrogenation selectivity to obtain targeted value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels has attracted great yet ever&#8208;increasing attention. However, a fundamental understanding of the nature to control the selectivity is still lacking, posing a challenge in catalyst design and development. Here, we report our new discovery in ambient pressure CO 2  hydrogenation reaction where selectivity can be completely reversed by simply changing the crystal phases of TiO 2  support (anatase &#8208; or rutile&#8208;TiO 2  ) or changing metal loadings on anatase&#8208;TiO 2  . Operando spectroscopy and NAP&#8208;XPS studies reveal the determining factor is electron transfer from metal to support under reaction conditions most probably caused by hydrogen spillover, which changes the adsorption and activation of the intermediate of CO. Based on this new finding, we can not only regulate CO 2  hydrogenation selectivity but also tune catalytic performance in other important reactions, thus opening up a door for efficient catalyst development by rational design.</dc:description>

      <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide in Metallic Nanopores through a Pincer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Metallic catalysts with nanopores are advantageous on improving both activity and selectivity, while the reason behind that remains unclear all along. In this work, porous Zn nanoparticles (P&#8208;Zn) were adopted as a model catalyst to investigate the catalytic behavior of metallic nanopores. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that the concave surface of nanopores works like a pincer to capture and clamp CO  2  and H  2  O precursors simultaneously, thus lowering the energy barriers of CO  2  electroreduction. Resultantly, the pincer mechanism endows P&#8208;Zn with a high Faradic efficiency (98.1%) towards CO production at the potential of &#8208;0.95 V vs. RHE. Moreover, DFT calculation demonstrates that Co and Cu nanopores exhibit the pincer behavior as well, suggesting that this mechanism is universal for metallic nanopores.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Activity and Stability Origin of BiVO4 Photoanodes with FeNi Oxyhydroxides for Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the origin of formation and active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalysts is highly required for solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices that generate hydrogen efficiently from water. Herein, we employed a simple pH&#8208;modulated method for in&#8208;situ growth of FeNi oxyhydroxide ultrathin&#8208;layers on BiVO 4  photoanodes, resulting in one of the highest currently known PEC activities of 5.8 mA&#8201;cm &#8722;2  (1.23 V RHE  , AM 1.5G) accompanied with an excellent stability. More importantly, both comparative experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies clearly reveal that the selective formation of Bi&#8208;O&#8208;Fe interfacial bonds mainly contributes the enhanced OER activities, while the construction of V&#8208;O&#8208;Ni interfacial bonds effectively restrains the dissolution of V 5+  ions and promotes the OER stability. Thereby, the synergy between iron and nickel of FeNi oxyhydroxides significantly improved the PEC water oxidation properties of BiVO 4  photoanodes. These results offer the unique insights into the crucial roles of bimetallic OER cocatalysts, which have significant implications for the design and construction of highly efficient PEC devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Intense Red&#8208;Blue Luminescence Based on Superfine Control of Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions for Self&#8208;Assembled Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A series of assembled Pt(II) complexes comprising N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and cyanide ligands was constructed using different substituent groups, [Pt(CN)2(R&#8208;impy)] (R&#8208;impyH+  = 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazolium, R = Me (Pt&#8208;Me), Et (Pt&#8208;Et),  iPr (Pt&#8208;  iPr), and  tBu (Pt&#8208;  tBu  )). All the complexes exhibited highly efficient photoluminescence with an emission quantum yield of 0.51&#8211;0.81 in the solid state at room temperature, originating from the triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) state.

      <title>A Generalizable and Noncovalent Strategy of Interfacing Aptamers with Microelectrode for Selective Sensing of Neurotransmitter In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Selective probing of neurochemicals is essential for understanding the chemical basis of brain function and pathology. To this aim, interfacing excellent recognition features of aptamers with in vivo compatible carbon fiber microelectrode (CFE)&#8208;based electroanalytical system offers a plausible means, however, is significantly challenged in terms of coupling chemistry, stability, and versatility. Here, we present a new interfacial functionalization strategy created through the assembly of aptamer cholesterol amphiphiles (aptCAs) onto the alkyl chain&#8208;functionalized CFE. We show that the noncovalent cholesterol&#8208;alkyl chain interactions are capable of effectively immobilizing aptamers onto CFE surface. Moreover, the strategy is generalizable, facile, and applicable of synergizing the merits of microelectrode and aptamers, allowing the generation of a highly selective bioelectronic system for probing neurochemical dynamics in living systems. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of using noncovalent cholesterol&#8208;based anchoring of aptamers to carbon&#8208;based electrodes, opening up a vast array of new opportunities for designing in vivo sensors to exploring brain chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>In vitro reconstitution reveals a central role for the N&#8208;oxygenase PvfB in (dihydro)pyrazine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide and valdiazen biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The  Pseudomonas virulence factor  (  pvf  ) operon is essential for the biosynthesis of two very different natural product scaffolds: the (dihydro)pyrazine&#8208;  N&#8208;  oxides and the diazeniumdiolate, valdiazen.

In contrast, we show that PvfB catalyzes  N&#8208;  oxygenation of the &#945;&#8208;amine of valine, first to the hydroxylamine and then the nitroso, while linked to the carrier protein of PvfC. PvfB modification of PvfC&#8208;tethered valine was observed directly by protein NMR, establishing the intermediacy of the hydroxylamine.

      <title>Cobalt Nanoparticles&#8208;Catalyzed Widely Applicable Successive C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage in Alcohols to Access Esters</title>
      <dc:description>Selective cleavage and functionalization of C&#8208;C bonds have important applications in organic synthesis and biomass utilization. However, functionalization of C&#8208;C bonds by controlled cleavage remains difficult and challenging because they are inert. Herein, we describe an unprecedented efficient protocol for the breaking of successive C&#8208;C bonds in alcohols to form esters with one or multiple carbon atoms less using heterogeneous cobalt nanoparticles catalyst with dioxygen as the oxidant. A wide range of alcohols including inactive long&#8208;chain alkyl aryl alcohols undergo smoothly successive cleavage of adjacent &#8208;(C&#8208;C)n&#8208; bonds to afford the corresponding esters. The catalyst was used for seven times without any decrease in activity. Characterization and control experiments disclose that cobalt nanoparticles are responsible for the successive cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds to achieve excellent catalytic activity, while the presence of Co&#8208;N  x  has just the opposite effect. Preliminary mechanistic reveals that a tandem sequence reaction is involved in this process.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiple&#8208;Color Platinum Complex with Super&#8208;Large Stokes Shift for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Autolysosome Escape</title>
      <dc:description>It is of great significance to track the platinum drugs in real time with super&#8208;resolution to elucidate their mechanism of action, such as their behavior and distribution in live cells, for drug development. However, it is always challenging to design  platinum complexes suitable for such research. Here, we design a  luminescent  building block (  L  ) for metal complexes and a dinuclear platinum complex (  Pt  2  L  ) for super&#8208;resolution imaging. Because of its super&#8208;large Stokes shift and excellent photophysical properties,  Pt  2  L  is capable of serving as an ideal candidate for super&#8208;resolution imaging with extremely low luminescence background and high photobleaching resistance. Moreover, upon light stimulation, a matter flux of  Pt  2  L  escaping from autolysosomes to nucleus was observed, which represents a new transportation path. Utilizing the photoactivated escape properties, we can regulate the nuclear accessibility of  Pt  2  L  form autolysosomes with photo&#8208;selectivity, which provides a new way to improve the targeting of platinum drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Pendant Alkoxy Groups on N&#8208;Aryl Substitutions Drive the Efficiency of Imidazolylidene Catalysts for Homoenolate Annulation from Enal and Aldehyde</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate generated from an imidazolylidene catalyst and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde forms a conjugated Breslow intermediate. This is a critical step affecting the efficiency of the NHC&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone formation via homoenolate addition to aryl aldehydes. A novel type of imidazolylidene catalyst with pendant alkoxy groups on the ortho&#8208;N&#8208;aryl groups is described.

      <title>Ferroelectricity&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection with Strong Polarization&#8208;Sensitivity in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Hybrid Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>Polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet (UV) photodetection is highly indispensable in military and civilian applications and has been demonstrated with various wide&#8208;band photodetectors. However, it still remains elusive to achieve the self&#8208;powered devices, which can be operated in the absence of external bias. Herein, for the first time, ferroelectricity&#8208;driven self&#8208;powered photodetection towards polarized UV light was successfully demonstrated in a 2D wide&#8208;bandgap hybrid ferroelectric (BPA)  2  PbBr  4  (BPA = 3&#8208;bromopropylammonium) (  1  ). We found that the prominent spontaneous polarization in  1  results in a bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of 0.85 V, that independently drives photoexcited carriers separation and transport and thus supports self&#8208;powered ability. Emphatically, this self&#8208;powered detector show a strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity to the linearly polarized UV illumination with an impressive polarization ratio up to 6. 8, which is greatly superior to that of previously reported UV&#8208;polarized photodetectors (  e.g.  ZnO, GaN and GeS  2  ). As pioneering work, this work presents a paradigm for achieving self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection with strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity by integrating ferroelectricity into hybrid halide perovskites.</dc:description>

Emphatically, this self&#8208;powered detector show a strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity to the linearly polarized UV illumination with an impressive polarization ratio up to 6. 8, which is greatly superior to that of previously reported UV&#8208;polarized photodetectors (  e.g.  ZnO, GaN and GeS  2  ). As pioneering work, this work presents a paradigm for achieving self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodetection with strong polarization&#8208;sensitivity by integrating ferroelectricity into hybrid halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE): A Historical Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
An old phenomenon in a new light: In this brief Essay, the currently highly recognized aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomenon is discussed in a broader perspective by illustrating its roots in earlier work.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) has attracted considerable interest over the last twenty years. In contrast to the large number of available reviews focusing specifically on AIE, this Essay discusses the AIE phenomenon from a broader perspective, with an emphasis on early observations related to AIE made long before the term was coined. Illustrative examples are highlighted from the 20th century where fluorescence enhancement upon rigidification of dyes in viscous or solid environments or J&#8208;aggregate formation was studied. It is shown that these examples already include typical AIE luminogens such as tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as well as stilbenes and oligo&#8208; or polyphenylenevinylenes and &#8208;ethynylenes, which became important fluorescent solid&#8208;state materials in OLED research in the 1990s. Further examples include cyanine dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) or its dimers (TOTOs), which have been widely applied as molecular probes in nucleic acid research. The up to 10&#8201;000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement of such dyes upon intercalation into double&#8208;stranded DNA, attributable to the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) concept, afforded commercial products for bioimaging and fluorescence sensing applications already in the early 1990s.

      <title>A Synergistic Enhancement Strategy for Realizing Ultralong and Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Reported here is a synergistic enhancement strategy for realizing ultralong bright room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), involving polymerization between phosphor monomers and acrylamide and host&#8208;guest complexation interaction between phosphors and  cucurbit[6, 7, 8]urils  (CB[6, 7, 8]). The non&#8208;phosphorescent monomers exhibit 2.46 s ultralong lifetime after copolymerizing with acrylamide. The immense improvement is because of the rich hydrogen bond and carbonyl within the polymers which promote intersystem crossing (ISC), suppress nonradiative relaxation and shield quenchers effectively. By tuning the ratio of chromophores, a series of phosphorescent copolymers with different lifetimes and quantum yields are prepared. Significantly, the complexation of macrocyclic hosts CB[6, 7, 8] promote the RTP of polymers by blocking aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), and offsetting the losses of aforementioned interaction provided by polymer. Moreover, multiple lifetime&#8208;encoding for digit and character encryption are achieved by utilizing the difference of their lifetimes, demonstrating great potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This synergistic enhancement strategy provides a new approach for realizing high&#8208;performance RTP.</dc:description>

      <title>Designing AI&#8208;aided analysis and prediction models for nonprecious metal electrocatalyst&#8208;based proton exchange membrane fuel cells</title>
      <dc:description>Traditionally, lots of experiments are needed to optimize the performance of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) since it involves complex electrochemical, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic processes. Herein, we introduce artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;aided models for the first time to determine key parameters for nonprecious metal electrocatalyst&#8208;based PEMFC, thus reducing unnecessary experiments during MEA development. Among 16 competing algorithms widely applied in the AI field, decision tree and XGBoost showed good accuracy (86.7% and 91.4%) in determining key factors for high&#8208;performance MEA. Artificial neural network (ANN) shows the best accuracy (R2=0.9621) in terms of predictions of the maximum power density and a decent reproducibility (R2&gt;0.99) on uncharted I&#8208;V polarization curves with 26 input features. Hence, machine learning has been proved to be an excellent method in improving the efficiency of MEA design and experiment.</dc:description>

      <title>Acid&#8208;Base Free Main Group Carbonyl Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonyl compounds (R  2  C=O) are cornerstones of organic chemistry. In sharp contrast, main group carbonyl analogues (R  2  E=O) derived from  p  &#8208;block elements from groups 13 to 15, have long been considered to be elusive species. Employment of chemical tricks such as acid/base stabilization protocols granted access to these transient species in their masked forms. However, electronic and steric effects inevitably perturb their chemical reactivity and distinguish them from classical carbonyl compounds. A new era was marked by the recent isolation of acid&#8208;base (i.e. acid and base) free main group carbonyl analogues, ranging from a lighter boracarbonyl to the heavier silacarbonyls, phosphacarbonyls and a germacarbonyl. Most importantly, the rich chemistry of these unperturbed main group carbonyl compounds has begun to emerge, spanning the vista from classical organic carbonyl&#8208;type reactions to transition metal&#8208;like oxide ion transfer chemistry. The anionic nature of boracarbonyl can be employed to make a strong donor ligand while the cationic phosphacarbonyl exhibits potent Lewis acidity. On the other hand, neutral sila/germacarbonyls display more ambiphilic behaviour. In this review, we survey the strategies used for the isolation of such systems and document their emerging reactivity profiles, with a view to providing fundamental comparisons both with carbon and transition metal oxo species. This highlights the emerging opportunities for exciting &#8216;crossover&#8217; reactivity offered by these derivatives of the  p  &#8208;block elements.</dc:description>

      <title>Evolution of the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Mechanism Since the 1930s:
Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions</title>
      <dc:description>The first Cope Award was presented in 1973 to R. B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann (the only shared Cope Award). In his award lecture, Woodward described his fascination in his early teens with the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Beginning in the late 1930s with his B.S. and Ph.D. theses and extending throughout his career, Woodward studied the mechanism of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and used it extensively in his total syntheses. This article describes the evolution of Woodward&#8217;s mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8208;Katz two&#8208;stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. There was much debate in the chemical literature about the validity of Woodward&#8217;s early mechanisms, especially with Michael Dewar. However, as discussed in this paper, many of Woodward&#8217;s mechanistic hypotheses have turned out to be valid. Modern calculations with quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Woodward indeed had perfectly described not only the cyclopentadiene dimerization mechanism, but a new class of transition states now known as ambimodal or bis&#8208;pericyclic transition states. This mechanistic type was first discovered in 2002 by the late Pierluigi Caramella from Pavia, Italy. In recent years, the Houk group has found that ambimodal reactions are operative in the [6+4] cycloaddition that Woodward and Hoffmann predicted in 1965, and that Houk studied experimentally as a graduate student. Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8208;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions, in solvents and in enzymes, provide a time&#8208;resolved picture of how Woodward&#8217;s favorite reactions occur. &#160; Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward&#8217;s youth to today&#8217;s trajectory simulations.</dc:description>

      <title>Imidazole&#8208;based Synthetic Lipidoids for In Vivo mRNA Delivery into Primary T Lymphocytes</title>
      <dc:description>Engineering T lymphocytes is an emerging approach in a variety of biomedical applications.

In this paper, we investigated a library of synthetic lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) for their capability of delivering mRNA into primary T lymphocytes both  ex vivo  and  in vivo  . We initially conducted a library screening with large structural variety of lipidoids  ex vivo  and identified imidazole&#8208;containing lipidoids that are particularly potent in T lymphocytes transfection. We further optimized lipidoid structures through constructing and screening a detailed lipidoid library containing imidazole or imidazole analogues to perform a structure&#8208;activity correlation analysis.

      <title>Proapoptotic Peptide Brush Polymer Nanoparticles via Photoinitiated Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (photo&#8208;PISA) of spherical micelles consisting of proapoptotic peptide&#8208;polymer amphiphiles. The one&#8208;pot synthetic approach yielded micellar nanoparticles at high concentrations and at scale (150 mg/mL) with tunable peptide loadings up to 48 wt. %. The size of the micellar nanoparticles was tuned by varying the lengths of hydrophobic and hydrophilic building blocks. Critically, the peptide&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles imbued the proapoptotic &#8220;KLA&#8221; peptides (amino acid sequence: KLAKLAKKLAKLAK) with two key properties otherwise not inherent to the sequence: 1) proteolytic resistance compared to the oligopeptide alone; 2) significantly enhanced cell uptake permeability by multivalent display of KLA peptide brushes. The result was demonstrated improved apoptosis efficiency in HeLa cells. These results highlight the potential of photo&#8208;PISA in the large&#8208;scale synthesis of functional, proteolytically resistant peptide&#8208;polymer conjugates for intracellular delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Rigid Arrangements of Ionic Charge in Zeolite Frameworks Conferred by Specific Al Distributions Preferentially Stabilize Alkanol Dehydration Transition States</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolite reactivity depends on the solvating environments of their micropores and the proximity of their Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Turnover rates (per H+) for methanol and ethanol dehydration increase with the fraction of H+ sites sharing six&#8208;membered rings of chabazite (CHA) zeolites.

Certain Al distributions yield rigid arrangements of anionic charge that stabilize cationic intermediates and transition states via H&#8208;bonding to decrease barriers. This is a key feature of acid catalysis in zeolite solvents, which lack the isotropy of liquid solvents. The sensitivity of polar transition states to specific arrangements of charge in their solvating environments and the ability to position such charges in zeolite lattices with increasing precision herald rich catalytic diversity among zeolites of varying Al arrangement.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;Phase Chemistry The fleeting existence of [V2O]+ as a reactive intermediate in the oxidation of [V2]+ by CO2 is described by J. Li, H. Schwarz et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;12308. The counterintuitive oxidation behavior of [V2]+ can be traced back to the supportive role of the bridging oxygen atom in [V2O]+.

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Mineral Respiration: How Iron Hemes Synchronize Electron Transfer Rates</title>
      <dc:description>
The bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens requires extracellular metal salts for respiration. Each microorganism produces 5&#215;105 electrons per second, which reduce the metal ions bound to the outer membrane cytochromes. With iron heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes, the electron flow is independent of the concentration and type of oxidant. This results in ATP homeostasis.







Abstract
Anaerobic microorganisms of the Geobacter genus are effective electron sources for the synthesis of nanoparticles, for bioremediation of polluted water, and for the production of electricity in fuel cells. In multistep reactions, electrons are transferred via iron/heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes from the inner cell membrane to extracellular metal ions, which are bound to outer membrane cytochromes. We measured electron production and electron flux rates to 5&#215;105&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1 per G.&#8197;sulfurreducens. Remarkably, these rates are independent of the oxidants, and follow zero order kinetics. It turned out that the microorganisms regulate electron flux rates by increasing their Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in the multiheme cytochromes whenever the activity of the extracellular metal oxidants is diminished. By this mechanism the respiration remains constant even when oxidizing conditions are changing. This homeostasis is a vital condition for living systems, and makes G.&#8197;sulfurreducens a versatile electron source.

Miniaturization and acceleration of synthetic chemistry is an emerging area in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials research and development. Herein, we describe the synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi&#8208;3&#8208;component reaction. We used I&#8208;DOT, a positive&#8208;pressure&#8208;based low&#8208;volume and non&#8208;contact dispensing technology to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. In general, the reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups. We exemplify a pipeline of fast and efficient nanomole&#8208;scale scouting to millimole&#8208;scale synthesis for the discovery of a useful novel reaction with great scope.

By the functionalization of perylene core with several polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) cages, our strategy successfully achieves spherical assemblies of PBIs, instead of columnar assemblies, due to the significantly increased steric hindrance at the periphery.

      <dc:description>Spatial organization of electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) supramolecular assembly is critical to the photophysical processes involved in solar energy conversion systems. Subtle variation in geometry, i.e. D&#8208;A distance and transition dipole arrangement can influence kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer (ET) process. To acquire an insight into the structure&#8208;function correlation, making of modular, crystalline materials is advantageous. In this regard, we demonstrate a redox&#8208;active, crystalline D&#8208;A assembly, in which ET process can be reversibly switched. This ET process, induced by a guest&#8208;responsive structural transformation at room temperature, is realized in a porous, metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), having anthracene (D) &#8211; naphthalenediimide (A) as struts. A control MOF structure obtained by solvent&#8208;assisted linker exchange (SALE) method, replacing acceptor strut with a neutral one, supported the switchable electronic states in D&#8208;A MOF. Combined investigations with X&#8208;ray diffraction, spectroscopic and theoretical analyses revealed the dynamic metal paddle&#8208;wheel node as a critical unit for controlling structural flexibility and corresponding unprecedented ET process.</dc:description>

      <title>Universal Access to Two&#8208;Dimensional Mesoporous Heterostructures via Micelle&#8208;Directed Interfacial Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) mesoporous heterostructures combining ultrathin nanosheet morphology, periodic porous surface structures and diverse hybrid compositions have recently emerged and become increasingly important for renewable energy storage and electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to develop a universal method to prepare 2D mesoporous heterostructures. Here, we report a composite micelle&#8208;directed interfacial assembly method to synthesize vertical heterostructures with ultrathin 2D material and two surrounding mesoporous monolayers assembled on both sides. To demonstrate the concept, we first fabricate a new sandwich&#8208;like carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructure through self&#8208;assembly of MXene nanosheets and block copolymer F127/melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin composite micelles as well as a subsequent thermal treatment. We also show that this approach can be applied to other 2D materials (for example, graphene oxide, potassium niobate nanosheets, and zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Finally, we demonstrate that the carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructured nanosheets manifest remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance as cathode for lithium sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergy of Electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions in the Realization of Nanoscale Artificial Photosynthetic Model Systems</title>
      <dc:description>In the scientific race to build up photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems with increasing efficiencies, little is known about the interplay of their building blocks when integrated into supramolecular nanoscale arrays, particularly in aqueous environments. Here, we describe an aqueous donor&#8208;acceptor ensemble whose emergence as a nanoscale material renders it remarkably stable and efficient. We have focused on a tetracationic zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) featuring pyrenes, which shows an unprecedented mode of aggregation, driven by subtle cooperation between electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our studies demonstrate monocrystalline growth in solution and a symmetry&#8208;breaking intermolecular charge transfer between adjacent ZnPcs upon photoexcitation. Immobilizing a negatively charged fullerene (C  60  ) as electron acceptor onto the monocrystalline ZnPc assemblies was found to enhance the overall stability, and to suppress the energy&#8208;wasting charge recombination found in the absence of C  60  . Overall, the resulting artificial photosynthetic model system exhibits a high degree of preorganization, which facilitates efficient charge separation and subsequent charge transport.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic Insights into Aluminium&#8208;Ion Insertion in Defective Anatase for Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aluminium batteries constitute a safe and sustainable high&#8211;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy&#8208;storage solution. Viable Al&#8208;ion batteries require suitable electrode materials that can readily intercalate high&#8208;charge Al  3+  ions. Here, we investigate the Al  3+  intercalation chemistry of anatase TiO  2  and how chemical modifications influence the accommodation of Al  3+  ions. We use fluoride&#8208; and hydroxide&#8208;doping to generate high concentrations of titanium vacancies. The coexistence of these hetero&#8208;anions and titanium vacancies leads to a complex insertion mechanism, attributed to three distinct types of host sites: native interstitials sites, single vacancy sites, and paired vacancy sites. We demonstrate that Al  3+  induces a strong local distortion within the modified TiO  2  structure, which affects the insertion properties of the neighbouring host sites. Overall, specific structural features induced by the intercalation of highly&#8208;polarizing Al  3+  ions should be considered when designing new electrode materials for multivalent batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Polar Oxynitrides: Hexagonal Perovskite BaWON2</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar compounds have important technological properties. Reported perovskite oxynitrides show centrosymmetric structures and for some of them high permittivities have been observed, ascribed to local dipoles induced by partial order of nitride and oxide. Here we report the first hexagonal perovskite oxynitride BaWON2, that shows a polar 6H polytype. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction, and annular bright&#8208;field in scanning transmission electron microscopy indicate that it crystalizes in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc, with total order of nitride and oxide at two distinct coordination environments in cubic and hexagonal packed BaX3 layers. Synergetic second order Jahn&#8208;Teller effect supported by first principle calculations, anion order and electrostatic repulsion between W6+ cations induce large distortions at two inequivalent face sharing octahedra that lead to long&#8208;range ordered dipoles and spontaneous polarization along the c axis. The new oxynitride is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.1 eV and a large permittivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Peptide&#8208;conjugated long&#8208;lived theranostic imaging toolbox for targeting GRPr in cancer and immune cells</title>
      <dc:description>Gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) plays proliferative and inflammatory roles in living systems. Here, we report a highly selective GRPr antagonist (JMV594)&#8208;tethered iridium(III) complex for probing GRPr in living cancer cells and immune cells. This probe not only exhibited desirable photophysical properties, but also displayed negligible cytotoxicity, overcoming the inherent toxicity of the iridium(III) complex. In particular, its long emission lifetime enabled its luminescence signal to be readily distinguished from the interfering fluorescence of organic dyes by using a time&#8208;resolved technique. This probe selectively visualized living cancer cells via specific binding to GRPr, while it also modulated the function of GRPr on TNF&#8208;&#945; secretion in immune cells. To our knowledge, this is the first peptide&#8208;conjugated iridium(III) complex developed as a GRPr bioimaging probe and modulator of GRPr activity. This theranostic agent shows great potential at unmasking the diverse roles of GRPr in living systems.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ultrastable, Small {Ag7}5+ Nanocluster within a Triangular Hollow Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
You got the silver: An ultrastable, small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster was synthesized within an unprecedented triangular hollow polyoxometalate (POM) framework [Si3W27O96]18&#8722;. The cluster showed unique {Ag7}5+&#8208;to&#8208;POM charge transfer bands in both visible&#8208; and UV&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Small Agn nanoclusters (n&lt;10) have been emerging as promising materials as sensing, biolabeling, and catalysis because of their unique electronic states and optical properties. However, studying synthesis, structure determination, and exploration of their properties remain major challenges as a result of the low stability of small Ag nanoclusters. Herein, we synthesized an atomically precise face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic&#8208;type small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster supported by a novel triangular hollow polyoxometalate (POM) framework [Si3W27O96]18&#8722;. The cluster showed unique {Ag7}5+&#8208;to&#8208;POM charge transfer bands in both visible and UV light regions. Furthermore, this small {Ag7}5+ nanocluster exhibited an unprecedented ultrastability in solution, despite having exposed Ag sites that can be accessed by small molecules, such as O2, water, and solvents.
