         <title>Cubic Iodide LixYI3+x Superionic Conductors through Defect Manipulation for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. &#160;Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide solid electrolytes receiving less attention.&#160; Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. &#160;Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x = 2, 3, 4, or 9). &#160;Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. &#160;By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#8451; for Li4YI7.&#160; Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. &#160;Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both 1 and its tetracation (14+&#183;4SbF6&#8208;) exhibit a nearly planar conformation with a rectangular shape, akin to the E,Z,E,Z,Z&#8208;[10]annulene. In contrast, the radical cation (1&#8226;+&#183;SbCl6&#8208;) possesses a doubly twisted H&#252;ckel topology. Furthermore, the dication (12+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) displays conformational flexibility in solution and crystalizes with the simultaneous presence of M&#246;bius&#8208;twisted (1a2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) and H&#252;ckel&#8208;planar (1b2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) isomers in its unit cell. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: (1) 1 demonstrates localized aromaticity with an alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure; (2) 1a2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208; and 1b2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208; with 48&#960; electrons are weakly M&#246;bius aromatic and H&#252;ckel antiaromatic, respectively; (3) 14+&#183;4SbF6&#8208; exhibits H&#252;ckel aromaticity (46&#960;) and open&#8208;shell diradical character.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8208;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8208;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8208;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8208;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8208;COFs into BO&#8208;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8208;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659 nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Position of Ester Group on N&#8208;Alkyl Chains of Benzotriazole&#8208;based Small Molecule Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Side chain engineering plays a vital role in exploring high&#8208;performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type SMAs by introducing different N&#8208;substituted alkyl and ester alkyl side chains on benzotriazole (BZ) central unit and aimed to investigate the effect of different ester substitution positions on photovoltaic performances. All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue&#8208;shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain&#8208;based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long&#8208;lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6:BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ&#8208;core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Rhodium (III) Complexes in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photothermal Heterogeneous C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although photocatalytic C&#8208;H activation has been realized by using heterogeneous catalysts, most of them require high&#8208;temperature conditions to provide the energy required for C&#8208;H bond breakage. The catalysts with photothermal conversion properties can catalyze this reaction efficiently at room temperature, but so far, these catalysts have been rarely developed. Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh&#8208;COF&#8208;316 and &#8208;318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition&#8208;metal catalytic moiety using a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The Rh&#8208;COF enable the heterogeneous C&#8208;H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling at room temperature. The excellent performances can be attributed to the COF&#8208;316, which enhances the photothermal effect (&#916;T = 50.9 oC), thus accelerating C&#8208;H bond activation and the exchange of catalyst with substrates.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although photocatalytic C-H activation has been realized by using heterogeneous catalysts, most of them require high-temperature conditions to provide the energy required for C-H bond breakage. The catalysts with photothermal conversion properties can catalyze this reaction efficiently at room temperature, but so far, these catalysts have been rarely developed. Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh-COF-316 and -318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition-metal catalytic moiety using a post-synthetic approach. The Rh-COF enable the heterogeneous C-H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp2)-C(sp2) coupling at room temperature.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Incarnatapeptins A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B, two novel marine natural products, was accomplished from readily available (S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyloxycarbonylhexahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid. This route, whose longest linear sequence was 12 steps, provided the incarnatapeptins A and B in yields of 26.5% and 19.7%, respectively, and enabled the structure and stereochemistry of both natural products to be unambiguously confirmed. Highlights of our synthesis include the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and a novel and practical N&#8208;acylation paradigm promoted by silver carbonate. The unusual facile atropisomerism of some linear peptidic intermediates was also observed by TLC analysis in the course of this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Oxidation Embellishing Strategy Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) has attracted extensive studies as a promising photovoltaic technology, wherein the electron extraction and transfer exhibit pivotal effect to the device performance. The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed the recent record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero&#8208;SCs, yet still suffers from surface defects of SnO2 nanoparticles which brings energy loss and phase instability. Herein, we report a localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on the SnO2 ETL. The LOE strategy builds up plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 and the nano&#8208;heterojunctions compensate the surface defects and realize benign energy alignment, which reduces surface non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss of the pero&#8208;SCs. Meanwhile, the decrease of lattice mismatch released the lattice distortion and eliminated tensile stress, contributing to better stability of the devices. The pero&#8208;SCs based on &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with the SnO2 ETL treated by the LOE strategy realized a PCE of 25.72% (certified as 25.41%), along with eminent stability performance of T90&gt;700 h. This work provides a brand&#8208;new view for defect modification of SnO2 electron transport layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Highly Robust Full&#8208;Color Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Stable White Organic Afterglow from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7% and 4.83 s under ambient conditions, respectively. For the coronene&#8208;doped sample, its afterglow color was linearly tunable between yellow and blue by temperature, and it could still emit intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68 s at 440 K. Moreover, the films showed bright and stable white afterglow at 370 K with a lifetime of 2.80 s and maintained excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150 days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Radical Addition Guides Selective Photocatalytic Intermolecular Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Ene Molecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of modern organic chemistry, harnessing the power of multicomponent radical reactions presents both significant challenges and extraordinary potential. This article delves into this scientific frontier by addressing the critical issue of controlling selectivity in such complex processes. We introduce a novel approach that revolves around the reversible addition of thiyl radicals to multiple bonds, reshaping the landscape of multicomponent radical reactions. The key to selectivity lies in the intricate interplay between reversibility and the energy landscapes governing C&#8208;C bond formation in thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reactions. The developed approach not only allows to prioritize the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene cascade, dominating over alternative reactions, but also extends the scope of coupling products obtained from alkenes and alkynes of various structures and electron density distributions, regardless of their relative polarity difference, opening doors to more versatile synthetic possibilities. In the present study, we provide a powerful tool for atom&#8208;economical C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bond formation, paving the way for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Carrying out our experimental and computational studies, we elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying radical cascades, a knowledge that can be broadly applied in the field of organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein assemblies with tunable microstructures, including single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and doughnut&#8208;shaped hierarchical&#8208;structured protein aggregates.

Abstract
The construction of variable structured multi&#8208;protein nano&#8208;assemblies is of great interest for the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutic systems. This study showcases the synthesis of polymer&#8208;protein assemblies with tunable structure like single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and other hierarchical&#8208;structured assemblies by utilizing a dynamic template&#8208;assistant intermittent&#8208;assembly approach. The generalization of the methodology helps the protein assemblies to gain notable functional complexity. And we demonstrate compelling evidence highlighting the substantial impact of the topological morphology of protein nanoaggregates on their cellular uptake capacity.

         <title>Dual Nature of Thiophene Harnessed in the Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters via Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Murai and Yamaguchi report on near&#8208;infrared emitters derived from the dithieno[2,3&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;f]azepine core. Low band gaps were achieved by fusing antiaromatic azepine with thiophene rings equipped with electron&#8208;accepting moieties, which relieves the antiaromaticity of azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure. This novel approach provides dyes with fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters are of great interest for applications in bioimaging and modern technology. Yet the design of such materials with decent characteristics is challenging due to intrinsic limitations. In a recent article, Murai and Yamaguchi report the synthesis of NIR emitters with appreciable fluorescence quantum yields reaching 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm in CH2Cl2 solution. The low band gaps were achieved by a new design strategy exploiting antiaromaticity relief. This concept was realized for compounds consisting of an antiaromatic azepine central ring fused to thiophene moieties. In these systems, thiophene unfolds its dual nature. On the one hand, it contributes to the high antiaromaticity of azepine; on the other hand, it exerts a stabilizing effect on azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure, which reduces its antiaromaticity and shifts the absorption and emission maxima into the NIR region.

In a recent article, Murai and Yamaguchi report the synthesis of NIR emitters with appreciable fluorescence quantum yields reaching 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution. The low band gaps were achieved by a new design strategy exploiting antiaromaticity relief. This concept was realized for compounds consisting of an antiaromatic azepine central ring fused to thiophene moieties. In these systems, thiophene unfolds its dual nature. On the one hand, it contributes to the high antiaromaticity of azepine; on the other hand, it exerts a stabilizing effect on azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure, which reduces its antiaromaticity and shifts the absorption and emission maxima into the NIR region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stable Extra&#8208;Large Pore and High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Derived from Ge&#8208;Rich Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multidimensional extra&#8208;large pore zeolite with highly hydrothermal stability, denoted as &#8208;IRT&#8208;HS, has been developed successfully, starting from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor hydrothermally directed by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). &#8208;IRT&#8208;HS, with the supermicropores, is structurally analogues to 28&#8208;membered ring &#8208;IRT topology as confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. And it is the high&#8208;silica (Si/Ge=58) zeolite with the largest pore size as well. Notably, using acid&#8208;washed as&#8208;made Ge&#8208;rich &#8208;IRT precursor as the silicon source is crucial to restore partially collapsed structure into a stable framework by OSDA&#8208;assisted recrystallization. The calcined &#8208;IRT&#8208;HS maintains a high crystallinity, even when stored in a humid environment for extended periods or directly exposed to water. Additionally, high silica Al&#8208;containing analogue is also readily synthesized, serving as an active solid&#8208;acid catalyst in 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction, yielding an impressive initial conversion up to 76.1% much higher than conventional large&#8208;pore Beta zeolite (30.4%). This work will pave the way for the designed synthesis of targeted high&#8208;silica zeolites with stable and extra&#8208;large pore frameworks, mimicking the structures of existing Ge&#8208;rich counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Cover Picture: Entropy&#8208;Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian white material, introducing an innovative concept for developing robust cathodes for use in Na&#8208;ion batteries. In their Research Article (e202315371), Torsten Brezesinski, Ben Breitung, Yanjiao Ma and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that enhanced performance is linked to increased configurational entropy, and a proposed mechanism underscores the synergistic effects of suppressing phase transitions and mitigating gas evolution.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8208;Bismuth Bicycles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles can effectively penetrate human cell membranes. They are easy to synthesize, require only three positive charges for cell entry, and their uptake can be monitored by mass spectrometry due to the unique ability to trace bismuth. This discovery offers an alternative to fluorophore labeling and opens new possibilities for designing therapeutic agents with improved cellular uptake and traceability.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles, which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter human cells as demonstrated by live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs like the TAT peptide (derived from the transactivating transcriptional activator of human immunodeficiency virus 1) or octaarginine (R8), despite requiring only three positive charges. Bicyclization triggered by the presence of bismuth(III) increases cellular uptake by more than one order of magnitude. Through the analysis of cell lysates using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), we have introduced an alternative approach to examine the cellular uptake of CPPs. This has allowed us to confirm the presence of bismuth in cells after exposure to our CPPs. Mechanistic studies indicated an energy&#8208;dependent endocytic cellular uptake sensitive to inhibition by rottlerin, most likely involving macropinocytosis.

         <title>Stabilization of NH&#8722; Group Adjacent to Naked Silicon(II) Atom in Base Stabilized Aminosilylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the isolation of the first examples of free aminosilylenes 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b having &#8722;NH group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Aminosilylenes showed unique reactivity upon heating; an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation with 1&#8201;a afforded cyclic silazane, whereas 1&#8201;b showed a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to afford rare silanimine.







Abstract
Aminosilylene, comprising reactive NH&#8722; and Si(II) sites next to each other, is an intriguing class of compounds due to its ability to show diverse reactivity. However, stabilizing the reactive NH&#8722; group next to the free Si(II) atom is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report the first examples of base stabilized free aminosilylenes Ar*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;a) and Mes*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;b) (Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl and Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl), tolerating a NH&#8722; group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Remarkably, 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibited interesting differences in their reactivity upon heating. With 1&#8201;a, an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of one of the benzhydryl methine hydrogen atoms to the Si(II) atom produced the five&#8208;membered cyclic silazane 2. However, with 1&#8201;b, a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to the Si(II) atom afforded a silanimine 3, with a hydride ligand attached to an unsaturated silicon atom. Further, the coordination capabilities of 1&#8201;a were also tested with Ru(II) and Fe(0) precursors. Treatments of 1&#8201;a with [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 led to the isolation of a &#951;6&#8208;arene tethered complex [RuCl2{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene}] (4), whereas with the Fe(CO)5 precursor a Fe(0) complex [Fe(CO)4{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si}] (5) was obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the structural, bonding, and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;5.

         <title>Rational Design of a Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Disbiradical</title>

The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradical that exhibits highly dynamic behavior in solution leading to isomerization is presented. Among the various conformers, those that have significantly shorter distances between radical sites and thus can interact weakly through space dominate.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradicals, in which the radical sites exist as individual spin doublets with weak spin&#8208;spin interaction have not been known so far. Starting from monoradicals of the type [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R], we have now succeeded in linking two such monoradical phosphorus centers by appropriate choice of a linker. To this end, biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) was treated with 1,6&#8208;dibromohexane, affording the brominated species {Br[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (3). Subsequent reduction with KC8 led to the formation of the disbiradical {&#8901;[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (4) featuring a large distance between the radical phosphorus sites in the solid state and formally the highest biradical character observed in a P&#8208;centered biradical so far, approaching 100&#8201;%. EPR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;line signal in solution with a considerably larger exchange interaction than would be expected from the molecular structure of the single crystal. Quantum chemical calculations revealed a highly dynamic conformational space; thus, the two radical sites can approach each other with a much smaller distance in solution. Further reduction of 4 resulted in the formation of a potassium salt featuring the first structurally characterized P&#8208;centered distonic radical anion (5&#8722;). Moreover, 4 could be used in small molecule activation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isoxeniolide A
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the xenicane&#8208;type marine natural product isoxeniolide A has been accomplished through a ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis sequence and an intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction to forge the nine&#8208;membered ring as the key enabling steps. The NHK cyclization was highly diastereoselective and provided the oxabicyclo[7.4.0]tridecene core of isoxeniolide A as a single stereoisomer.







Abstract
Isoxeniolide A is a highly strained xenicane diterpenoid of marine origin. This natural product is representative for a subfamily of xenicanes incorporating an allylic hydroxy group in the nine&#8208;membered ring; members of this xenicane subfamily so far have not been targeted by total synthesis. Herein, we describe the first asymmetric total synthesis of isoxeniolide A. Key to forming the challenging E&#8208;configured cyclononene ring was a diastereoselective intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction. Other important transformations include an enzymatic desymmetrization for absolute stereocontrol, a diastereoselective cuprate addition and the use of a bifunctional vinyl silane building block. Our strategy also permits access to the enantiomer of the natural product and holds potential to access a multitude of xenicane natural products and analogs for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies.

The built&#8208;in electric field&#160;of polymer semiconductors determines its interfacial space charge and band bending to separate electrons and holes. In their Research Article (e202318224), Yi&#8208;Jing Chen, Zhi&#8208;Xing Wu, Jing&#8208;Xin Jian et&#8197;al. report three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers with different molecular orientations of ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylenediamine linkers. By regulating the dipole moment of PDI derivatives, a robust BIEF was created to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieve efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

         <title>Identification of Cu(111) as Superior Active Sites for Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3 with High Single&#8208;Pass Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visual demonstration of the s&#8208;p and d&#8208;p hybridization states between Cu and N atom in N&#8722;O during the adsorption and activation mechanism of NO molecules is brought. The &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* coordination bond&#8221; formed between N atom and Cu center is the essence of the interaction between the Cu center and NO molecule. The Cu3d electrons occupy the &#960;* orbitals in NO, eventually weakening the N&#8801;O triple bond.







Abstract
Opting for NO as an N source in electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis presents an intriguing approach to tackle energy and environmental challenges. However, blindly pursuing high NH3 synthesis rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE) while ignoring the NO conversion ratio could result in environmental problems. Herein, Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) surface is fabricated and exhibit a NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 yield rate of 371.89&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (flow cell) and the highest FE of 93.19&#177;1.99&#8201;% (H&#8208;type cell). The NO conversion ratio is increased to the current highest value of 63.74&#8201;% combined with the development of the flow cell. Additionally, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) clearly reveals that the &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; is the essence of the interaction between the Cu and NO as also supported by operando attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IRAS) in observing the key intermediate of NO&#8722;. This work not only achieves a milestone NO conversion ratio for electrocatalytic NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3, but also proposes a new descriptor that utilizes orbital hybridization between molecules and metal centers to accurately identify the real active sites of catalysts.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;like Niobovanadate Cage Built from {(Nb)V5} Pentagon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic polyoxovanadate cage, V30Nb12, has been successfully synthesized by introducing Nb to polyoxovanadates and the V30Nb12 cage is assembled by 12 {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, similar to fullerene C60.







Abstract
The striking aesthetic appeal of fullerene&#8208;like clusters has captured the interest of researchers. Nevertheless, the assembly of fullerene&#8208;like polyoxovadanadate (POV) cages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable pentagonal motif. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic POV cage, {(V2O)V30Nb12O102(H2O)12} (V30Nb12), by introducing Nb into the POVs. V30Nb12 is assembled by 12 heterometallic {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, reminiscent of C60. To our knowledge, the fullerene&#8208;like V30Nb12 not only represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity POV cage but also stands as the first niobovanadate cluster. Notably, V30Nb12 exhibits excellent solution stability, as confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS, FT&#8208;IR and UV/Vis spectra. As there is no protection organic ligand on its outer surface, V30Nb12 can be further modified with Cu&#8208;complexes to form a fullerene&#8208;like cluster based zigzag chain (Cu&#8722;V30Nb12).

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidated that the kinetical pathway can be maintained by regulating the structural connectivity of the in situ induced electrochemical Li reservoir, which ensures efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway. The well&#8208;distributed electrochemical Li reservoirs can serve as nucleation sites to promote uniform Li deposition and then improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries effectively.







Abstract
Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an innovative operando plasmon&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry technique for the sensitive detection of interfacial species during electrochemical reactions. This platform is established by plasmonic antennae electrically connected via monolayer graphene and exhibits a remarkable signal enhancement. The enhanced IR features enable the reconstruction of electrochemical curves and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
IR spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;IR) is a cutting&#8208;edge operando method for exploring electrochemical reaction mechanisms. However, detection of interfacial molecules is challenged by the limited sensitivity of existing EC&#8208;IR platforms due to the lack of high&#8208;enhancement substrates. Here, we propose an innovative plasmon&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;PEIRS) platform to overcome this sensitivity limitation. Plasmonic antennae with ultrahigh IR signal enhancement are electrically connected via monolayer graphene while preserving optical path integrity, serving as both the electrode and IR substrate. The [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; redox reaction and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are investigated on the EC&#8208;PEIRS platform with a remarkable signal enhancement. Notably, the enhanced IR signals enable a reconstruction of the electrochemical curve of the redox reactions and unveil the CO2RR mechanism. This study presents a promising technique for boosting the in&#8208;depth understanding of interfacial events across diverse applications.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported a novel molecular strategy to optimize commercial hard carbon (HC). A disodium phthalate (DP) molecule with two Na+ is capable of efficiently replenishing the Na+ loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) generation. The as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (&#8776;7.4&#8197;nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8&#8201;%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.3&#8201;% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.

         <title>The Influence of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces on Organic Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability Revealed through Theoretical Calculations and Morphology Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The donor/acceptor interface structures and features show an obvious influence on blending phase&#8208;separation morphology and charge transport behavior. It is not reasonable to simply judge the quality of fluorinated and chlorinated acceptors without suitable selection of donors, and regulating donor/acceptor interfaces can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel acceptors.







Abstract
End&#8208;groups halogenation strategies, generally refers to fluorination and chlorination, have been confirmed as simple and efficient methods to regulate the photoelectric performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), but a controversy over which one is better has existed for a long time. Here, two novel NFAs, C9N3&#8208;4F and C9N3&#8208;4Cl, featured with different end&#8208;groups were successfully synthesized and blended with two renowned donors, D18 and PM6, featured with different electron&#8208;withdrawing units. Detailed theoretical calculations and morphology characterizations of the interface structures indicate NFAs based on different end&#8208;groups possess different binding energy and miscibility with donors, which shows an obvious influence on phase&#8208;separation morphology, charge transport behavior and device performance. After verified by other three pairs of reported NFAs, a universal conclusion obtained as the devices based on D18 with fluorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs and PM6 with chlorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs generally show excellent efficiencies, high fill factors and stability. Finally, the devices based on D18: C9N3&#8208;4F and PM6: C9N3&#8208;4Cl yield outstanding efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% and 18.00&#8201;%, respectively. Suitably selecting donor and regulating donor/acceptor interface can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel NFAs, which points out the way for further molecular design and selection for high&#8208;performance and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>Immobilized Tetraalkylammonium Cations Enable Metal&#8208;free CO2 Electroreduction in Acid and Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively charged polyelectrolyte formed by the electrostatic interaction between poly(diallydimethylammonium)and graphene oxide is devised on the surface of Ag catalysts. This porous medium with immobilized cations augments CO2 electroreduction to CO in acid&#8208; and pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration.

&lt;p&gt;A positively charged polyelectrolyte formed by the electrostatic interaction between poly(diallydimethylammonium)and graphene oxide is devised on the surface of Ag catalysts. This porous medium with immobilized cations augments CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to CO in acid- and pure-water-fed zero-gap electrolyzers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss and regeneration. Performing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present-day acid-fed membrane electrode assemblies.

         <title>A Sulfur&#8208;Doped Copper Catalyst with Efficient Electrocatalytic Formate Generation during the Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A S&#8208;doped&#8208;Cu catalyst excluding post&#8208;transition metal was shown to exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This owes to the plenary grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds in CuS after electrolysis, while the latter factor can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates to further improve the activity.







Abstract
Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals has struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ex situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8722;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic element (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.

         <title>A Double&#8208;ligand Chelating Strategy to Iron Complex Anolytes with Ultrahigh Cyclability for Aqueous Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy was proposed to design Fe(TEA)MM complex as anolyte materials with high binding energy, robust coordination structure, highly electrochemical activity and good reversibility. All iron flow batteries based on Fe(TEA)MM anolytes and Fe(CN)6 catholytes reach a low capital cost of $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 and record&#8208;breaking cycling stability without detectable energy efficiency and capacity decay during 1400 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large&#8208;scale and long&#8208;term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge&#8208;discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe3+ and Fe2+, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100&#8201;% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 (e.g., 20&#8197;h duration), cheaper than Li&#8208;ion battery and vanadium flow battery. This double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy not only solves the current problems faced by AIFBs, but also provides an insight for further improving the cycling stability of other flow batteries.

         <title>Perovskite Single Crystals with Self&#8208;Cleaning Surface for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface contamination issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals is addressed by the self&#8208;cleaning effect induced by an amphiphilic molecule, which leads to improved crystal properties and a record efficiency of 23.4&#8201;% for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells. Moreover, this strategy applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphologies and compositions, which can contribute to improve other optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite single crystals are promising for diverse optoelectronic applications. As a universal issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals, surface contamination causes adverse effect on material properties and device performance. Herein, learning from the self&#8208;cleaning effect of lotus leaf, we address the surface contamination issue by introducing an amphiphilic long&#8208;chain organic amine into the perovskite crystal growth solution. Self&#8208;assembly of CTAC provides a hydrophobic crystal surface, inducing spontaneous removal of residual growth solution, which results in clean surface and better optoelectronic properties of perovskite single crystals. An impressive efficiency of 23.4&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new record for FAxMA1&#8208;xPbI3 single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Moreover, our strategy also applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphology and composition, which may contribute to improvement of other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering Tunable Ratiometric Dual Emission in Single Emitter&#8208;based Amorphous Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular structural strategy enabling single emitter based dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms is presented. The developed amorphous films endow in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics to show highly controllable multiple luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission), which benefits to the construction of an irreplaceable set of optical information combination.







Abstract
Molecular emitters with multi&#8208;emissive properties are in high demand in numerous fields, while these properties basically depend on specific molecular conformation and packing. For amorphous systems, special molecular arrangement is unnecessary, but it remains challenging to achieve such luminescent behaviors. Herein, we present a general strategy that takes advantage of molecular rigidity and S1&#8208;T1 energy gap balance for emitter design, which enables fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms, whether crystalline or amorphous. Subsequently, the amorphism of the emitters based polymethyl methacrylate films endowed an in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics. With the ratiometric regulation of phosphorescence by external stimuli and stable fluorescence as internal reference, highly controllable luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission) was achieved. There properties together with a persistent luminous behavior is of benefit for an irreplaceable set of optical information combination, featuring an ultrahigh&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting ability. Our research introduces a concept of eliminating the crystal&#8208;form and molecular&#8208;conformational dependence of complex luminescent properties through emitter molecular design. This has profound implications for the development of functional materials.

         <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Harvesting Materials Based on Organic Photovoltaic D/A Heterojunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a highly promising method to meet the surging energy consumption globally through the environmentally friendly means. As the initial step before photocatalysis, harvesting photons from sunlight is crucially important, thus making the design of photosensitizers with visible even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions get more and more attentions. In the past three years, organic donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunctions with absorptions extending to 950 nm, have emerged as the new star light&#8208;harvesting materials for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exciting advantages over inorganic materials in solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. This Minireview firstly gives a brief discussion about the principle processes and determining factors for photocatalytic water splitting with organic photovoltaic D/A heterojunction as photosensitizers. Thereafter, the current progress is summarized in details by introducing typical and excellent D/A heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Finally, not only the great prospects but also the most challenging issues confronted by organic D/A heterojunctions are indicated along with a perspective on the opportunities and new directions for future material explorations.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanopiperazines as Specific Covalent Inhibitors of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme UCHL1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross&#8208;reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ&#8208;1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl,N&#8208;cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with potent target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5&#8208;membered pyrrolidines to 6&#8208;membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context&#8208;dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound&#8208;induced conformational restriction of the cross&#8208;over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8208;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Iron with Eight Coordination in Iron Trifluoride under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of hypercoordination has been a subject of fundamental interest, especially for understanding structures that challenge conventional wisdom. The small ionic radii of Fe ions typically result in coordination numbers of 4 or 6 in stable Fe&#8208;bearing ionic compounds. While 8&#8208;coordinated Fe has been observed in highly compressed oxides, the pursuit of hypercoordinated Fe still faces significant challenges due to the complexity of synthesizing the anticipated compound with another suitable anion. Through first&#8208;principles simulation and advanced crystal structure prediction methods, we predict that an orthorhombic phase of FeF3 with exclusively 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is energetically stable above 18 GPa&#8212;a pressure more feasibly achieved compared to oxides. Inspired by this theoretical result, &#160;we conducted extensive experiments using&#160;a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell technique to investigate the crystal structures of FeF3 at high&#8208;pressure conditions. We successfully synthesized the predicted orthorhombic phase of FeF3 at 46 GPa, as confirmed by in&#8208;situ experimental X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This work establishes a new ionic compound featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe in a simple binary Fe&#8208;bearing system and paves the way for discovering Fe hypercoordination in similar systems.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Module Editing Of NRPS Enables Production Of Highly Potent Gq&#8208;Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Derived From Unculturable Plant Symbiont</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterotrimeric G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) that are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes and thus major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. The cyclic depsipeptides YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin. We therefore embarked on constructing an artificial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for FR900359 with YM&#8208;254890 BGC as a template using &#8220;in vitro module editing&#8221; technology, first developed for the modification of type&#8208;I PKS BGCs, to edit YM&#8208;254890 BGC. The resulting artificial BGCs coding FR900359 were heterologously expressed in the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 host strain.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous All&#8208;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising energy storage devices because of their high safety and low cost. However, their energy densities are generally unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of ion&#8208;inserted electrode materials, prohibiting their widespread applications. Herein, a high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge&#8208;carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two&#8208;electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447 mAh g&#8208;1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work will widen the scope for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

Herein, a high-energy aqueous all-sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge-carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two-electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all-sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447 mAh g-1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1 A g-1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393 Wh kg-1. This work will widen the scope for the design of high-energy aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co&#8208;assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge&#8208;transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.







Abstract
The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z&#8208;Scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential. The strategy provided a new perspective for the design of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning Active Site Flexibility by Defect Engineering of Graphene Ribbon Edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8722;N3 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the critical role of vertical displacement of Fe atom, which can be modulated by defect engineering, in tuning the electron structure and stabilizing the transition state of rate&#8208;determining step, and demonstrates that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity is determined by the flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site, which is further affected by the Fe&#8722;N bond length. Importantly, this simple geometric parameter is tunable and readily probed experimentally.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported transition metal catalysts are excellent for several reactions. Structural engineering of M&#8722;Nx sites to boost catalytic activity is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8722;N3 sites with varying Fe&#8722;N bond lengths distinguishable by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density&#8208;functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N3 distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high&#8208;performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.

To flow or not to flow ? Assessing feasibility and guiding chemists with a priori computational intelligence for reaction optimization under continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, to provide mechanistic insight, to contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.

The synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides is described, showing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Biological studies revealed the neuroprotective activity of the S product for dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin.







Abstract
Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of centrally chiral azomethine imines relies on kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. Herein, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.

         <title>Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt&#8208;based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect&#8208;Mediated Dopant Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced activity and stability of surface&#8208;doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale description for group VI transition metal oxide&#8208;doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.







Abstract
Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions.

     alt="Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt-based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect-Mediated Dopant Adsorption"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhanced activity and stability of surface-doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic-scale description for group VI transition metal oxide-doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. However, these alloys are susceptible to metal loss through leaching and degradation, leading to reduced catalyst stability and activity.

Here, to achieve atomic scale understanding of the exceptional activity and stability of these alloys, we present a detailed density functional theory description of the dopants&#8217; structures and impact on electrocatalyst properties.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated &#8220;functionalization&#8208;defunctionalization&#8221; approach efficiently produces bio&#8208;based surfactants directly from the hemicellulose and lignin fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The performance of the resulting sugar and lignin&#8208;based surfactants are competitive with existing commercial products, highlighting the potential for using these biomass fractions as surfactants with minimal structural modification.







Abstract
Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29&#8201;% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80&#8201;% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.

         <title>Surface Activation by Single Ru Atoms for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>

Stable single Ru atoms on the surface of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948; (SDC) could evidently modify the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V and 800&#8201;&#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high&#8208;temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Terminal Alkynes Involving in Situ&#8208;Generated &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal aryl alkynes with sulfilimines was achieved. It proceeds via an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization or Pictet&#8211;Spengler reactions to selectively form fused indoles. The formation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles and imidazoles derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization is also presented.







Abstract
An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct 2&#8208;substituted indoles and aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation of &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by the activation of a second alkyne leading to 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, which is significantly different from previous dual activation or 1,6&#8208;carbene shift approaches for diyne systems. In the case of ortho&#8208;alkynylaniline as starting material, an unexpected regioselective formation of the indole moiety via the intermolecular path, instead of intramolecular hydroamination was discovered. This reactivity paved the way for a one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 11H&#8208;indolo [3,2&#8208;c] quinoline scaffold by exploiting the formed amino indole for a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes. The photophysical properties of the carbazoles indicated good violet&#8208;blue emission with quantum yields up to 40&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>

         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, facilitating the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Intermediates adsorbed on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species in the CH4 production from CO2 form are more thermodynamically favorable. The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH4 selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH4 production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), over ten times of that for CN.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.

The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), over ten times of that for CN.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi-electron steps. Achieving high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual-atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic-level donor-acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi-functional dual-atom based photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of the Trp 6&#8208;halogenase Thal allows post&#8208;translational bromination of a tetrapeptide tag with C&#8208;terminal tryptophan in proteins on a preparative scale using the brominating E. coli coexpression strain Brocoli. The bromoarene can be derivatized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling at 37&#8201;&#176;C. This opens new avenues for bio&#8208;orthogonal modification of proteins by biocatalytic bromination of minimally tagged proteins.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for the modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. By a semirational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays, leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression system Brocoli. Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved with Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bio&#8208;orthogonal functionalization and conjugation.

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction pathway that a soluble semiquinone serves as bifunction catalyst for reducing S and oxidizing Li2S is firstly demonstrated to substantially improve the reaction kinetic of S&#8596;Li2S interconversion, and the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries exhibit the remarkable performance.







Abstract
The reaction rate bottleneck during interconversion between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricted lifespan of Li&#8722;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;), as both e&#8208;/Li+ donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S and Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; in the initial discharging/charging state maximizes the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long&#8208;range electron transfer. With in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, the S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 1&#8197;C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>One Collision&#8212;Two Substituents: Gas&#8208;Phase Preparation of Xylenes under Single&#8208;Collision Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl radical with C5H8 isomers (2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, 1,3&#8208;pentadiene). Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.







Abstract
The fundamental reaction pathways to the simplest dialkylsubstituted aromatics&#8212;xylenes (C6H4(CH3)2)&#8212;in high&#8208;temperature combustion flames and in low&#8208;temperature extraterrestrial environments are still unknown, but critical to understand the chemistry and molecular mass growth processes in these extreme environments. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure and statistical calculations, this study uncovers a previously elusive, facile gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl (methylethynyl, CH3CC) with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (isoprene, C5H8). The reaction dynamics are driven by a barrierless addition of the radical to the diene moiety of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene followed by extensive isomerization (hydrogen shifts, cyclization) prior to unimolecular decomposition accompanied by aromatization via atomic hydrogen loss. This overall exoergic reaction affords a preparation of xylenes not only in high&#8208;temperature environments such as in combustion flames and around circumstellar envelopes of carbon&#8208;rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, but also in low&#8208;temperature cold molecular clouds (10&#8197;K) and in hydrocarbon&#8208;rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Triton and Titan. Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.

         <title>Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core&#8208;Shell Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H2 dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (Had) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdHx (PdHab) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&#8722; to form water.







Abstract

     alt="Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core-Shell Electrocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdH&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (PdH&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form water.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly accurate multi&#8208;reference calculations reveal the photophysical processes of a PNNP&#8208;type iridium catalyst, namely [Ir(III)H]+, and its subsequent reduction reactions to either HCOOH or CO. The present results depict the efficient reaction scenario, explain the origin of the HCOOH selectivity, and contribute to design new photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer (SET) and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate, Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, with the consistent&#8208;orientation&#8208;alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra exhibits an exceptionally large dipole moment, yielding a wide deep&#8208;UV transparent window, an enhanced SHG response of ca. 2.3&#8197;times that of KDP, and a suited birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180&#8197;nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.

A small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type semiconductor&#8208;based organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS) enables superior synapse characteristics in a single device with an unprecedented combination of facile fabrication, excellent ambient stability, and robust and flexible tunability. The OENS was used as a biosensor to detect dopamine at sub&#8208;micromolar level in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The ion/chemical&#8208;based modulation feature of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are critical to advancing next generation bio&#8208;integrated neuromorphic hardware. Despite achievements with polymeric OMIECs in organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS). However, small molecule OMIECs based OENS has not yet been realized. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate an effective materials design concept of combining n&#8208;type fused all&#8208;acceptor small molecule OMIECs with subtle side chain optimization that enables robustly and flexibly modulating versatile synaptic behavior and sensing neurotransmitter in solid or aqueous electrolyte, operating in accumulation modes. By judicious tuning the ending side chains, the linear oligoether and butyl chain derivative gNR&#8208;Bu exhibits higher recognition accuracy for a model artificial neural network (ANN) simulation, higher steady conductance states and more outstanding ambient stability, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art n&#8208;type OMIECs based OENS. These superior artificial synapse characteristics of gNR&#8208;Bu can be attributed to its higher crystallinity with stronger ion bonding capacities. More impressively, we unprecedentedly realized n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OMIECs based OENS as a neuromorphic biosensor enabling to respond synaptic communication signals of dopamine even at sub&#8208;&#956;M level in aqueous electrolyte. This work may open a new path of small&#8208;molecule ion&#8208;electron conductors for next&#8208;generation ANN and bioelectronics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete azooligomers and their corresponding assemblies were synthesized by an iterative exponential growth strategy involving dynamic helicity inversion and chirality transfer. The interconversion of H&#8208;aggregates and J&#8208;aggregates in discrete azooligomer assemblies results in different helicity reversals and morphological transitions.







Abstract
Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial for exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, and it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.

         <title>Interphase Regulation by Multifunctional Additive Empowering High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life and Thermal Safety</title>

A novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP) is designed to effectively suppress the HF generation and facilitate the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer, empowering NCM811/S650 full cells with enhanced cycle life and thermal safety.







Abstract
High energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) adopting high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes and silicon&#8208;based composite anodes always suffer from unsatisfied cycle life and poor safety performance, especially at elevated temperatures. Electrode /electrolyte interphase regulation by functional additives is one of the most economic and efficacious strategies to overcome this shortcoming. Herein, cyano&#8208;groups (&#8722;CN) are introduced into lithium fluorinated phosphate to synthesize a novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP), which endows high nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/SiOx&#8208;graphite composite full cell with an ultrahigh cycle life and superior safety characteristics, by adding only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiTFTCP into a LiPF6&#8208;carbonate baseline electrolyte. It is revealed that LiTFTCP additive effectively suppresses the HF generation and facilitates the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer. The favorable SEI/CEI layers greatly lessen the electrode degradation, electrolyte consumption, thermal&#8208;induced gassing and total heat&#8208;releasing. This work illuminates the importance of additive molecular engineering and interphase regulation in simultaneously promoting the cycling and thermal safety of LIBs with high&#8208;nickel NCMxyz cathode and silicon&#8208;based composite anode.

         <title>Photocatalytic Production of Ethanolamines and Ethylenediamines from Bio&#8208;Polyols over a Cu/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 catalyst with multiple active sites was developed to produce ethanolamines and ethylenediamines from bio&#8208;polyols via a photocatalytic process in one pot. Oxidation by photogenerated holes over TiO2 was responsible for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage of polyols, and metallic copper was active for reductive amination via self&#8208;hydrogen transfer. It affords a novel strategy for biomass conversion to aminated compounds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethanolamines and ethylenediamines is highly attractive. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step photocatalytic protocol to convert bio&#8208;polyols into a 60&#8201;% yield of ethanolamines and ethylenediamines over a multifunctional Cu/TiO2 catalyst. This catalyst enables a tandem process of photocatalytic polyol C&#8722;C bond cleavage and reductive amination in one pot at room temperature, and also allows the selective conversion of various bio&#8208;polyols and amines. Mechanistic studies revealed that photogenerated holes in TiO2 promote the retro&#8208;aldol C&#8722;C bond cleavage or oxidative dehydrogenation of polyols, and photogenerated electrons accumulate on small&#8208;sized Cu clusters, which facilitate the reductive amination via hydrogen transfer and prevent the H2 generation. This strategy provides new opportunities for the development of non&#8208;noble metal photocatalysts and methods of biomass conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>A Homopolymer of Xanthenoxanthene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Heteroaromatic for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting homopolymer, hailing from an electron&#8208;rich peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic monomer, produces uniform films with heightened hole mobility, amplified modulus, and constrained species diffusion. These attributes enable the construction of perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, which also exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational durability.







Abstract
Highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically rely on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole transporter, achieving a 25.7&#8201;% efficiency record. However, these cells are susceptible to harsh 85&#8201;&#176;C conditions. Here, we present a peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based semiconducting homopolymer (p&#8208;TNI2) with matched energy levels and a high molecular weight, synthesized nearly quantitatively through facile oxidative polymerization. Compared to established materials, p&#8208;TNI2 excels in hole mobility, morphology, modulus, and waterproofing. Implementing p&#8208;TNI2 as the hole transport layer results in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, rivaling 24.4&#8201;% for the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD control cells under identical conditions. Furthermore, the p&#8208;TNI2&#8208;based cells exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational robustness.

         <title>A Fully Amorphous, Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linked Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Operating at Subzero&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

We demonstrate a fully amorphous quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a dynamic cross&#8208;linked network composed of a star&#8208;shaped plasticising polymer and a linear poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The electrolyte achieves high Li+ conductivity (2.96&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high tLi+ (0.81), and the as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries exhibit high reversible capacity and long cycle life when operating at subzero temperature conditions.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li&#8208;ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li+&#8208;conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross&#8208;linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross&#8208;linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li+ conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high-energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li-ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross-linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi-solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &amp;gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross-linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor 2&#8208;Tagged Aptamer Chimeras (ITACs) Modular Assembly for Targeted and Efficient Degradation of Two Membrane Proteins</title>

Insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) enable robust targeted degradation of pathogenic membrane proteins and allow simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins.







Abstract
Overexpression of pathogenic membrane proteins drives abnormal proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Various strategies to durably knockdown membrane proteins with heterobifunctional degraders have been successfully developed, including LYTAC, KineTAC, and AbTAC. However, challenges including complicated synthetic procedures and the inability to simultaneously degrade multiple pathogenic proteins still exist. Herein, we developed insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) that link the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;targeting receptor IGF2R and membrane proteins of interest (POIs) based on specific recognition of aptamers to the POIs and high&#8208;affinity binding of IGF2 to IGF2R. We demonstrated that ITACs exhibit robust degradation efficiency of various membrane proteins in multiple cell lines. Furthermore, systematic studies revealed that a moderate cell&#8208;surface IGF2R level is responsible for the excellent degradation performance of ITACs. Importantly, we further established a modular assembly strategy that allows assembly of one IGF2 with two aptamers with precise stoichiometry (dITACs), enabling cooperative and simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins. This work provides an efficient and facile target membrane protein degradation platform and will shed light on the treatment of diseases related to the overexpression of membrane proteins.

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Co into specific Li sites within the Li2O framework adjusts band structures, weakens the Li&#8722;O interaction, and accelerates the decomposition kinetics of Li2O. It can serve as a cathode prelithiation agent to compensate for the irreversible lithium loss during the initial cycling, thus enhancing the energy density and cycle life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.







Abstract
Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8722;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7&#8197;mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (&#8776;980&#8197;mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270&#8197;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Iodonium Initiators: Paving the Air&#8208;free Oxidation of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties were designed to replace lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine in doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), which can oxidize Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance. The devices based on this oxidizing Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.







Abstract
To date, perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) with doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) hole transporting layers (HTLs) have shown the highest recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, their commercialization is still impeded by poor device stability owing to the hygroscopic lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and volatile 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine dopants as well as time&#8208;consuming oxidation in air. In this study, we explored a series of single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties to precisely manipulate the oxidation states of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance, and the oxidation mechanism was clearly understood. Iodine (III) in the diphenyliodonium cation (IP+) can accept a single electron from Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and forms Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ owing to its strong oxidability. Moreover, because of the coordination of the strongly delocalized TFSI&#8722; with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ in a stable radical complex, the resulting hole mobility was 30&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. In addition, the IP&#8208;TFSI initiator facilitated the growth of a homogeneous and pinhole&#8208;free Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD film. The pero&#8208;SCs based on this oxidizing HTL showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Coordinated W2S3 for Efficient Dual&#8208;pH Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 crystal has been reported based on the theoretical structure prediction in combination with experimental results. For application in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,PEM=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,AEM=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM, 360 h@AEM).







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that play a crucial role in renewable energy technologies.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Activation of a Microtubule Polymerization Inhibitor via Amide Functionalization of the Ruthenium Photocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamide functionalization of a green light&#8208;sensitive photoactivated chemotherapy agent based on ruthenium fine&#8208;tuned its excited states, dramatically improving red light absorption. The new prodrug inhibited microtubule polymerization under red light activation, efficiently killing cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, red light activation shrank non&#8208;melanoma skin tumors in mice, while in the dark the prodrug showed improved biosafety.







Abstract
Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that kills cancer cells via photochemical uncaging of a cytotoxic drug. Most ruthenium&#8208;based photocages used for PACT are activated with blue or green light, which penetrates sub&#8208;optimally into tumor tissues. Here, we report amide functionalization as a tool to fine&#8208;tune the toxicity and excited states of a terpyridine&#8208;based ruthenium photocage. Due to conjugation of the amide group with the terpyridine &#960; system in the excited state, the absorption of red light (630&#8197;nm) increased 8&#8208;fold, and the photosubstitution rate rose 5&#8208;fold. In vitro, red light activation triggered inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which led to apoptotic cell death both in normoxic (21&#8201;% O2) and hypoxic (1&#8201;% O2) cancer cells. In vivo, red light irradiation of tumor&#8208;bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction (45&#8201;%) with improved biosafety, thereby demonstrating the clinical potential of this compound.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Resonance Phosphine Oxide Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new phosphine oxide based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeleton is demonstrated with CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO featuring highly efficient ultraviolet (UV) multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, whose device achieved narrow&#8208;band emissions with peaks at &#8776;380&#8197;nm and full widths at half maximum of &#8776;30&#8197;nm, and especially record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies beyond 15&#8201;%.







Abstract
Efficient ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescent materials remain a great challenge, since short peak wavelength &lt;400&#8197;nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) &lt;50&#8197;nm are simultaneously required. In this sense, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring narrow&#8208;band emissions hold the promise for UV applications. Herein, a novel MR&#8208;TADF skeleton featuring carbazole&#8208;phosphine oxide (P=O) fused aromatics is developed to construct the first two UV MR emitters named CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO. In addition to synergistic resonance effects of P=O and N atom, sp3&#8208;hybrid P atom renders the curved polycyclic planes of CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO, giving rise to their narrowband UV emissions with peak wavelengths &lt;390&#8197;nm and FWHM&lt;35&#8197;nm. Besides configuration quasi&#8208;planarization for radiation enhancement and quenching suppression, P=O moiety further enhances singlet&#8208;triplet coupling to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence quantum yield of 62&#8201;% in tBCzP2PO doped films. As consequence, tBCzP2PO endowed its UV organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak at 382&#8197;nm and FWHM of 32&#8197;nm, and especially the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1&#8201;% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
129Xe NMR spectroscopy of a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline material fabricated using imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles revealed a spatiotemporally continuous void inside the column. The diameter of the channel&#8208;like nanospace was estimated to be 0.49&#8197;nm, and the diffusion coefficient of the Xe atoms inside the nanochannels was comparable to those of conventional microporous solid materials.







Abstract
Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.

         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;silica nanosheets undergo edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge oriented interlocking and self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like hollow shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The mechanically robust SA&#8208;SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal&#8208;catalysts for high&#8208;temperature methane reforming.







Abstract
Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well&#8208;defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D&#8208;nanomaterialsin self&#8208;assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties.

&lt;p&gt;2D-silica nanosheets undergo edge-to-edge oriented interlocking and self-assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron-sized soccer ball-like hollow shells (SA-SiMS). The mechanically robust SA-SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal-catalysts for high-temperature methane reforming.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well-defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge-to-edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D-nanomaterialsin self-assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties. This research unveils the discovery of controlled self-assembly of 2D-silica nanosheets (2D-SiNSs) into hollow micron-sized soccer ball-like shells (SA-SiMS).

         <title>Partially Ion&#8208;Paired Solvation Structure Design for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partially ion&#8208;paired solvation structure design is demonstrated that combines the beneficial characteristics of contact&#8208;ion pair (CIP) and solvent&#8208;separated ion pair (SSIP) structures. A facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anion/fluorinated co&#8208;solvent for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity, effectively expanding the operational capabilities of lithium batteries under extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated ester&#8208;based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature&#8208;resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion&#8208;paired solvation, leading to a half solvent&#8208;separated and half contact&#8208;ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co&#8208;solvents for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur&#8208;based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li&#8201;||&#8201;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (&gt;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) at &#8722;40, 23 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.

         <title>Enhanced Methanol Synthesis over Self&#8208;Limited ZnOx Overlayers on Cu Nanoparticles Formed via Gas&#8208;Phase Migration Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn species evaporated from ZnO particles can migrate and deposit onto Cu surface to form Zn oxide (ZnOx) encapsulation layers i.e., strong metal&#8208;support interaction state under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C in ZnO||Cu catalyst. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species and growth of ZnOx overlayer on Cu surface is self&#8208;limited, which constructs an optimal number of ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites to have enhanced methanol synthesis activity.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are widely used for chemical conversion, in which construction of high density metal&#8208;oxide or oxide&#8208;metal interface is an important means to improve their reaction performance. Here, Cu@ZnOx encapsulation structure has been in situ constructed through gas&#8208;phase migration of Zn species from ZnO particles onto surface of Cu nanoparticles under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species onto the Cu surface and growth of ZnOx overlayer is self&#8208;limited under the high temperature and redox gas (CO2/H2) conditions. Accordingly, high density ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites can be effectively tailored to have an enhanced activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. This work reveals a new route for the construction of active oxide&#8208;metal interface and classic strong metal&#8208;support interaction state through gas&#8208;phase migration of support species induced by high temperature redox reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for the Selective Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots Allow Optically Communicating Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) were employed as building blocks for crafting optical communicating assemblies. This approach relies on the selective functionalization of CNDs with clickable moieties and their subsequent controlled interconnection. This work provides new insights on the link between molecular and nanoscale events, paving the way to develop selective and addressable CNDs that can act as modular nanoscale synthons.







Abstract
The surface of Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) stands as a rich chemical platform, able to regulate the interactions between particles and external species. Performing selective functionalization of these nanoscale entities is of practical importance, however, it still represents a considerable challenge. In this work, we exploited the organic chemistry toolbox to install target functionalities on the CND surface, while monitoring the chemical changes on the material's outer shell through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Following this, we investigated the use of click chemistry to covalently connect CNDs of different nature en&#8208;route towards covalent suprastructures with unprecedent molecular control. The different photophysical properties of the connected particles allowed their optical communication in the excited state. This work paves the way for the development of selective and addressable CND building blocks which can act as modular nanoscale synthons that mirror the long&#8208;established reactivity of molecular organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer is reported, showing narrower band gap and higher electrical conductivity than its counterparts monopolymers and therefore excellent rate performance. Our findings provide a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have attracted a lot interest in batteries in recent years. However, most of them still suffer from low performance such as low electrode potential, slow reaction kinetics, and short cycle life. In this work, we report a strategy of fabricating donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers for facilitating the charge transfer and therefore accelerating the reaction kinetics by using the copolymer (p&#8208;TTPZ) of dihydrophenazine (PZ) and thianthrene (TT) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p&#8208;type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p&#8208;TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.

The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p-type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p-TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive and Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Recognition in Water by Sulfated Conjugated Corral[5]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new water&#8208;soluble corral&#8208;shaped conjugated host bearing ten sulfate groups at its two rims&#8212;namely, SC[5]A&#8212;was synthesized. SC[5]A not only exhibited ultrahigh binding affinities (up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards a series of rod&#8208;shaped substrates, but also effectively bound (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) a wide range of functional substrates. Additionally, the application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide was explored.







Abstract
The pursuit of synthetic receptors with high binding affinities has long been a central focus in supramolecular chemistry, driven by their significant practical relevance in various fields. Despite the numerous synthetic receptors that have been developed, most exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range or lower. Only a few exceptional receptors achieve binding affinities exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1, and their substrate scopes remain rather limited. In this context, we introduce SC[5]A, a conjugated corral&#8208;shaped macrocycle functionalized with ten sulfate groups. Owing to its deep one&#8208;dimensional confined hydrophobic cavity and multiple sulfate groups, SC[5]A displays an extraordinarily high binding strength of up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards several size&#8208;matched, rod&#8208;shaped organic dications in water. Besides, its conformation exhibits good adaptability, allowing it to encapsulate a wide range of other guests with diverse molecular sizes, shapes, and functionalities, exhibiting relatively strong affinities (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). Additionally, we've explored the preliminary application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of ultrahigh binding affinities (towards complementary guests) and adaptive recognition capability (towards a wide range of functional guests) of SC[5]A positions it as exceptionally valuable for numerous practical applications.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Pyrrole&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic RTP Material for Persistent Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) nano&#8208;probes with long emission wavelength faces challenges. In this work, organic RTP materials with near&#8208;infrared emission have been designed and cell membrane encapsulation has been used to optimize the nanomaterial process, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and imaging penetration depth.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials offer remarkable advantages in bioimaging due to their characteristic time scales and background noise elimination. However, developing near&#8208;infrared RTP materials for deep tissue imaging still faces challenges since the small band gap may increase the non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in weak emission and short phosphorescence lifetime. In this study, fused&#8208;ring pyrrole&#8208;based structures were employed as the guest molecules for the construction of long wavelength emissive RTP materials. Compared to the decrease of the singlet energy level, the triplet energy level showed a more effectively decrease with the increase of the conjugation of the substituent groups. Moreover, the sufficient conjugation of fused ring structures in the guest molecule suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons. Therefore, a near&#8208;infrared RTP material (764&#8197;nm) was achieved for deep penetration bioimaging. Tumor cell membrane is used to coat RTP nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid decreasing the RTP performance compared to traditional coating by amphiphilic surfactants. RTP NPs with tumor&#8208;targeting properties show favorable phosphorescent properties, superior stability, and excellent biocompatibility. These NPs are applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging to eliminate background interference with excellent tissue penetration. This study provides a practical solution to prepare long&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;lifetime organic RTP materials and their applications in bioimaging.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy has been developed for preparation of polydienes with high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and end&#8208;group functionalization efficiency. This approach utilizes a novel catalytic system in which allylic&#8208;Al moiety exhibits remarkable selectivity for alkylation and transalkylation and improves the end&#8208;group functionality efficiency for polydiene synthesis, showcasing its immense potential for development of advanced polymeric materials.







Abstract
There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99&#8201;%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than that of the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.

         <title>Chemical Engineering of Artificial Transcription Factors by Orthogonal Palladium(II)&#8208;Mediated S&#8208;Arylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site&#8208;selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity.

&lt;p&gt;An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site-selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well-defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine-based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)-mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side&#8208;chain carboxylates of Asp1 and Asp7 in laspartomycin coordinate with a calcium cation to adopt the active conformation. When these residues were replaced by serine, calcium dependence was eliminated and the resulting synthetic analogue depended instead on phenylboronic acid for its antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show modes of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analogue (B1) whose activity no longer depends on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor it in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in B1 and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrate that B1 inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC, i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate. B1 is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spatially&#8211;Temporally Synchronized Construction of Robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of constructing spatially&#8211;temporally synchronized (STS) robust solid&#8211;slectrolyte interphases (SEI) in aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries through synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction was proposed. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI protective layer enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemming from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion&#8208;reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially&#8208;Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It is worth highlighting that the Li3PO4 formation does not extra&#8208;consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&#8722;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100&#8201;% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. This energetic and robust SEI offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of dienyl sulfoxides were accomplished with up to 98&#8201;% ee from both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters employing cheap Ni(II) as precatalyst. Experimental and computational methods revealed an interesting associated outersphere mechanism which is uncommon in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic nucleophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98&#8201;% ee. The product exhibits tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aniline Derivatives via Palladium/ S,O&#8208;Ligand/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated anilines are directly synthesised via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand/norbornene cooperative catalysis without the need for additional synthetic steps. This method can be applied to a wide variety of aniline derivatives to provide a unique method for their direct meta&#8208;arylation. The isolation of several Pd complexes provides some useful insights into the factors influencing the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are ubiquitous moieties in organic molecules and their direct functionalization is of great interest in many research areas due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. While several synthetic tools exist for the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of anilines, the functionalization of the less reactive meta&#8208;position is not easy to achieve with current methods. To date, the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aniline derivatives has been restricted to either the use of directing groups &amp; templates, or their transformation into anilides &amp; quaternary anilinium salts. Herein, we report the first general and efficient meta&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;arylation of non&#8208;directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O&#8208;ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent&#8208;effects of both the aniline&#8208;substrate and the norbornene&#8208;mediator during the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.

Herein, we report the first general and efficient &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H-arylation of non-directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O-ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent-effects of both the aniline-substrate and the norbornene-mediator during the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H activation step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable numbers of B atoms in the linkages have first been achieved to construct the catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction. The COFs with high contents of the B atoms showed improved the activity and selectivity, due to more easily formation of the intermediate COOH*.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a series of tetrel sandwich complexes characterized by ten &#960;&#8208;electrons ([Li6]5+[E5]10&#8722;[Li6]5+). These complexes are both thermochemically and kinetically stable and exhibit &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
When (4n +2) &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single planar ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report a series of D5h&#8197;Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8722; ring (E=Si&#8722;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High&#8208;energy All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates are proposed as a groundbreaking platform for high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Benefiting from rational structure design, Li3PW12O4o electrolytes exhibit remarkable cost&#8208;effectiveness ($5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1), electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity (0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The lithium&#8208;metal batteries utilizing sustainable electrolyte achieve more than 200 cycles and the lithium&#8208;air batteries operate over 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.23&#8197;eV are obtained due to the optimized three&#8208;dimensional Li+ migration network of Li3PW12O40. Li3PW12O40 exhibits a wide window of electrochemical stability that can both accommodate the Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. As a result, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li3PW12O40/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35&#8197;V and an areal capacity of more than 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as a cost&#8208;competitive SSEs price of $5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, Li3PMo12O40 homologous to Li3PW12O40 was obtained via isomorphous substitution, which formed a low&#8208;resistance interface with Li3PW12O40. Applications of Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 in Li&#8208;air batteries further demonstrate that long cycle life (650 cycles) can be achieved. This strategy provides a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy to construct efficient and scalable solid polyoxometalate electrolytes for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time&#8208;series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small&#8208;scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40&#8208;fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.

     alt="Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time-series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small-scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40-fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for synthesizing chiral 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters bearing non&#8208;adjacent, acyclic 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, a novel activation mode for gem&#8208;diborylalkanes in asymmetric catalysis has been uncovered, avoiding two potential side&#8208;products encountered when using classical conditions. This innovative approach exhibits excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.

         <title>Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through a Global Desymmetrization Approach for Inverse C3H8/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker desymmetrization approach was used to fabricate infinite rod secondary building unit (SBU) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures carrying unique gfc net. The rod SBU can be simplified as 1&#8208;periodic cylindric sphere packing described in 1978 as 44 (3,3) and in the RCSR database as qbe, which has rarely been observed in MOF chemistry. The resulting MOF has nonpolar/inert pore surfaces and unusual inverse C3H8/C3H6 separation potential.







Abstract
The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod&#8208;shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;ASY) incorporating infinite Cu&#8208;carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography. Interestingly, the rod SBU can be simplified as a unique cylindric sphere packing qbe tubule made of [43.62] tiles, which further connect the tritopic linkers to give a newly discovered 3,5&#8208;connected gfc net. Cu&#8208;ASY is a permanent ultramicroporous material featuring 1D channels with highly inert surfaces and shows a preferential adsorption of propane (C3H8) over propene (C3H6). The efficiency of C3H8 selective Cu&#8208;ASY is validated by multicycle breakthrough experiments, giving C3H6 productivity of 2.2&#8197;L/kg. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that C3H8 molecules form multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and atypical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901; H&#8722;C van der Waals interactions with the inner nonpolar surfaces. This work therefore highlights the linker desymmetrization as an encouraging and intriguing strategy for achieving unique MOF structures and properties.

         <dc:description>
Axially chiral azomethine imines were efficiently constructed through Cu&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closures of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides. Biological studies revealed that the (S)&#8208;atropisomer product effectively protects dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting oxaliplatin&#8208;induced apoptosis, while the (R)&#8208;atropisomer lacks protective effects, as described by Bo Han, Gu Zhan, Bo Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312663).

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique stimuli in organelles could trigger in situ self&#8208;assembly of nanofibers with ordered structures, thus exhibiting differential influences on cells. In this minireview, we feature nanofibers in organelles, highlight their formation mechanism and triggering strategies, and discuss the biomedical applications and current challenges.







Abstract
Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous&#8208;forming units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.

Human&#8208;AI collaborative platform is described for synergistic design&#8208;synthesis&#8208;analysis workflow of SAHCs by integration of human&#8208;led atomistic insights with data&#8208;driven augmented toolbox towards accomplishing ultimate reality&#8208;enabled SAHCs manufacturing with atomic economy.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.

Locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) exhibit remarkable potential in revolutionizing the limitations of SACs. To date, no review has comprehensively summarized this intriguing topic. This minireview focuses on the compelling characteristics, synthetic strategies, characterization methods, and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts manifest nearly 100&#8201;% atom utilization efficiency, well&#8208;defined active sites, and high selectivity. However, their practical applications are hindered by a low atom loading density, uncontrollable location, and ambiguous interaction with the support, thereby posing challenges to maximizing their electrocatalytic performance. To address these limitations, the ability to arrange randomly dispersed single atoms into locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) substantially influences the electronic effect between reactive sites and the support, the synergistic interaction among neighboring single atoms, the bonding energy of intermediates with reactive sites and the complexity of the mechanism. As such, it dramatically promotes reaction kinetics, reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, improves the performance of the catalyst and simplifies the reaction mechanism. In this review, firstly, we introduce a variety of compelling characteristics of LO&#8208;SACs as electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies, characterization methods and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are elaborated to encourage further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Effects of Iron Species on Low Temperature CO2 Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;species will likely be present in large&#8208;scale systems, e.g. from steel components or contaminated electrolytes, so their role in low temperature CO2 electrolyzers must be understood. While they reportedly accelerate degradation of the polymer membrane and the CO2 reduction catalyst, they also enhance the oxygen evolution activity of catalysts. We use this duplicity to stress the need for holistic research of complex electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical energy conversion devices are considered key in reducing CO2 emissions and significant efforts are being applied to accelerate device development. Unlike other technologies, low temperature electrolyzers have the ability to directly convert CO2 into a range of value&#8208;added chemicals. To make them commercially viable, however, device efficiency and durability must be increased. Although their design is similar to more mature water electrolyzers and fuel cells, new cell concepts and components are needed. Due to the complexity of the system, singular component optimization is common. As a result, the component interplay is often overlooked. The influence of Fe&#8208;species clearly shows that the cell must be considered holistically during optimization, to avoid future issues due to component interference or cross&#8208;contamination. Fe&#8208;impurities are ubiquitous, and their influence on single components is well&#8208;researched. The activity of non&#8208;noble anodes has been increased through the deliberate addition of iron. At the same time, however, Fe&#8208;species accelerate cathode and membrane degradation. Here, we interpret literature on single components to gain an understanding of how Fe&#8208;species influence low temperature CO2 electrolyzers holistically. The role of Fe&#8208;species serves to highlight the need for considerations regarding component interplay in general.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Enzyme Cascades&#8212;Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>

Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron photocatalysis enables repurposing inexpensive trifluoroacetates as reagents for the C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Thanks to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere electron&#8208;transfer pathway, photodecarboxylation occurs under mild conditions and can be applied to complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.

         <title>Deconstructive Carboxylation of Activated Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;free photochemical method for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 is reported for the first time. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives and the synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs.







Abstract
Carboxylation with carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one notable methodology to produce carboxylic acids. In contrast to carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, carbon&#8211;carbon bond cleavage for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging due to their inherent and less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition metals. Here we report a photocatalytic protocol for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to generate carboxylic acids in the absence of transition metals. It is emphasized that our protocol provides carboxylic acids with obviously unchanged carbon numbers when terminal alkenes were used. To show the power of this strategy, a variety of pharmaceutically relevant applications including the modular synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives are demonstrated.

Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid&#8208;state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.







Abstract
The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#956;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase&#8197;II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand's benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid-state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;Diketones Catalyzed by Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 was accomplished under the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysis, delivering 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with &gt;99/1 dr values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities, while silane PhSiH3 facilitates an intramolecular hydrosilylation of the second carbonyl group.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of 1,2&#8208;diketones for the synthesis of optically active 1,2&#8208;diols, especially 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we describe the first highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 by using a chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst, giving a variety of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with excellent d.r. values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivites concurrently.

         <title>Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The beauty of one&#8208;pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine&#8208;promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane Catalyzed Amide Enolization for Enantioselective Cyclohexadienone Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding saturated fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst and represents the first unactivated carboxamide deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective transformation.







Abstract
The organocatalytic enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding 3D fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation represents the first strong activating group&#8208;free activation of carboxamides via &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective reaction, and is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylboration of Alkenes Enabled by Dual Photoredox and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a radical&#8208;based three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis. This protocol offers efficient access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency and reversed regioselectivity.







Abstract
A regioselectivity reversed three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis is reported. The mild conditions are compatible with a wide array of nonactivated trifluoromethyl aromatics bearing electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;neutral substituents, trifluoroacetamides, and various nonactivated terminal and internal alkenes, enabling straightforward access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol is applicable to alkene&#8208;tethered trifluoromethyl aromatics to furnish gem&#8208;difluoromethylene&#8208;containing cyclic compounds. Synthetic applications and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.

         <title>Mechanochemical Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer Reactions: Direct Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides from Sulfinamides and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, providing a wide range of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield.

A mechanochemical synthesis of sulfonimidamides by iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed exogenous ligand&#8208;free N&#8208;acyl nitrene transfer to sulfinamides is reported. The one&#8208;step method tolerates a wide range of sulfinamides with various substituents under solvent&#8208;free ambient conditions. Compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, this mechanochemical approach shows better conversion and chemoselectivity. Mechanistic investigations by ESI&#8208;MS revealed the generation of crucial nitrene iron intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N-acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one-step solvent-free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution-phase counterpart, providing a wide range of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, crucial nitrene iron complex intermediates are suggested by ESI-MS.

         <title>One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles: A Straightforward Access to 3&#8208;Fluorinated Quinolines and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources make one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of indoles and pyrroles facile, allowing for direct access to structurally diverse azines, especially the pharmaceutically important 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol features bench&#8208;stable reagents, a broad range of substrates, and good compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluorinated quinolines and pyridines are prevalent pharmacophores, yet their synthesis is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that dibromofluoromethane as bromofluorocarbene source enables the one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of readily available indoles and pyrroles to structurally diverse 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol requires only a short reaction time of ten minutes and can be performed under air atmosphere. Preliminary investigations reveal that this strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of other valuable azines by using different 1,1&#8208;dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources.

         <title>Speciation of Transition Metal Dissolution in Electrolyte from Common Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ion dissolution from the cathode, migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the anode is one of the leading causes of cell failure when cycling lithium&#8208;ion batteries to high potentials (&gt;4.2&#8197;V). To better understand what is occurring in the electrolyte, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy was performed to determine the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni that has dissolved into the electrolyte from commonly used cathodes.







Abstract
Significant capacity loss has been observed across extended cycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries cycled to high potential. One of the sources of capacity fade is transition metal dissolution from the cathode active material, ion migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the anode. While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), and (x Li2MnO3*(1&#8208;x) LiNiaMnbCocO2, with a+b+c=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDY) with clear structure and tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. Due to its rich microporous structure, the electron deficiency of the TAB group and the electron richness of the acetylene bond, TAB&#8208;GDY exhibits certain IAST selectivity in binary gas and is expected to be used for gas capture and separation.







Abstract
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.

         <title>Catalytic HF Shuttling between Fluoroalkanes and Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method to transfer formal equivalents of HF from fluoroalkanes to an alkyne is reported. The method leads to a simple approach generating geminal difluoroalkanes and it tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) was shown to act as an HF donor in place of the fluoroalkane.







Abstract
In this paper, we report BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 as a catalyst to shuttle equivalents of HF from a fluoroalkane to an alkyne. Reactions of terminal and internal aliphatic alkynes led to formation of difluoroalkane products, while diarylalkynes can be selectively converted into fluoroalkenes. The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible. The new catalytic system was applied to demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept recycling of poly(vinylidene difluoride).

         <title>&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Allylation of Trialkylamines with Allenes Promoted by Synergistic Borane/Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation reactions of trialkylamines with allenes were accomplished by a synergistic borane/palladium catalysis. The borane and palladium catalysts promoted the formation of an enamine intermediate from a trialkylamine and a palladium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate from an allene, respectively.







Abstract
Functionalization of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of trialkylamines is challenging, especially for reactions at positions other than the &#945; position. Herein, we report a method for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of trialkylamines. In these reactions, which involve synergistic borane/palladium catalysis, an enamine intermediate is first generated from the amine via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation promoted by B(C6F5)3 and a base, and then the enamine undergoes palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an allene to give the allylation product. Because the hydride and the proton resulting from the initial dehydrogenation are ultimately shuttled to the product by B(C6F5)3 and the palladium catalyst, respectively, these reactions show excellent atom economy. The establishment of this method paves the way for future studies of C&#8722;H functionalization of trialkylamines by means of synergistic borane/transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed as a host to confine charged iodine species. The robust physicochemical adsorption between cCNF and polyiodides effectively mitigated the shuttle effect and increased iodine loading, resulting in enhanced cycling stability and high energy density even at elevated temperatures, thereby demonstrating promising performance at the full&#8208;battery level.







Abstract
High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, high areal capacity of 2.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds drastically hinder the H2O2 production performance. This work presents a strategy that atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production.







Abstract
Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.

         <title>Tuning CH Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Receptors toward Picomolar Anion Affinity via the Inductive Effect of Distant Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

Ultrahigh binding affinity of bambusuril receptors toward halides is achieved and continuously increases with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing power of groups installed on its benzyl substituents, as measured by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, artificial hydrogen bond&#8208;based anion receptors have been developed to achieve high anion selectivity; however, their binding affinity is usually low. The potency of these receptors is usually increased by the introduction of aryl substituents, which withdraw electrons from their binding site through the resonance effect. Here, we show that the polarization of the C(sp3)&#8208;H binding site of bambusuril receptors, and thus their potency to bind anions, can be modulated by the inductive effect. The presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on benzyl substituents of bambusurils significantly increases their binding affinities to halides, resulting in the strongest iodide receptor reported to date with an association constant greater than 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. A Hammett plot showed that while the bambusuril affinity toward halides linearly increases with the electron&#8208;withdrawing power of their substituents, their binding selectivity remains essentially unchanged.

Reaction of Ba0 vapour with an anthracene ligand gave a Ba anthracene complex that crystallizes as a cyclic octamer and reacts as a Ba0 synthon.







Abstract
A hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble barium anthracene complex was prepared by means of metal vapour synthesis. Reaction of 9,10&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8242;&#8242;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;Et2O]8. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et2O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;arene. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY&#8197;NMR ) measurements in benzene&#8208;d6 indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8242;&#8242;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba2+/Anth&#8242;&#8242;2&#8722; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, Ph2C=NPh, or H2 show that the complex reacts as a Ba0 synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8242;&#8242;. This soluble molecular Ba0/BaII redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.

&#8220;We are excited by the possibilities of being able to use supramolecular systems to begin to engineer artificial cells that have complex collective behaviour&#226;&#166; Within the Langton group we are delighted to have hosted many very successful MChem project students, many of whom have played a valuable contribution to our ongoing research projects&#226;&#166;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Langton group.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Langton group in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford (UK). They recently published an article on a synthetic supramolecular signaling system, in which light is used to initiate the release of diffusible chemical signals from one population of vesicles to another. This triggers transmembrane cation transport in the receiver vesicles and amplifies the signal, in a manner reminiscent of signaling mechanisms in biology. &#8220;Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;responsive Zinc Ionophore&#8221;, S.&#8197;A.

         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) possessing dual carbene&#8208;carbocation behavior emulated as trifluoromethyl metal&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=M) has not been explored yet, and its reaction characteristics are unknown. Herein, a novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared and used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2 + 1 + 2] cycloadditions for the first time with commercially available N&#8208;fused heteroarenes and nitriles,&#160;yielding a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles that are of interest in medicinal chemistry, in which the insertion of trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh) into C=N bonds of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes was involved. This strategy demonstrates synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals, construction of CD3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles, gram&#8208;scale experiments, and synthesis of phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor analog. These highly valuable and modifiable imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles exhibit good antitumor activity in vitro, thus demonstrating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming a Radical Polarity Mismatch in Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]Bicyclobutanes: An Entryway to Sulfone&#8208; and Carbonyl&#8208;Containing SF5&#8211;Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first assortment of achiral pentafluorosulfanylated cyclobutanes (SF5&#8208;CBs) are now synthetically accessible through strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using SF5Cl. Methods for both chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of sulfone&#8208;based BCBs are detailed herein, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the logic extends to tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanylation, and three&#8208;component pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. The methods presented enable isolation of both syn and anti isomers of SF5&#8208;CBs, but we also demonstrate that this innate selectivity can be overridden in chloropentafluorosulfanylation; that is, an anti&#8208;stereoselective variant of SF5Cl addition across sulfone&#8208;based BCBs can be achieved by using inexpensive copper salt additives. Considering the SF5 group and CBs have been employed individually as nonclassical bioisosteres, structural aspects of these unique SF5&#8208;CB &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; were then contextualized using SC&#8208;XRD. From a mechanistic standpoint, chloropentafluorosulfanylation ostensibly proceeds through a curious polarity mismatch addition of electrophilic SF5 radicals to the electrophilic sites of the BCBs. Upon examining carbonyl&#8208;containing BCBs, we also observed rare instances whereby radical addition to the 1&#8208;position of a BCB occurs. The nature of the key C(sp3)&#8211;SF5 bond formation step &#8211; among other mechanistic features of the methods we disclose &#8211; was investigated experimentally and with DFT calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate compatibility of SF5&#8211;CBs with various downstream functionalizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid State Machinery of Multiple Dynamic Elements in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering coordinated rotational motion in porous architectures enables the fabrication of molecular machines in solids. A flexible two&#8208;fold interpenetrated pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework precisely organizes fast mobile elements such as bicyclopentane (BCP) (107Hz regime at 85 K), two distinct pyridyl rotors and E&#8208;azo group involved in pedal&#8208;like motion. Reciprocal sliding of the two sub&#8208;networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine&#8208;vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston&#8208;like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra&#8208;fast dynamics (107 Hz) at temperatures as low as 44 K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo&#8208;group in a crank&#8208;like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor&#8208;structure interplay.</dc:description>

Reciprocal sliding of the two sub-networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine-vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston-like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra-fast dynamics (107 Hz) at temperatures as low as 44 K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo-group in a crank-like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid-state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor-structure interplay.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se Bonds from Unstrained Ketone Precursors under Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild photocatalytic deacylative strategy employing unstrained methyl ketones as radical precursors has been developed to construct sulfides, disulfides, selenides, sulfoxides and sulfones. Combining this deacylative process with SN2 or coupling reactions provides novel and convenient modular approaches toward unsymmetrical or symmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
A mild photoredox catalyzed construction of sulfides, disulfides, selenides, sulfoxides and sulfones from unstrained ketone precursors is introduced. Combination of this deacylative process with SN2 or coupling reactions provides novel and convenient modular strategies toward unsymmetrical or symmetric disulfides. Reactivity studies favor a bromine radical that initiates a HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) from the aminal intermediate resulting in expulsion of a C&#8208;centered radical that is intercepted to make C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bonds. Gram scale reactions, broad substrate scope and tolerance towards various functional groups render this method appealing for future applications in the synthesis of organosulfur and selenium complexes.

         <title>&#8220;Whole&#8208;Body&#8221; Fluorination for Highly Efficient and Ultra&#8208;Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the serious chemical instability induced by the inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening their interior bonding architecture. The F&#8722; ions distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal impart exceedingly strong ionic interaction with the QDs, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defect.







Abstract
Inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), triggered by the weak Pb&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) bond, is recognized as the primary culprit for their serious instability. A promising way is to construct exceedingly strong ionic interaction inside the QDs and increase their crystal cohesive energy by substituting the interior X&#8722; with highly electronegative F&#8722;, however, which is challenging and hitherto remains unreported. Here, a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening the interior bonding architecture of QDs, wherein the F&#8722; are uniformly distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal encompassing both the interior lattice and surface, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defects. This approach effectively mitigates their intrinsic instability issues including light&#8208;induced phase segregation. As a result, light&#8208;emitting devices based on these QDs exhibit exceptional efficiency and remarkable stability.

         <title>Production of Biobased Ethylbenzene by Cascade Biocatalysis with an Engineered Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of commodity chemicals from renewable resources is vital for a sustainable society. A non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade is reported for the one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with up to 82&#8201;% conversion. The key enzyme, a photodecarboxylase, was semirationally engineered to boost productivity. The cascade was integrated with a fermentation process to yield ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol.







Abstract
Production of commodity chemicals, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), from renewable resources is key for a sustainable society. Biocatalysis enables one&#8208;pot multistep transformation of bioresources under mild conditions, yet it is often limited to biochemicals. Herein, we developed a non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade for one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene. The key rate&#8208;limiting photodecarboxylase was subjected to structure&#8208;guided semirational engineering, and a triple mutant CvFAP(Y466T/P460A/G462I) was obtained with a 6.3&#8208;fold higher productivity. With this improved photodecarboxylase, an optimized two&#8208;cell sequential process was developed to convert l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with 82&#8201;% conversion. The cascade reaction was integrated with fermentation to achieve the one&#8208;pot bioproduction of ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol, demonstrating the potential of cascade biocatalysis plus enzyme engineering for the production of biobased commodity chemicals.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 to Light Olefins over ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13(100) shows light olefins selectivity up to 89.4&#8201;% with CO2 conversion of 9.1&#8201;%. A higher Si/Al ratio can suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation of light olefins to alkanes and lead to hydrocarbons with lower carbon number. Intermediates species generated from ZnZrOx migrate to the SSZ&#8208;13, and can be converted to hydrocarbons immediately.







Abstract
Converting CO2 to olefins is an ideal route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins, especially single&#8208;component olefin, while reducing CH4 formation remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13 tandem catalyst for the highly selective hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins. This catalyst shows C2=&#8722;C4= and propylene selectivity up to 89.4&#8201;% and 52&#8201;%, respectively, while CH4 is suppressed down to 2&#8201;%, and there is no obvious deactivation. It is demonstrated that the isolated moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of SSZ&#8208;13 promotes the rapid conversion of intermediate species derived from ZnZrOx, thereby enhancing the kinetic coupling of the reactions and inhibit the formation of alkanes and improve the light olefins selectivity. Besides, the weaker BAS of SSZ&#8208;13 promote the conversion of intermediates into aromatics with 4&#8211;6 methyl groups, which is conducive to the aromatics cycle. Accordingly, more propene can be obtained by elevating the Si/Al ratio of SSZ&#8208;13. This provides an efficient strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins with high selectivity.

         <title>Organocatalyst Supported by a Single&#8208;Atom Support Accelerates both Electrodes used in the Chlor&#8208;Alkali Industry via Modification of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a bridge between single&#8208;atom catalysts and organocatalysts, organic molecules anchored on single&#8208;atom supports exhibit high efficiency, durability, and bifunctional properties on both electrodes used in the chlor&#8208;alkali industry. This work not only provides an alternative choice for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but also provides a new platform to study the catalyst consist inorganic and organic species together, which performs well in both reduction and oxidation process.







Abstract
Consuming one of the largest amount of electricity, the chlor&#8208;alkali industry supplies basic chemicals for society, which mainly consists of two reactions, hydrogen evolution (HER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Till now, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst applied in this field is still the dimensional stable anode (DSA), which consumes a large amount of noble metal of Ru and Ir. It is thus necessary to develop new types of catalysts. In this study, an organocatalyst anchored on the single&#8208;atom support (SAS) is put forward. It exhibits high catalytic efficiency towards both HER and CER with an overpotential of 21&#8197;mV and 20&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With this catalyst on both electrodes, the energy consumption is cut down by 1.2&#8201;% compared with the commercial system under industrial conditions. Based on this novel catalyst and the high activity, the mechanism of modifying non&#8208;covalent interaction is demonstrated to be reliable for the catalyst's design.

     alt="Organocatalyst Supported by a Single-Atom Support Accelerates both Electrodes used in the Chlor-Alkali Industry via Modification of Non-Covalent Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing a bridge between single-atom catalysts and organocatalysts, organic molecules anchored on single-atom supports exhibit high efficiency, durability, and bifunctional properties on both electrodes used in the chlor-alkali industry. This work not only provides an alternative choice for the chlor-alkali industry but also provides a new platform to study the catalyst consist inorganic and organic species together, which performs well in both reduction and oxidation process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consuming one of the largest amount of electricity, the chlor-alkali industry supplies basic chemicals for society, which mainly consists of two reactions, hydrogen evolution (HER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Till now, the state-of-the-art catalyst applied in this field is still the dimensional stable anode (DSA), which consumes a large amount of noble metal of Ru and Ir. It is thus necessary to develop new types of catalysts. In this study, an organocatalyst anchored on the single-atom support (SAS) is put forward. It exhibits high catalytic efficiency towards both HER and CER with an overpotential of 21&#8197;mV and 20&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With this catalyst on both electrodes, the energy consumption is cut down by 1.2&#8201;% compared with the commercial system under industrial conditions. Based on this novel catalyst and the high activity, the mechanism of modifying non-covalent interaction is demonstrated to be reliable for the catalyst's design. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for the chlor-alkali industry but also points out that the SACs can also act as support, providing new twists for the development of SACs and organic molecules in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Carboamination of Aminodienes to N&#8208;Heterocycles via C&#8722;N Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes via C&#8722;N bond activation enabled by a unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system is described. This reaction features high atom&#8208;economy and provides rapid access to a range of pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives.







Abstract
The catalytic transformation of ubiquitous but inert C&#8722;N bonds is highly appealing in synthetic chemistry, but the efficient cleaving inert C&#8722;N bond and simultaneous incorporation of both the cleaved C&#8208;moiety and N&#8208;moiety into the desired products has been a long&#8208;standing formidable challenge so far. Here, we developed a radical&#8208;addition triggered cyclization and C&#8722;N bond cleavage process enabled by the unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system, allowing the formal insertion of diene into the inert C&#8722;N bond. This reaction features high atom economy and enables an expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes to diverse pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the reaction is initiated via the generation of a benzyl radical and the formation of quaternary ammonium salt is key for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.

         <title>Stabilizing Sulfur Sites in Tetraoxygen Tetrahedral Coordination Structure for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetraoxygen tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside NiO is produced by encapsulating S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide. This unique structure could trigger a S&#8208;promoted lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (SLOM) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which greatly elevated the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ion regulation strategy is regarded as a promising pathway for designing transition metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with improved activity and stability. Precise anion conditioning can accurately change the anionic environment so that the acid radical ions (SO42&#8722;, PO32&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, etc.), regardless of their state (inside the catalyst, on the catalyst surface, or in the electrolyte), can optimize the electronic structure of the cationic active site and further increase the catalytic activity. Herein, we report a new approach to encapsulate S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide NiO to form a tetraoxo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside the NiO (S&#8208;NiO&#8201;&#8208;I). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando vibrational spectroscopy proves that this kind of unique structure could achieve the S&#8208;O4 and Ni&#8208;S stable structure in S&#8208;NiO&#8208;I. Combining mass spectroscopy characterization, it could be confirmed that the S&#8208;O4 structure is the key factor for triggering the lattice oxygen exchange to participate in the OER process. This work demonstrates that the formation of tetraoxygen tetrahedral structure is a generalized key for boosting the OER performances of transition metal oxides.

         <title>The Effect of Torsional Motion on Multiexciton Formation through Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Ferrocene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene(Fc)&#8208;terminated phenylene&#8208;bridged pentacene (Pc) dimers were synthesized to examine the effect of torsional motion on quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission. The optimized dimer exhibits an efficient 5TT yield together with quantitative singlet triplet pair (1TT) generation. The torsional motion in 1TT is ascribed to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc unit.







Abstract
A series of ferrocene(Fc)&#8208;bridged pentacene(Pc)&#8208;dimers [Fc&#8722;Ph(2,n)&#8722;(Pc)2: n=number of phenylene spacers] were synthesized to examine the tortional motion effect of Fc&#8208;terminated phenylene linkers on strongly coupled quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission (ISF). Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 has a relatively small electronic coupling and large conformational flexibility according to spectroscopic and theoretical analyses. Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 exhibits a high&#8208;yield 5TT together with quantitative singlet TT (1TT) generation through ISF. This demonstrates a much more efficient ISF than those of other less flexible Pc dimers. The activation entropy in 1TT spin conversion of Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 is larger than those of the other systems due to the larger conformational flexibility associated with the torsional motion of the linkers. The torsional motion of linkers in 1TT is attributable to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc due to hybridization of the hole level of Pc to Fc in 1TT unpaired orbitals.

         <title>Thermally Healable Electrolyte&#8208;Electrode Interface for Sustainable Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by jellies, we design a dynamically healable hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can effectively repair the inherent non&#8208;conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to form a stable conformal solid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8208;ion batteries using hydrogel electrolytes show great potential in energy storage devices owing to their intrinsic safety, fewer side reactions and wide electrochemical windows. However, the dendrite issues on the zinc anodes cannot be fundamentally eliminated and the intrinsic anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspace is rarely investigated. Here, we design a dynamically healable gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can construct a conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and further evolve into a stable solid&#8208;solid interface by in situ solidification. The unique helical gelatin chain structure provides a uniform channel for zinc ion transport by the bridging effect of sulfate groups. As a consequence, the dynamically healable interface enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes and repeatedly repairs the anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspaces by the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition of gelatin electrolyte to retain long&#8208;lasting protection for sustainable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

We synthesized poly(ionic liquid)s to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network that passivates the wide&#8208;band gap perovskite/electron transport layer interface and inhibits ion migration. The optimized devices achieve impressive efficiencies with outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. The textured perovskite/Si tandem cell also reaches a remarkable champion efficiency maintaining exceptional operational stability.







Abstract
The pursuit of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices, is a key focus in achieving the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. In this study, we initially designed poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) with varying alkyl chain lengths based on density functional theory calculations. Results pinpoint that PILs with longer alkyl chain lengths tend to exhibit more robust binding energy with the perovskite structure. Then we synthesized the PILs to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network (HHPN) that passivates the WBG perovskite/electron transport layer interface, inhibits ion migration and serves as a barrier layer against water and oxygen ingression. Accordingly, the HHPN effectively curbs nonradiative recombination losses while facilitating efficient carrier transport, resulting in substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor. As a result, the optimized single&#8208;junction WBG PSC achieves an impressive efficiency of 23.18&#8201;%, with Voc as high as 1.25&#8197;V, which is the highest reported for WBG (over 1.67&#8197;eV) PSCs. These devices also demonstrate outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. Notably, this versatile strategy can be extended to textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 28.24&#8201;% while maintaining exceptional operational stability.

         <title>Stereoselective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides Using Salen Aluminum Catalysts: A Route to High&#8208;Isotactic Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the stereoselective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6&#8197;kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a isotactic crystalline poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polythioesters are important sustainable polymers with broad applications. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (SCAs) can afford polythioesters with functional groups that are typically difficult to prepare by ROP of thiolactones. Typical methods involving organocatalysts, like dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et3N), have been plagued by uncontrolled polymerization, including epimerization for most SCAs resulting in the loss of isotacticity. Here, we report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the selective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6&#8197;kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a isotactic crystalline poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6&#8201;&#176;C. Effective ligand tailoring governs the binding affinity between the sulfide chain&#8208;end and the metal center, thereby maintaining the activity of organometallic catalysts and reducing the occurrence of epimerization reactions.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Derived Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mesoionic, six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins derived from 3&#8208;methylpyridinium ions (py&#8208;mNHOs) is reported. Py&#8208;mNHOs are among the most reactive neutral nucleophiles on the Mayr scale. Additionally, they are 1,3&#8208;dipoles that undergo dearomative (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions with dipolarophiles. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to analyze the gradual transition from stepwise adduct formation to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
Mesoionic polarization allows access to electron&#8208;rich olefins that have found application as organocatalysts, ligands, or nucleophiles. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of 3&#8208;methylpyridinium&#8208;derived mesoionic olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs). We used a DFT&#8208;supported design concept, which showed that the introduction of aryl groups in the 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, 4&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions of the heterocyclic core allowed the kinetic stabilization of the novel mesoionic compounds. Tolman electronic parameters indicate that py&#8208;mNHOs are remarkably strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligands toward transition metals and main group Lewis acids. Additionally, they are among the strongest nucleophiles on the Mayr reactivity scale. In reactions of py&#8208;mNHOs with electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems, a gradual transition from the formation of zwitterionic adducts via stepwise to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions was observed experimentally and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Polydentate Ligand Reinforced Chelating to Stabilize Buried Interface toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy is proposed to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The BTP&#8208;modified device achieves a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63&#8201;%. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;% of their initial PCE values after over 3000&#8197;h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728&#8197;h of thermal stress, respectively.







Abstract
The instability of the buried interface poses a serious challenge for commercializing perovskite photovoltaic technology. Herein, we report a polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl)phosphonate (BTP) is employed to manipulate the buried interface. The C=O, P=O and two &#8722;CF3 functional groups in BTP synergistically passivate the defects from the surface of SnO2 and the bottom surface of the perovskite layer. Moreover, The BTP modification contributes to mitigated interfacial residual tensile stress, promoted perovskite crystallization, and reduced interfacial energy barrier. The multidentate ligand modulation strategy is appropriate for different perovskite compositions. Due to much reduced nonradiative recombination and heightened interface contact, the device with BTP yields a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies ever reported for devices fabricated in the air environment. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;% of their initial PCE values after over 3000&#8197;h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728&#8197;h of thermal stress, respectively. This work provides insights into strengthening the stability of the buried interface by engineering multidentate chelating ligand molecules.

         <title>Strain&#8208;modulated Ru&#8208;O Covalency in Ru&#8208;Sn Oxide Enabling Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation in Acidic Solution</title>

Tensile strain applied to RuO6 octahedron optimizes the AEM reaction pathway and prohibits the LOM reaction pathway, leading to efficient and stable water oxidation in acidic solution.







Abstract
RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8722;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8722;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 and required merely 184&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 150&#8197;h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.

In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8722;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8722;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long-term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1&#8197;M HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and required merely 184&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for at least 150&#8197;h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru-based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Polymerization for Facile Aqueous&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report an ionic liquid&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization for designing highly crystalline enzyme&#8208;covalent organic framework (COF) biocatalysts. The highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; affords the hosted lipase with non&#8208;native catalytic selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. While the high photocatalytic activity of crystalline COF enables us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled nanoreactor for pollutants degradation.







Abstract
Utilizing covalent organic framework (COF) as a hypotoxic and porous scaffold to encapsulate enzyme (enzyme@COF) has inspired numerous interests at the intersection of chemistry, materials, and biological science. In this study, we report a convenient scheme for one&#8208;step, aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis of highly crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts. This facile approach relies on an ionic liquid (2&#8197;&#956;L of imidazolium ionic liquid)&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization mechanism, which can facilitate the in situ assembly of enzyme@COF under mild conditions. This green strategy is adaptive to synthesize different biocatalysts with highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221;, as well evidenced by the low&#8208;dose cryo&#8208;EM and other characterizations. Attributing to the rigorous sieving effect of crystalline COF pore, the hosted lipase shows non&#8208;native selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. In addition, the highly crystalline linkage affords COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; with higher photocatalytic activity for in situ production of H2O2, enabling us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled reactor for pollutants degradation, with a 2.63&#8208;fold degradation rate as the poorly crystalline photo&#8208;enzyme reactor. This work showcases the great potentials of employing green and trace amounts of ionic liquid for one&#8208;step synthesis of crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts, and emphasizes the feasibility of diversifying enzyme functions by integrating the reticular chemistry of a COF.

         <title>Stabilizing *CO2 Intermediates at the Acidic Interface using Molecularly Dispersed Cobalt Phthalocyanine as Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Without the assistance of metal cations, CoPc@CNT itself stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface, and thus enables CO2 conversion in pure acid, even at pH=1. As for Au/Ag, CO2 adsorption step is completely suppressed by the high coverage of H, causing only hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.







Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) operating in acidic media circumvents the problems of carbonate formation and CO2 crossover in neutral/alkaline electrolyzers. Alkali cations have been universally recognized as indispensable components for acidic CO2R, while they cause the inevitable issue of salt precipitation. It is therefore desirable to realize alkali&#8208;cation&#8208;free CO2R in pure acid. However, without alkali cations, stabilizing *CO2 intermediates by catalyst itself at the acidic interface poses as a challenge. Herein, we first demonstrate that a carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc@CNT) catalyst provides the Co single&#8208;atom active site with energetically localized d states to strengthen the adsorbate&#8208;surface interactions, which stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface (pH=1). As a result, we realize CO2 conversion to CO in pure acid with a faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% at pH=2 in flow cell. Furthermore, CO2 is successfully converted in cation exchanged membrane&#8208;based electrode assembly with a faradaic efficiency of 73&#8201;%. For CoPc@CNT, acidic conditions also promote the intrinsic activity of CO2R compared to alkaline conditions, since the potential&#8208;limiting step, *CO2 to *COOH, is pH&#8208;dependent. This work provides a new understanding for the stabilization of reaction intermediates and facilitates the designs of catalysts and devices for acidic CO2R.

         <title>Step&#8208;growth Polymerization of Aziridines with Elemental Sulfur: Easy Access to Linear Polysulfides and Their Use as Recyclable Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear polysulfides are prepared through a highly efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization of bis(N&#8208;sulfonyl/carbonyl aziridine) with elemental sulfur in the presence of organobase. The blend of the produced polysulfides with pyridine shows exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates.







Abstract
The bulk radical polymerization of bis(aziridine) with molten elemental sulfur resulted in brittle, cross&#8208;linked polymers. However, when the bis(aziridine) was treated with elemental sulfur in the presence of an organobase, the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine with oligosulfide anions occurred, leading to the formation of linear polymers by step&#8208;growth polymerization. These newly synthesized polymers possess repeating units containing a sulfonamide or amide functional moiety and oligosulfide bonds with an average sulfur segment of about two. A small molecular model reaction confirmed the nucleophilic addition reaction of elemental sulfur to aziridine. It was verified that S&#8722;S dynamic bond exchange takes place in the presence of an organic base within the linear chains. The mixture of the synthesized polysulfides with pyridine exhibits exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates. Notably, these prepared adhesives displayed good reusability due to the dynamic S&#8722;S exchange and complete recyclability due to their solution processability. This elemental sulfur&#8208;involved polymerization approach represents an innovative method for the synthesis of advanced sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, demonstrating the potential for various applications in adhesives and beyond.

         <title>Multimodal Engineering of Catalytic Interfaces Confers Multi&#8208;Site Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Internal Preconcentration and Accelerating Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multi&#8208;site catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, i.e., MSC&#8208;MOFs, were developed through molecular&#8208;level multimodal engineering. MSC&#8208;MOFs possess specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces within nanocages designed to internally preconcentrate polysulfides and facilitate redox reaction through multi&#8208;site chemical interactions, rendering lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with significantly optimized capacities and lifetimes, along with a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell of 350.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient catalysts to address the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a series of multi&#8208;site catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MSC&#8208;MOFs) were elaborated through multimodal molecular engineering to regulate both the reactant diffusion and catalysis processes. MSC&#8208;MOFs were crafted with nanocages featuring collaborative specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces formed by exposed mixed&#8208;valence metal sites and surrounding adsorption sites.

&lt;p&gt;A series of multi-site catalytic metal-organic frameworks, i.e., MSC-MOFs, were developed through molecular-level multimodal engineering. MSC-MOFs possess specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces within nanocages designed to internally preconcentrate polysulfides and facilitate redox reaction through multi-site chemical interactions, rendering lithium-sulfur batteries with significantly optimized capacities and lifetimes, along with a high-energy-density pouch cell of 350.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of highly efficient catalysts to address the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a series of multi-site catalytic metal-organic frameworks (MSC-MOFs) were elaborated through multimodal molecular engineering to regulate both the reactant diffusion and catalysis processes. MSC-MOFs were crafted with nanocages featuring collaborative specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces formed by exposed mixed-valence metal sites and surrounding adsorption sites. This design facilitates internal preconcentration, a coadsorption mechanism, and continuous efficient catalytic conversion toward polysulfides concurrently. Leveraging these attributes, LSBs with an MSC-MOF-Ti catalytic interlayer demonstrated a 62&#8201;% improvement in discharge capacity and cycling stability. This resulted in achieving a high areal capacity (11.57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at a high sulfur loading (9.32&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under lean electrolyte conditions, along with a pouch cell exhibiting an ultra-high gravimetric energy density of 350.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Lastly, this work introduces a universal strategy for the development of a new class of efficient catalytic MOFs, promoting SRR and suppressing the shuttle effect at the molecular level. The findings shed light on the design of advanced porous catalytic materials for application in high-energy LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymeric Metal Halides with Bright Luminescence and Versatile Processability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of polycations into metal halides as A&#8208;site cations results in a series of polymeric metal halides with bright luminescence and versatile processability. This bottom&#8208;up approach retains the excellent luminescent properties of inorganic metal&#8208;halogen units while introducing the desirable plasticity and processability of polymers.







Abstract
Most of current metal halide materials, including all inorganic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids, are crystalline materials with poor workability and plasticity that limit their application scope. Here, we develop a novel class of materials termed polymeric metal halides (PMHs) through introducing polycations into antimony&#8208;based metal halide materials as A&#8208;site cations. A series of PMHs with orange&#8208;yellow broadband emission and large Stokes shift originating from inorganic self&#8208;trapped excitons are successfully prepared, which meanwhile exhibit the excellent processability and formability of polymers. The versatility of these PMHs is manifested as the broad choices of polycations, the ready extension to manganese&#8208; and copper&#8208;based halides, and the tolerance to molar ratios between polycations and metal halides in the formation of PMHs. The merger of polymer chemistry and inorganic chemistry thus provides a novel generic platform for the development of metal halide functional materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;lifespan Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitors Enabled by Anodes Integrated with Interconnected Mesoporous Chitosan Membranes through Electrophoresis&#8208;driven Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of highly secure and inexpensive aqueous zinc ion energy storage devices is impeded by issues, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and corrosion of zinc anodes. It is essential to modify the interface of zinc anodes that homogenizes ion flux and facilitates highly reversible zinc planarized deposition and stripping. Herein, by coupling zinc ion coordination with acid&#8208;base neutralization under the driving of electrophoresis, manageable mesoscopic phase separation for constructing chitosan frameworks was achieved, thereby fabricating  interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes. The framework is constructed by twisted chitosan nanofiber bundles, forming a three&#8208;dimensional continuous spindle&#8208;shaped pore structure. With this framework, the electrolyte provides exceptional ion conductivity of 25.1 mS cm&#8208;1, with a puncture resistance strength of 2.3 GPa. In addition, the amino groups of chitosan molecule can make the surface of the framework positively charged.Thus, reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation. As a result, as&#8208;assembled zinc ion capacitor has an excellent cycle life and sustains the capacity by over 95% after 20000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g&#8208;1. This research presents a constructive strategy for stable electrolytes&#8208;integrated zinc anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Functionalization of Bicycloalkanes, Cubanes and Related Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review aims to provide an overview on the recent photochemical strategies for the construction and/or functionalization of bicycloalkanes, cubanes, and some of their heterocyclic structural analogues. The synthetic methods have been organized according to the molecular target, and with a particular emphasis on the type of photochemical mechanisms involved. Future perspectives and open synthetic challenges within the field are presented.







Abstract
Bicycloalkanes, cubanes and their structural analogues have emerged as bioisosteres of (hetero)arenes. To meet increasing demand, the chemical community has developed a plethora of novel synthetic methods. In this review, we assess the progress made in the field of light&#8208;driven construction and functionalization of such relevant molecules. We have focused on diverse structural targets, as well as on reaction processes giving access to: (i) [1.1.1]&#8208;bicyclopentanes (BCPs); (ii) [2.2.1]&#8208;bicyclohexanes (BCHs); (iii) [3.1.1]&#8208;bicycloheptanes (BCHeps); and (iv) cubanes; as well as other structurally related scaffolds. Finally, future perspectives dealing with the identification of novel reaction manifolds to access new functionalized bioisosteric units are discussed.

         <title>Kinetic Asymmetry and Directionality of Nonequilibrium Molecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratchet mechanisms allow external energy to drive pumping or directional motion on the ground state. An energy ratchet uses external modulation to destroy correlations present at equilibrium and an information ratchet uses catalysis and allosteric interactions to create correlations between the energy profile and occupancy of a binding site. A key design principle is kinetic asymmetry&#8212;a difference in barrier heights in the two states of the energy profile.







Abstract
Scientists have long been fascinated by the biomolecular machines in living systems that process energy and information to sustain life. The first synthetic molecular rotor capable of performing repeated 360&#176; rotations due to a combination of photo&#8208; and thermally activated processes was reported in 1999. The progress in designing different molecular machines in the intervening years has been remarkable, with several outstanding examples appearing in the last few years. Despite the synthetic accomplishments, there remains confusion regarding the fundamental design principles by which the motions of molecules can be controlled, with significant intellectual tension between mechanical and chemical ways of thinking about and describing molecular machines. A thermodynamically consistent analysis of the kinetics of several molecular rotors and pumps shows that while light driven rotors operate by a power&#8208;stroke mechanism, kinetic asymmetry&#8212;the relative heights of energy barriers&#8212;is the sole determinant of the directionality of catalysis driven machines. Power&#8208;strokes&#8212;the relative depths of energy wells&#8212;play no role whatsoever in determining the sign of the directionality. These results, elaborated using trajectory thermodynamics and the nonequilibrium pump equality, show that kinetic asymmetry governs the response of many non&#8208;equilibrium chemical phenomena.

         <title>Reshaping Echinocandin Antifungal Drugs To Circumvent Glucan Synthase Point&#8208;Mutation&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A docking&#8208;based model elucidates how echinocandins form a ternary complex with their glucan synthase target and associated membrane lipids. Removing hemiaminal alcohol from echinocandins reduced, and benzylic dehydroxylation improved potency against echinocandin&#8208;resistant yeast. Candida strains exposed to rezafungin or its dehydroxylated derivative, RZF&#8208;1, evolved resistance, with RZF&#8208;1 showing significantly higher potency against these strains.







Abstract
Echinocandins are a class of antifungal drugs that inhibit the activity of the &#946;&#8208;(1,3)&#8208;glucan synthase complex, which synthesizes fungal cell wall &#946;&#8208;(1,3)&#8208;glucan. Echinocandin resistance is linked to mutations in the FKS gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the glucan synthase complex. We present a molecular&#8208;docking&#8208;based model that provides insight into how echinocandins interact with the target Fks protein: echinocandins form a ternary complex with both Fks and membrane lipids. We used reductive dehydration of alcohols to generate dehydroxylated echinocandin derivatives and evaluated their potency against a panel of Candida pathogens constructed by introducing resistance&#8208;conferring mutations in the FKS gene. We found that removing the hemiaminal alcohol, which drives significant conformational alterations in the modified echinocandins, reduced their efficacy. Conversely, eliminating the benzylic alcohol of echinocandins enhanced potency by up to two orders of magnitude, in a manner dependent upon the resistance&#8208;conferring mutation. Strains that have developed resistance to either rezafungin, the most recently clinically approved echinocandin, or its dehydroxylated derivative RZF&#8208;1, exhibit high resistance to rezafungin while demonstrating moderate resistance to RZF&#8208;1. These findings provide valuable insight for combating echinocandin resistance through chemical modifications.

Removing hemiaminal alcohol from echinocandins reduced, and benzylic dehydroxylation improved potency against echinocandin-resistant yeast. &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; strains exposed to rezafungin or its dehydroxylated derivative, RZF-1, evolved resistance, with RZF-1 showing significantly higher potency against these strains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echinocandins are a class of antifungal drugs that inhibit the activity of the &#946;-(1,3)-glucan synthase complex, which synthesizes fungal cell wall &#946;-(1,3)-glucan. Echinocandin resistance is linked to mutations in the &lt;i&gt;FKS&lt;/i&gt; gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the glucan synthase complex. We present a molecular-docking-based model that provides insight into how echinocandins interact with the target Fks protein: echinocandins form a ternary complex with both Fks and membrane lipids. We used reductive dehydration of alcohols to generate dehydroxylated echinocandin derivatives and evaluated their potency against a panel of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; pathogens constructed by introducing resistance-conferring mutations in the &lt;i&gt;FKS&lt;/i&gt; gene. We found that removing the hemiaminal alcohol, which drives significant conformational alterations in the modified echinocandins, reduced their efficacy. Conversely, eliminating the benzylic alcohol of echinocandins enhanced potency by up to two orders of magnitude, in a manner dependent upon the resistance-conferring mutation. Strains that have developed resistance to either rezafungin, the most recently clinically approved echinocandin, or its dehydroxylated derivative RZF-1, exhibit high resistance to rezafungin while demonstrating moderate resistance to RZF-1. These findings provide valuable insight for combating echinocandin resistance through chemical modifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton Reaction Mediated by Atomically Dispersed Ag&#8722;Co Photocatalysts toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction by in situ generation of H2O2, with dual atoms sites for accelerating photoinduced charge separation and forming the Fenton&#8208;redox centers by the Ag and Co single atoms, respectively, generating the free radicals of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and non&#8208;radicals of singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to the complete mineralization of organics in wastewater.







Abstract
Achieving the complete mineralization of persistent pollutants in wastewater is still a big challenge. Here, we propose an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for the degradation of different pollutants using the high&#8208;density (Ag: 22&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of atomically dispersed AgCo dual sites embedded in graphic carbon nitride (AgCo&#8722;CN). Comprehensive experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag and Co dual sites in AgCo&#8722;CN play a critical role in accelerating the photoinduced charge separation and forming the self&#8208;Fenton redox centers, respectively. The bimetallic AgCo&#8722;CN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance toward the phenol even under extreme conditions due to an efficient degradation pathway and in situ generation of the hydrogen peroxide producing the main active oxygen species (&#8901;OH and 1O2) and showed long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for the purification of the phenol. Our discoveries pave the way for the design of efficient single&#8208;atoms photocatalysts&#8208;based photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for recalcitrant pollutant treatment.

         <title>Pentazolate Anion: A Rare and Preferred Five&#8208;Membered Ligand for Constructing Pentasil&#8208;Zeolite Topology Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The penta&#8208;coordinated pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) can be viewed as an enlarged pentagon. Three zeolitic or zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks (MPFs) were assembled under different auxiliary ligands and solvent environments. They both feature pentagonal building units composed of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anions, implying the unique potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; for constructing pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies.







Abstract
As the fourth full&#8208;nitrogen structure, the pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) was highly coveted for decades. In 2017, the first air&#8208;stable non&#8208;metal pentazolate salt, (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl, was obtained, representing a milestone in this field. As the latest member of the azole family, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; is comprised of five nitrogen atoms. Although significant attention has been paid to the potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; as an energetic material, its poor thermostability hinders any practical application. However, the unique ring structure and multiple coordination capability of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; provide a platform for the fabrication of various structures, among which pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are the most intriguing. In addition, the introduction of structure&#8208;directing auxiliaries enables the self&#8208;assembly of diverse topological architectures, potentially imparting cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; with the potential to impact wide&#8208;ranging areas of coordination chemistry and topology. In this minireview, different pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies based on metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks are evaluated. To date, three zeolitic and zeolite&#8208;like topologies have been reported, namely the melanophlogite (MEP), chibaite (MTN), and unj topologies. The MEP topology consists of two nanocages, Na20N60 and Na24N60, whereas the MTN topology contains Na20N60 and Na28N80 nanocages. Furthermore, the unj topology features multiple homochiral channels consisting of two helical chains. Various possible strategies for obtaining additional pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are also discussed.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Synthesis of Amine&#8208;Free CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets for Stable, Pure&#8208;Blue Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first amine&#8208;free synthesis route for CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPL). The designated ligands provide steric control and prevent the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth in amine&#8208;free route. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the ligand binds more strongly on NPLs compared with ammonium ligands. The resulting NPLs&#8217; stability against severe heating is 10&#8197;times higher than the best&#8208;reported pure&#8208;blue NPLs.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) have demonstrated excellent optical properties for light&#8208;emitting applications and achieved tunable blue luminescence through thickness control. However, their translation into electronic devices has lagged behind due to poor colloidal and film stability. The main reason for this is the deprotonation of their surface&#8208;capped ammonium passivating ligands, resulting in NPL aggregation. Here we report the first facile synthesis of amine&#8208;free pure&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 NPLs with outstanding thermal and light stability. This is achieved by utilizing an amine&#8208;free phosphine oxide route with a surface capping molecule exhibiting large steric hindrance to prevent NPL aggregation. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D&#8197;NMR) spectroscopy suggests slower ligand exchange in amine&#8208;free NPLs compared to the conventional NPLs, which can be attributed to the strong binding strength of the designated ligand. Consequently, the amine&#8208;free NPLs exhibited superior stability against radiation, heat and moisture. We further demonstrate the importance of acid&#8208;base equilibrium in this amine&#8208;free synthesis route. Through solvent neutralization and passivation with various alkali carbonates, the resulting NPLs attained near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and pure blue emission.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Deaminative Trifluoromethylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct deaminative trifluoromethylation of inactivated aliphatic primary amines with N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) under blue light irradiation is reported. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance and can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into organic molecules is of paramount importance in modern synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. While methods for constructing C(sp2)&#8722;CF3 bonds have been well established, the advancement of practical and comprehensive approaches for forming C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bonds remains considerably restricted. In this work, we describe an efficient and site&#8208;specific deaminative trifluoromethylation reaction of aliphatic primary amines to afford the corresponding alkyl trifluoromethyl compounds. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with readily accessible N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) under blue light. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and moderate to good yields. Remarkably, the method can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies were conducted, and a radical mechanism is proposed, wherein the dual roles of Grushin's reagent have been elucidated.

While methods for constructing C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bonds have been well established, the advancement of practical and comprehensive approaches for forming C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bonds remains considerably restricted. In this work, we describe an efficient and site-specific deaminative trifluoromethylation reaction of aliphatic primary amines to afford the corresponding alkyl trifluoromethyl compounds. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with readily accessible &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench-stable bpyCu(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;-bipyridine) under blue light. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and moderate to good yields. Remarkably, the method can be applied to the direct, late-stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies were conducted, and a radical mechanism is proposed, wherein the dual roles of Grushin's reagent have been elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery and Mechanistic Elucidation of NQO1&#8208;Bioactivatable Small Molecules That Overcome Resistance to Degraders</title>

The small molecule RBS&#8208;10 exploits a novel synthetic lethal vulnerability in cancer cells that show widespread resistance to degraders.







Abstract
Degraders hold the promise to efficiently inactivate previously intractable disease&#8208;relevant targets. Unlike traditional inhibitors, degraders act substoichiometrically and rely on the hijacked proteolysis machinery, which can also act as an entry point for resistance. To fully harness the potential of targeted protein degradation, it is crucial to comprehend resistance mechanisms and formulate effective strategies to overcome them. We conducted a chemical screening to identify synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cancer cells that exhibit widespread resistance to degraders. Comparative profiling followed by tailored optimization delivered the small molecule RBS&#8208;10, which shows preferential cytotoxicity against cells pan&#8208;resistant to degraders. Multiomics deconvolution of the mechanism of action revealed that RBS&#8208;10 acts as a prodrug bioactivated by the oxidoreductase enzyme NQO1, which is highly overexpressed in our resistance models. Collectively, our work informs on NQO1 as an actionable vulnerability to overcome resistance to degraders and as a biomarker to selectively exploit bioactivatable prodrugs in cancer.

         <title>An N&#8208;Heterocyclic Quinodimethane: A Strong Organic Lewis Base Exhibiting Diradical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of an N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ) is reported. In its closed&#8208;shell ground state, the NHQ is a strong organic base whose proton affinity exceeds that of analogous N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. Moreover, the NHQ exhibits radical reactivity and undergoes dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway.







Abstract
We report the preparation of a new organic &#963;&#8208;donor with a C6H4&#8208;linker between an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and an exocyclic methylidene group, which we term N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ). The aromatization of the C6H4&#8208;linker provides a decisive driving force for the reaction of the NHQ with an electrophile and renders the NHQ significantly more basic than analogous NHCs or N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), as shown by DFT computations and competition experiments. In solution, the NHQ undergoes an unprecedented dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization by C&#8722;C coupling of the methylidene groups. DFT computations indicate that this reaction proceeds via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway revealing the diradical character of the NHQ. The product of this dimerization can be described as conjugated N&#8208;heterocyclic bis&#8208;quinodimethane, which according to cyclic voltammetry is a strong organic reducing agent (E1/2=&#8722;1.71&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+) and exhibits a remarkable small singlet&#8211;triplet gap of &#916;ES&#8594;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Chiral Figure&#8208;Eight Macrocycles Using a Preorganized Natural Product&#8208;Based Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral D2&#8208;symmetric Figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, which exhibits bright CPL (glum=0.011, &#934;fl=0.74, BCPL=480), was efficiently synthesized using a versatile C2&#8208;symmetric natural product&#8208;based manifold with a preorganized conformation. This rapid and modular synthetic platform allows flexible and precise tuning of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores in shape&#8208;persistent figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.







Abstract
Chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles are promising scaffolds for amplifying the chiroptical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. By harnessing the inherent and adaptable conformational dynamics of a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric bispyrrolidinoindoline (BPI) manifold, we developed an enantio&#8208;divergent modular synthetic platform to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution. Notably, a 32&#8208;membered figure&#8208;eight macrocycle showed excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL: |glum|=1.1&#215;10&#8722;2) complemented by a robust emission quantum yield (&#934;fl=0.74), to achieve outstanding CPL brightness (BCPL: &#1013;&#215;&#934;fl&#215;|glum|/2=480). Using quadruple Sonogashira couplings, this versatile synthetic platform enables precise adjustments of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores. Our synthetic strategy offers a streamlined and systematic approach to significantly enhance BCPL values for a variety of chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.

         <title>Bidirectional Regulation of Intracellular Enzyme Activity Using Light&#8208;Driven Nano&#8208;Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;inhibitor (NIn) captures the target enzyme via non&#8208;covalent interactions and regulates its enzyme activity in a light&#8208;controlled manner. Specifically, the body of NIn recognizes and binds to the targeted enzyme. The arm of NIn generates a push&#8208;pull motion when irradiated with UV and Vis light, resulting in docking and undocking of the inhibitor at the enzyme active site.







Abstract
Photochemical regulation provides precise control over enzyme activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. A promising approach involves anchoring &#8220;photoswitches&#8221; at enzyme active sites to modulate substrate recognition. However, current methods often require genetic mutations and irreversible enzyme modifications for the site&#8208;specific anchoring of &#8220;photoswitches&#8221;, potentially compromising the enzyme activities. Herein, we present a pioneering reversible nano&#8208;inhibitor based on molecular imprinting technique for bidirectional regulation of intracellular enzyme activity. The nano&#8208;inhibitor employs a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticle as its body and azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors (&#8220;photoswitches&#8221;) as the arms. By using a target enzyme as the molecular template, the nano&#8208;inhibitor acquires oriented binding sites on its surface, resulting in a high affinity for the target enzyme and non&#8208;covalently firm anchoring of the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the enzyme active site. Harnessing the reversible isomerization of azobenzene units upon exposure to ultraviolet and visible light, the nano&#8208;inhibitor achieves bidirectional enzyme activity regulation by precisely docking and undocking inhibitor at the active site. Notably, this innovative approach enables the facile in situ regulation of intracellular endogenous enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Our results represent a practical and versatile tool for precise enzyme activity regulation in complex intracellular environments.

         <dc:description>
There is a pressing need for general, direct couplings of tertiary alkyl fragments to (hetero)aryl halides. Herein a uniquely powerful and simple set of conditions with unparalleled generality and regioselectivity is disclosed. This new protocol is compared to other recently reported methods, applied to simplify the routes of known building blocks, and scaled up in both batch and flow. Finally, preliminary mechanistic studies were carried out.







Abstract
There is a pressing need, particularly in the field of drug discovery, for general methods that will enable direct coupling of tertiary alkyl fragments to (hetero)aryl halides. Herein a uniquely powerful and simple set of conditions for achieving this transformation with unparalleled generality and chemoselectivity is disclosed. This new protocol is placed in context with other recently reported methods, applied to simplify the routes of known bioactive building blocks molecules, and scaled up in both batch and flow. The role of pyridine additive as well as the mechanism of this reaction are interrogated through Cyclic Voltammetry studies, titration experiments, control reactions with Ni(0) and Ni(II)&#8208;complexes, and ligand optimization data. Those studies indicate that the formation of a BINAPNi(0) is minimized and the formation of an active pyridine&#8208;stabilized Ni(I) species is sustained during the reaction. Our preliminary mechanistic studies ruled out the involvement of Ni(0) species in this electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling, which is mediated by Ni(I) species via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(III)&#8208;Ni(I) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Exploring the Fate of Copper Ions in the Synthesis of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where does the copper catalyst used for graphdiyne (GDY) synthesis finally go? It was found that these copper ions are tightly adsorbed on the atomic layer of GDY. Fortunately, they can be in situ converted into copper ultrathin nanocrystals and applied for pollutant enrichment and detection.







Abstract
Copper is a crucial catalyst in the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY). However, as catalysts, the final fate of the copper ions has hardly been concerned, which are usually treated as impurities. Here, it is observed that after simple washing with water and ethanol, GDY still contains a certain amount of copper ions, and demonstrated that the copper ions are adsorbed at the atomic layers of GDY. Furthermore, we transformed in situ the copper ions into ultrathin Cu nanocrystals, and the obtained Cu/GDY hybrids can be generally converted into a series of metal/GDY hybrid materials, such as Ag/GDY, Au/GDY, Pt/GDY, Pd/GDY, and Rh/GDY. The Cu/GDY hybrids exhibit extraordinary surface enhanced Raman scattering effect and can be applied in pollutant efficient enrichment and detection.

         <title>Reversible Postsynthetic Modification in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, reversible covalent postsynthetic modification (PSM) is demonstrated in a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MTV&#8208;MOF) using thermoreversible furan&#8208;maleimide Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. The MOF was modified with a pendant furan functional group that was then capable of undergoing repeated cycles of PSM and de&#8208;modification with different functionalized maleimides. Reversible PSM was achieved with complete retention of structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of the MOF.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provides access to functional materials and advanced porous solid engineering. Herein, we report the reversible PSM of a multivariate isoreticular MOF by applying dynamic furan&#8208;maleimide Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) chemistry. The key step involves incorporating a furan group into the MOF via &#8220;click&#8221; PSM, which can then undergo repeated cycles of modification and de&#8208;modification with maleimides. The structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of the furan&#8208;appended MOF remained intact even after three consecutive PSM/de&#8208;modification cycles using three different functionalized maleimides.

         <title>Competitive Coordination Structure Regulation in Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A competitive coordination structure to form a unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster for stable zinc batteries is reported. The altered coordination leads to a robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;based batteries are finding their niche in energy storage applications where cost, safety, scalability matter, yet they are plagued by rapid performance degradation due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to stabilize Zn anode. Herein, we report a competitive coordination structure to form unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster. Unraveled by experiment and calculation results, the competing component can enter initial primary coordination shell of Zn2+ ion, partially substituting Lewis basic eutectic ligands and reinforcing cation&#8208;anion interaction. The hydration&#8208;deficient complexes induced between competing eutectic as hydrogen bond donor&#8208;accepter and water also broaden the electrochemical window and confine free water activity. The altered coordination further leads to robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth. Noticeably, stable Zn plating/stripping for 8000 cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies of 99.6&#8201;% and long cycling life of 10000 cycles for Zn&#8208;organic batteries are obtained. Even under harsh conditions (small N/P ratio, low temperature), the profits brought by the competitive eutectic electrolyte are still very prominent. This design principle leveraged by eutectic electrolytes with competitive coordination offers a new approach to improve battery performance.

The Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide Nd2NiO4+&#948; exhibits magnetic anisotropy and oxygen transport anisotropy. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets.

         <title>Secondary&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Construction of a Polar Material Exhibiting Strong Broad&#8208;Spectrum Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven strategy for the construction of the first noncentrosymmetric vanadyl iodate lacking additional counter cations, VO2(H2O)(IO3), which possesses strong second&#8208;harmonic generation and sufficient birefringence, was reported.







Abstract
Considerable effort has been invested in the development of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) inorganic solids for ferroelectricity&#8208;, piezoelectricity&#8208; and, particularly, optical nonlinearity&#8208;related applications. While great progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty in constructing NCS materials, which probably stems from non&#8208;directionality and unsaturation of the ionic bonds between metal counter&#8208;cations and covalent anionic modules. We report herein a secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven approach that circumvents the cancellation of dipole moments between adjacent anionic modules that has plagued second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) material design, and which thereby affords a polar structure with strong SHG properties. The resultant first NCS counter&#8208;cation&#8208;free iodate, VO2(H2O)(IO3) (VIO), a new class of iodate, crystallizes in a polar lattice with 
VO2(H2O)(IO3)] zigzag chains connected by weak hydrogen bonds and intermolecular forces. VIO exhibits very large SHG responses (18 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1200&#8197;nm, 1.5 &#215; KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm) and sufficient birefringence (0.184 @ 546&#8197;nm). Calculations and crystal structure analysis attribute the large SHG responses to consistent polarization orientations of the 
VO2(H2O)(IO3)] chains controlled by secondary bonds. This study highlights the advantages of manipulating the secondary bonds in inorganic solids to control NCS structure and optical nonlinearity, affording a new perspective in the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

&lt;p&gt;A secondary-bond-driven strategy for the construction of the first noncentrosymmetric vanadyl iodate lacking additional counter cations, VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which possesses strong second-harmonic generation and sufficient birefringence, was reported.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable effort has been invested in the development of non-centrosymmetric (NCS) inorganic solids for ferroelectricity-, piezoelectricity- and, particularly, optical nonlinearity-related applications. While great progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty in constructing NCS materials, which probably stems from non-directionality and unsaturation of the ionic bonds between metal counter-cations and covalent anionic modules. We report herein a secondary-bond-driven approach that circumvents the cancellation of dipole moments between adjacent anionic modules that has plagued second-harmonic generation (SHG) material design, and which thereby affords a polar structure with strong SHG properties. The resultant first NCS counter-cation-free iodate, VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (VIO), a new class of iodate, crystallizes in a polar lattice with 
VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] zigzag chains connected by weak hydrogen bonds and intermolecular forces. VIO exhibits very large SHG responses (18 &#215; KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; @ 1200&#8197;nm, 1.5 &#215; KTiOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; @ 2100&#8197;nm) and sufficient birefringence (0.184 @ 546&#8197;nm). Calculations and crystal structure analysis attribute the large SHG responses to consistent polarization orientations of the 
VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)] chains controlled by secondary bonds. This study highlights the advantages of manipulating the secondary bonds in inorganic solids to control NCS structure and optical nonlinearity, affording a new perspective in the development of high-performance NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster/MXene Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoclusters loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) displays highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3RR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) provides a competitive manner for carbon neutrality and decentralized NH3 synthesis. Atomically precise nanoclusters, as an advantageous platform for investigating the NO3RR mechanisms and actual active sites, remain largely underexplored due to the poor stability. Herein, we report a (NH4)9[Ag9(mba)9] nanoclusters (Ag9 NCs) loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) for highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis with improved stability in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3. Besides, compared with individual Ag9 NCs, Ag9/MXene has better stability with the current density performed no decay after 108&#8197;hours of reaction. This work provides a strategy for improving the catalytic activity and stability of atomically precise metal NCs, expanding the mechanism research and application of metal NCs.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Ring with Inherent Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing efficient protocols to construct inherent chirality is highly desirable owing to its tremendous application in chiral recognition and enantioselective synthesis. Herein, we report the first enantioselective synthesis of 7&#8208;membered inherently chiral derivatives via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation. This chemistry highlights the broad substrate scope and excellent stereocontrol (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Inherent chirality is used to describe chiral cyclic molecules devoid of central, axial, planar, or helical chirality and has tremendous applications in chiral recognition and enantioselective synthesis. Catalytic and divergent syntheses of inherently chiral molecules have attracted increasing interest from chemists. Herein, we report the enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral tribenzocycloheptene derivatives via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed condensation of cyclic ketones and hydroxylamines. This chemistry paves the way to accessing the less stable derivatives of 7&#8208;membered rings with inherent chirality. A series of chiral tribenzocycloheptene oxime ethers was synthesized in good yields (up to 97&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>All&#8208;Round Ionic Liquids for Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile ionic liquid, EMIM[OAc], is employed for synchronous optimization of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries. The solvation structure involving OAc&#8722; and the EMIM+&#8208;induced IHP can suppress Zn anode corrosion. And EMIM+ is effective to inhibiting iodine dissolution and capturing polyiodides, thereby significantly mitigating shuttle effects.







Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) is hindered by the rampant Zn dendrites growth, parasite corrosion, and polyiodide shuttling. In this work, ionic liquid EMIM[OAc] is employed as an all&#8208;round solution to mitigate challenges on both the Zn anode and the iodine cathode side. First, the EMIM+ embedded lean&#8208;water inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and inert solvation sheath modulated by OAc&#8722; effectively repels H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. The preferential adsorption of EMIM+ on Zn metal facilitates uniform Zn nucleation via a steric hindrance effect. Second, EMIM+ can reduce the polyiodide shuttling by hindering the iodine dissolution and forming an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; dominated phase. These effects holistically enhance the cycle life, which is manifested by both Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Zn symmetric cells and Zn&#8208;I2 full cells. ZIBs with EAc deliver a capacity decay rate of merely 0.01 &#8240; per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and lower self&#8208;discharge and better calendar life than the ZIBs without ionic liquid EAc additive.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products are attractive components to tailor environmentally friendly advanced new materials. We present surface&#8208;confined metallosupramolecular engineering of coordination polymers using natural dyes as molecular building blocks: indigo and the related Tyrian purple. Both building blocks yield identical, well&#8208;defined coordination polymers composed of (1 dehydroindigo : 1 Fe) repeat units on two different silver single crystal surfaces. These polymers are characterized atomically by submolecular resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy, bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On Ag(100) and on Ag(111), the&#160;trans&#160;configuration of dehydroindigo results in N,O&#8208;chelation in the polymer chains. On the more inert Ag(111) surface, the molecules additionally undergo thermally induced isomerization from the&#160;trans&#160;to the&#160;cis&#160;configuration and afford N,N&#8208; plus O,O&#8208;chelation. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the coordination polymers of the&#160;cis&#8208;isomers on Ag(111) and of the&#160;trans&#8208;isomers on Ag(100) are energetically favoured. Our results demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic linker isomerization in interfacial metal&#8208;organic nanosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Bifunctional Chemoselective Metabolome Analysis of Liver Patient Samples Using the Reagent 4&#8208;Nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging. Derivatization of carboxylic acids represents a strategy to overcome these limitations but available methods suffer from diverse analytical challenges. Herein, we have designed a novel strategy introducing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine as a new chemoselective moiety for the first time for carboxylic acid metabolites. This moiety was selected as it rapidly forms a stable amide bond and also generates a new ketone, which can be analyzed by our recently developed&#160;quant&#8208;SCHEMA method specific for carbonyl metabolites. Optimization of this new method revealed a high reproducibility and robustness, which was utilized to validate 102 metabolic carboxylic acids using authentic synthetic standard conjugates in human plasma samples including nine metabolites that were newly detected. Using this sequential analysis of the carbonyl&#8208; and carboxylic acid&#8208;metabolomes revealed alterations of the ketogenesis pathway, which demonstrates the vast benefit of our unique methodology. We anticipate that the developed azirine moiety with rapid functional group transformation will find broad application in diverse chemical biology research fields.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging.

         <title>Unraveling the Chirality Transfer from Circularly Polarized Light to Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their broken symmetry, chiral plasmonic nanostructures have unique optical properties and multiple applications. However, there is still a lack of comprehension about how chirality transfer between circularly polarized light (CPL) and these structures occurs. Here, we thoroughly investigate the plasmon&#8208;assisted growth of chiral nanoparticles from achiral Au nanocubes (AuNCs) via CPL without the involvement of any chiral molecule stimulators. We identify the structural chirality of our synthesized chiral plasmonic nanostructures by using circular differential scattering (CDS) spectroscopy correlated with scanning electron microscopy imaging at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels. Theoretical simulations, including hot&#8208;electron surface maps, reveal that the plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer is mediated by the asymmetric distribution of hot electrons on achiral AuNCs under CPL excitation. Furthermore, we shed light on how this plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer can also be utilized for chiral growth in bimetallic systems, such as Ag or Pd on AuNCs. Results presented here reveal fundamental aspects of chiral light&#8208;matter interaction, influencing the future design and optimization of chiral sensors and chiral catalysis, among others.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hexa&#8208;Substituted Carpyridines into 1D Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extent of the influence that molecular curvature plays on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymers remains an open question in the field. We began addressing this fundamental question with the introduction of &#8220;carpyridines&#8221;, which are saddle&#8208;shaped monomers that can associate with one another through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and in which the rotational and translational movements are restricted. The topography displayed by the monomers led, previously, to the assembly of highly ordered 2D materials even in the absence of strong directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to gain control over the dimensionality of the formed structures yielding classical unidimensional polymers. These have been characterized using well&#8208;established protocols allowing us to determine and confirm the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of both fibers and sheets. The calculated interaction energies are significantly higher than expected for flexible self&#8208;assembling units lacking classical &#8220;strong&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions. The versatility of this supramolecular unit to assemble into either supramolecular fibers or 2D sheets with strong association energies highlights remarkably well the potential and importance of molecular shape for the design of supramolecular materials and the applications thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic H2 Generation: Controlled and Optimized Dispersion of Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts Based on Pt&#8208;TCPP Planar Adsorption on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When using single atoms (SAs) as a co&#8208;catalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation, achieving a well&#8208;dispersed, evenly distributed and adjustable SA surface density on a semiconductor surface is a challenging task. In the present work we use the planar adsorption of tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TCPP) and its platinum coordinated analogue, Pt&#8208;TCPP, onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to establish a spatially controlled decoration of SAs. We show that the surface Pt SA density can be very well controlled by co&#8208;adsorption of Pt&#8208;TCPP and TCPP in the planar monolayer regime, and by adjusting the Pt&#8208;TCCP to TCPP ratio a desired well dispersed surface density of SAs up to 2.6 &#215; 105 atoms &#181;m&#8208;2 can be established (which is the most effective Pt SA loading for photocatalysis). This distribution and the SA state is maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide and Enzyme Catalysts Work in Concert in Stereoselective Cascade Reactions &#8211; Oxidation Followed by Conjugate Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes and peptide catalysts consist of the same building blocks but require vastly different environments to operate best. Here, we show that an enzyme and a peptide catalyst can work together in a single reaction vessel to catalyze a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Abundant linear alcohols, nitroolefins, an alcohol oxidase, and a tripeptide catalyst provided chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes in aqueous buffer. High yields (up to 92%) and stereoselectivities (up to 98% ee) were achieved for the cascade through the rational design of the peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120 &#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1 GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406 MJ m&#8208;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal&#160;Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although clearance of senescent cells has been proved to slow down aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is engineering a galactose (Gal) moiety into dihydrotetrazine, which serves both as recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal) and a caging group for control of tetrazine activity. We demonstrate that Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of fluorescent HCA and doxorubicin (Dox) from TCO caged HCA and Dox prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce BRD4 degradation. The proof of concept of PROTACs as senolytics may offer an efficient way for intervention of cell senescence due to their unique capacity capable of degrading targeted proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of the study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.</dc:description>

The results of the study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic and Thermocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Propionaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction can convert CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, but its selectivity toward C3+ products are very limited. One possible solution is to run the reactions in hybrid processes by coupling electrocatalysis with other catalytic routes. In this contribution, we report the cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 to propionaldehyde. Using Cu(OH)2 nanowires as the precatalyst, CO2/H2O is reduced to concentrated C2H4, CO, and H2 gases in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor. The thermochemical hydroformylation reaction is separately investigated with a series of rhodium&#8208;phosphine complexes. The best candidate is identified to be the one with the 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane diphosphine ligand, which exhibits a propionaldehyde turnover number of 1148 under a mild temperature and close to atmospheric pressure. By coupling and optimizing the upstream CO2 electroreduction and downstream hydroformylation reaction, we achieve a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38% and a total C3 oxygenate selectivity of 44% based on reduced CO2. These values represent a more than seven times improvement over the best prior electrochemical system alone or over two times improvement over other hybrid systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Deep Mineralization of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep mineralization of low concentration toluene (C7H8) is one of the most significant but challenging reactions in photocatalysis. It is generally assumed that hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) as the main reactive species contribute to the enhanced photoactivity, however, it remains ambiguous at this stage. Herein, a S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction with AlOOH as water resistant surface layer is in situ designed for tuning the free radical species and achieving deep mineralization of C7H8. By employing a combination of in situ DRIFTS and materials characterization techniques, we discover that&#160;the dominant intermediates such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid instead of toxic phenols are formed under the action of holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (&#183;O2&#8208;). These dominant intermediates turn out to greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier. This study offers new possibilities for rationally tailoring the active species and thus directionally producing dominant intermediates via designing water resistant surface layer.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Templated Fabrication of Ultrathin Electroactive Gold Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generally, two&#8208;dimensional gold nanomaterials have unique properties and functions that offer exciting application prospects. However, the crystal phases of these materials tend to be limited to the thermodynamically stable crystal structure. Herein, we report a DNA framework&#8208;templated approach for the ambient aqueous synthesis of freestanding and microscale amorphous gold nanosheets with ultrathin sub&#8208;nanometer thickness. We observe that extended single&#8208;stranded DNA on DNA nanosheets can induce site&#8208;specific metallization and enable precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions. More importantly, the as&#8208;prepared gold nanosheets can serve as an electrocatalyst for glucose oxidase&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic activity (~ 3&#8208;fold) relative to discrete gold nanoclusters owing to a larger electrochemical active area and wider band gap. The proposed DNA framework&#8208;templated metallization strategy is expected to be applicable in a broad range of fields, from catalysis to new energy materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tapcin, an in vivo active dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitor discovered by syn&#8208;BNP coupled metagenomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA topoisomerases are attractive targets for anticancer agents. Dual topoisomerase I/II inhibitors are particularly appealing due to their reduced rates of resistance. A number of therapeutically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors are bacterial natural products. Mining the untapped chemical diversity encoded by soil microbiomes presents an opportunity to identify additional natural topoisomerase inhibitors. Here we couple metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and chemical synthesis to produce the dual topoisomerase inhibitor tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;thiazole with a rare tri&#8208;thiazole substructure and picomolar antiproliferative activity. Tapcin reduced colorectal adenocarcinoma HT&#8208;29 cell proliferation and tumor volume in mouse hollow fiber and xenograft models, respectively. In both studies it showed similar activity to the clinically used topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan. The study suggests that the interrogation of soil microbiomes using synthetic bioinformatic natural product methods has the potential to be a rewarding strategy for identifying potent, biomedically relevant, antiproliferative agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cyclophanes by Chiral Sulfide Catalyzed Electrophilic Sulfenylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes has been developed for the first time. This was achieved by using a new Lewis base catalyst and a new ortho&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted sulfenylating reagent. Using the substrates with low rotational energy barrier, the transformation proceeded through a dynamic kinetic resolution, and the high rotational energy barrier of the substrates allowed the reaction to undergo a kinetic resolution process. Meanwhile, this transformation was compatible with a desymmetrization process when the symmetric substrates were used. Various planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% yield and 95% ee). This approach was used to synthesize pharmaceutically relevant planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Density functional theory calculations showed that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the sulfenyl group and the aromatic ring in the substrate play a crucial role in enantioinduction in this sulfenylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Mechanical Properties of 3D&#8208;printed Objects by the RAFT Process: From Chain&#8208;Growth to Step&#8208;Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step&#8208;growth to chain&#8208;growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young&#8217;s moduli, ranging from 7.6 MPa to 997.1 MPa. Moreover, post&#8208;functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with specific and tunable properties.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step-growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step-growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step-growth to chain-growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young&#8217;s moduli, ranging from 7.6 MPa to 997.1 MPa. Moreover, post-functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor-made materials with specific and tunable properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Rapid Synthesis of MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Ni Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts&#160;(SACs) have attracted tremendous interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the common electric heating techniques to produce carbon&#8208;based SACs usually suffer from prolonged heating time and tedious operations. Herein, a general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based SACs within 3 min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon&#8208;based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C) derived from a Ni&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) exhibits remarkable CO&#160;Faradic efficiency (96%) with a substantial CO partial current density (jCO) up to 1.06 A/cm2 in CO2 electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that, the resulting Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO2 adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon&#8208;based materials for efficient catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Strained&#160;meso&#8208;meso&#8208;Linked Porphyrin Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained macrocycles display interesting properties, such as conformational rigidity, often resulting in enhance &#960;&#8208;conjugation or enhanced affinity for non&#8208;covalent guest binding, yet they can be difficult to synthesize. Here we use computational modeling to design a template to direct the formation of an 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring with direct&#160;meso&#8208;meso&#160;bonds between the porphyrin units. Coupling of a linear 18&#8208;porphyrin oligomer in the presence of this template gives the target nanoring, together with an unexpected 36&#8208;porphyrin ring by&#8208;product. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed the elliptical conformations and flexibility of these nanorings on a Au(111) surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonated Perylene as Three&#8208;in&#8208;One STING Agonist for Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) has been considered as a powerful immunotherapy strategy. While promising, the clinical translation of CDNs is still overwhelmed by its limited biostability and the resulting systemic immunotoxicity. Being differentiating from current application of exogenous CDNs to address these challenges, we herein developed one perylene STING agonist PDIC&#8208;NS, which not only promotes the production of endogenous CDNs but also inhibits its hydrolysis. More significantly, PDIC&#8208;NS can well reach lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and thus mitigates the systemic immunotoxicity upon intravenous administration. As a result, PDIC&#8208;NS had realized remarkable in vivo antitumor activity, and backward verified on STING knock out mice. Overall, this study states that PDIC&#8208;NS can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecule STING agonist characterized by promoting the content and biostability of endogenous CDNs as well as possessing good tissue specificity, and hence presents an innovative strategy and platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Deuterium Isotopes on Pt(II) Complexes and Their Impact on Organic NIR Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insight into effect of deuterium isotopes on organic near&#8208;IR (NIR) emitters was explored by the use of self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) complexes H&#8208;3&#8208;f and HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, and their deuterated analogues D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, respectively (Scheme 2). In vacuum deposited thin film, albeit having nearly identical emission spectral feature maximized at ~810 nm, H&#8208;3&#8208;f and D&#8208;3&#8208;f exhibit remarkable difference in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 29% and 50%, respectively. Distinction in PLQY is also observed for HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (800 nm, 50%) and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (798 nm, 67%). We then elucidated the theoretical differences in the impact on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence between Pt(II) complexes and organic small molecules upon deuteration. The results establish a general guideline for the deuteration on NIR emission efficiency. From a perspective of practical application, NIR OLEDs based on D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitters attain EQEmax of 15.5% (radiance 31,287 mW Sr&#8208;1 m&#8208;2) and 16.6% (radiance of 32,279 mW Sr&#8208;1 m&#8208;2) at 764 nm and 796 nm, respectively, both of which set new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt; 750 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes with Dual Negatively Curved Heptagons: Extensive Synthesis and Spontaneous Resolution into Strippable Homochiral Lamellae with Helical Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a unique category of &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with double negative curvatures. This is achieved by two&#8208;fold regioselective heptagonal cyclization of the oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole precursors through either intramolecular C&#8208;H arylation or Scholl reaction. The fusion of two heptagonal rings in the helical skeleton dramatically increases the intramolecular strain and forces the two terminal carbazole moieties to stack in a compressed fashion. The presence of the deformable negatively curved heptagonal rings endows the resulting diaza[7]helicenes with dynamic chiral skeletons, aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature and relatively low racemization barrier of ca. 25.6 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1. Further &#960;&#8208;extension on the carbazole moieties subsequently leads to a more sophisticated C2&#8208;symmetric homochiral triple helicene. Notably, these &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes show structure&#8208;dependent stacking upon crystallization, switching from heterochiral packing to intra&#8208;layer homochiral stacking. Interestingly, the C2&#8208;symmetric triple helicene molecules spontaneously resolve into a homochiral lamellar structure with 31 helix symmetry. Upon ultrasonication in a nonsolvent, the crystals can be readily exfoliated into large&#8208;area ultrathin nanosheets with height of ca. 4.4 nm corresponding to two layers of stacked triple helicene molecules and relatively thicker nanosheets constituted by even&#8208;numbered molecular lamellae. Moreover, regular hexagonal thin platelets with size larger than 30 &#956;m can be readily fabricated by flash aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Crystallization Modulation for Large&#8208;area High&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br Films and Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermally stable inorganic cesium&#8208;based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large&#8208;area black&#8208;phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen&#8208;bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large&#8208;area phase&#8208;pure films with much&#8208;reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant&#8208;free poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14% and 16.46% for 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24% under 1000 lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The thermally stable inorganic cesium-based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large-area black-phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen-bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large-area phase-pure films with much-reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large-area high-quality phase-pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant-free poly(3-hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record-high efficiencies of 18.14% and 16.46% for 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24% under 1000 lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the "Gap&#8208;Filling"&#160;Mechanism of Multiple Charge Carriers in Aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization rate of active sites in cathode materials for Zn&#8208;based batteries is a key factor determining the reversible capacities. However, a long&#8208;neglected issue of the strong electrostatic repulsions among divalent Zn2+ in hosts inevitably causes the squander of some active sites (i.e., gap sites). Herein, we address this conundrum by unraveling the "gap&#8208;filling"&#160;mechanism of multiple charge carriers in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. The tailored MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid features an ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing (2.34 nm), superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure, demonstrating highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in the 1 M ZnSO4 + 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The NH4+ and H+ ions can act as gap fillers to fully utilize the active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to accelerate the Zn2+ diffusion. Thus, unprecedentedly high rate capability (439.5 and 104.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 30 A g&#8722;1, respectively) and ultra&#8208;long cycling life (8000 cycles) are achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization Kinetics of Hybrid Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are considered ideal photovoltaic materials due to their variable crystal material composition and excellent photoelectric properties. However, this variability in composition leads to complex crystallization processes in the manufacturing of Metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin films, resulting in reduced crystallinity and subsequent performance loss in the final device. Thus, understanding and controlling the crystallization dynamics of perovskite materials are essential for improving the stability and performance of PSCs (Perovskite Solar Cells) .To investigate the impact of crystallization characteristics on the properties of MHP films and identify corresponding modulation strategies, we primarily discuss the relevant aspects of MHP crystallization kinetics, systematically summarize theoretical methods, and outline modulation techniques for MHP crystallization, including solution engineering, additive engineering, and component engineering, which helps highlight the prospects and current challenges in perovskite crystallization kinetics</dc:description>

         <title>Direct, Stereodivergent, and Catalytic Michael Additions of Thioimides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes &#8211; Total Synthesis of Tapentadol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct and stereodivergent Michael additions of N&#8208;acyl 1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes are reported. The reactions proceed with a remarkable regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, so access to any of the four potential Michael stereoisomers is granted through the appropriate choice of the chiral ligand of the nickel(II) complex. Simple removal of the heterocyclic scaffold furnishes a wide array of either syn or anti enantiomerically pure derivatives, which can be exploited for the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds, as demonstrated in a new approach to tapentadol. In turn, a mechanism, based on theoretical calculations, is proposed to account for the stereochemical outcome of these transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Species Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) solution has exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the luminance would be severely quenched when the PNC solution is assembled into thin films due to the agglomeration and fusion of NCs caused by the exfoliation of surface ligands and non&#8208;radiative F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from small to large particle sizes, which seriously affected the performances of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we used Guanidine thiocyanate (GASCN) and Sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) to achieve effective CsPbI3 PNC surface reconstruction. Due to the strong coordination ability of these small molecules with the anions and cations on the surface of the PNCs, they can provide strong surface protection against PNC fusion during centrifugal purification process and repair the surface defects of PNCs, so that the original uniform size distribution of PNCs can be maintained and FRET between close&#8208;packed PNC films is effectively suppressed, which allows the emission characteristics of the films to be preserved. As a result, highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free high&#8208;quality PNC thin films are obtained, with PLQY as high as 95.1%, far exceeding that of the original film, and corresponding LEDs exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Electrochemical Sensors Facilitate the Study of DNA Binding by Platinum (II)&#8208;based Antineoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA crosslinking agents such as cisplatin and related platinum(II) analogs are effective drugs to treat solid tumors. However, these therapeutics can cause high toxicity in the body, and tumors can develop resistance to them. To develop less toxic and more effective DNA crosslinkers, medicinal chemists have focused on tuning the ligands in square planar platinum(II) complexes to modulate their bioavailability, targeted cell penetration, and DNA binding rates. Unfortunately, linking in&#8208;vitro DNA binding capacity of DNA crosslinkers with their in&#8208;vivo efficacy has proven challenging. Here we report an electrochemical biosensor strategy that allows the study of platinum(II)&#8208;DNA binding in real time. Our biosensors contain a purine&#8208;rich deoxynucleotide sequence, T6(AG)10, modified with a 5&#8217; hexylthiol linker for easy self&#8208;assembly onto gold electrodes. The 3&#8217; terminus is functionalized with the redox reporter methylene blue. Electron transfer from methylene blue to the sensor is a function of platinum(II) compound concentration and reaction time. Using these biosensors, we resolve DNA binding mechanisms including monovalent and bivalent binding, as well as base stacking. Our approach can measure DNA binding kinetics in buffers and in 50% serum, offering a single&#8208;step, real&#8208;time approach to screen therapeutic compounds during drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structural Role of N170 in Substrate&#8208;Assisted Deacylation in KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;Lactamase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino acid substitutions in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) that have arisen in the clinic are observed to lead to the development of resistance to ceftazidime&#8208;avibactam, a preferred treatment for KPC bearing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) results in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, leading to alterations in substrate specificity, decreased stability, and more recently observed, increased resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam. Using accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations, we explored in detail the structural role of R164 and D179 variants that are described to confer ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The buried conformation of D179 substitutions produce a pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop &#8208; more than R164 mutants, where the crystallographic omega loop structure remains mostly intact. Our findings also reveal that the conformation of N170 plays an underappreciated role impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation. The results further support the hypothesis that KPC&#8208;2 D179 variants employ substrate&#8208;assisted catalysis for ceftazidime hydrolysis, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover. Moreover, the shift in the WT conformation of N170 contributes to reduced deacylation and altered spectrum of enzymatic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithiophilic Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Coating for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth of disorganized lithium dendrites and weak solid electrolyte interphase greatly impede the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new kind of stable polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have a high density of well&#8208;aligned lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units anchored within the uniform one&#8208;dimensional channels. The COFs can serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, effectively guiding the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. The unsymmetrical Li||COF&#8208;Cu battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99% at a current density of 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, which can be well retained up to 400 cycles. Meanwhile, the Li&#8208;COF||LFP full cell shows a Coulombic efficiency over 99% at a charge of 0.3 C. And its capacity can be well maintained up to 91% even after 150 cycles. Therefore, the significant electrochemical cycling stability illustrates the feasibility of employing COFs in solving the disordered deposition of lithium ions in lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Cation Salts of Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls: Polar Crystals, Negative Thermal Expansion and Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical cation salts of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles are rich in physical properties. Herein, two kinds of hetera&#8208;buckybowls, ethoxy substituted trithiasumanene (3SEt) and triselenasumanene (3SeEt), are synthesized as electron donors. Galvanostatic oxidation of them affords radical cation salts (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SeEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SEt)4PMA and (3SeEt)4PMA, where PMA is Keggin type phosphomolybdate and TTFMPB is tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenyl]borate. In these salts, 3SEt/3SeEt are partially charged and show distinct conformation change with the site charge and counter anions. In TTFMPB salts, (TTFMPB)&#8211; form hexagonal channels that accommodate the packing columns of 3SEt/3SeEt. Particlularly, (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3 adopts R3c space group to be polar crystal and the columns of 3SEt are all in the up&#8208;bowl direction. The PMA salts of 3SEt/3SeEt are polar crystals (C2 space group) with 3SEt/3SeEt being planar and forming columnar stacks. (3SeEt)4PMA shows a structural modulation below 200 K, i.e., negative thermal expansion (NTE) of unit cell volume and enlargement of intermolecular distances between neighboring 3SeEt molecules. The four salts are semiconductors with activation energy of 0.18&#8211;0.38 eV. The conductivity of (3SeEt)4PMA shows a reversible transition upon cooling and heating, in accordance to the NTE structural modulation. This work paves a way toward conducting materials based on hetera&#8208;buckybowls.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Ferricyanide/Ferrocyanide Redox Mediated Recycling Spent LiFePO4 with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable alternative oxidation reactions offers a promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost&#8208;effective, environment&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; is low at 0.87 V. Operando Raman and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;, thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH&#183;H2O and FePO4. The electrolyzer consumes 3.6 kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 43% less than conventional water electrolysis. Additionally, this recycling pathway for spent LFP batteries not only minimizes chemical consumption and prevents secondary pollution but also presents significant economic benefits.</dc:description>

         <title>Stress Dissipation Driven by Multi&#8208;Interface Built&#8208;In Electric Fields and Desert&#8208;Rose&#8208;Like Structure for Ultrafast and Superior Long&#8208;Term Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetics and durability of conversion&#8208;based anodes greatly depend on the intrinsic stress regulating ability of the electrode materials, which has been significantly neglected. Herein, a stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface built&#8208;in electric fields (BEFs) and architected structure, is innovatively proposed to design ultrafast and long&#8208;term sodium ion storage anodes. Binary Mo/Fe sulfide heterostructured nanorods with multi&#8208;interface BEFs and staggered cantilever configuration are fabricated to prove our concept. Multi&#8208;physics simulations and experimental results confirm that the inner stress in multiple directions can be dissipated by the multi&#8208;interface BEFs at the micro&#8208;scale, and by the staggered cantilever structure at the macro&#8208;scale, respectively. As a result, our designed heterostructured nanorods anode exhibits superb rate capability (332.8 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and durable cyclic stability over 900 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1, outperforming other metal chalcogenides. This proposed stress dissipation strategy offers a new insight for developing stable structures for conversion&#8208;based anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Rate Performance of Encapsulating Lithium&#8208;Polysulfide Electrolytes for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycle life of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is severely plagued by the incessant parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and reactive lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating lithium&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE) emerges as an effective electrolyte design to mitigate the parasitic reactions kinetically. Nevertheless, the rate performance of Li&#8211;S batteries with EPSE is synchronously suppressed. Herein, the sacrifice in rate performance by EPSE is circumvented while mitigating parasitic reactions by employing hexyl methyl ether (HME) as a co&#8208;solvent. The specific capacity of Li&#8211;S batteries with HME&#8208;based EPSE is nearly not decreased at 0.1 C compared with conventional ether electrolytes. With an ultrathin Li metal anode (50 &#181;m) and a high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4 mg cm&#8722;2), a longer cycle life of 113 cycles was achieved in HME&#8208;based EPSE compared with that of 65 cycles in conventional ether electrolytes at 0.1 C. Furthermore, both high energy density of 387 Wh kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27 cycles were achieved in a Li&#8210;S pouch cell (2.7 Ah). This work inspires the feasibility of regulating the solvation structure of LiPSs in EPSE for Li&#8211;S batteries with balanced performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Homeostasis Systems Based on Feedback Reaction Networks: Design Principles and Future Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Feedback&#8208;controlled chemical reaction networks (FCRNs) are indispensable for various biological processes, such as cellular mechanisms, patterns, and signaling pathways. Through the intricate interplay of many feedback loops (FLs), FCRNs maintain a stable internal cellular environment. Currently, creating minimalistic synthetic cells is the long&#8208;term objective of systems chemistry, which is motivated by such natural integrity. The design, kinetic optimization, and analysis of FCRNs to exhibit functions akin to those of a cell still pose significant challenges. Indeed, reaching synthetic homeostasis is essential for engineering synthetic cell components. However, maintaining homeostasis in artificial systems against various agitations is a difficult task. Several biological events can provide us with guidelines for a conceptual understanding of homeostasis, which can be further applicable in designing artificial synthetic systems. In this regard, we organize our review with artificial homeostasis systems driven by FCRNs at different length scales, including homogenous, compartmentalized, and soft material systems. First, we stretch a quick overview of FCRNs in different molecular and supramolecular systems, which are the essential toolbox for engineering different nonlinear functions and homeostatic systems. Moreover, the existing history of synthetic homeostasis in chemical and material systems and their advanced functions with self&#8208;correcting, and regulating properties are also emphasized.</dc:description>

Currently, creating minimalistic synthetic cells is the long-term objective of systems chemistry, which is motivated by such natural integrity. The design, kinetic optimization, and analysis of FCRNs to exhibit functions akin to those of a cell still pose significant challenges. Indeed, reaching synthetic homeostasis is essential for engineering synthetic cell components. However, maintaining homeostasis in artificial systems against various agitations is a difficult task. Several biological events can provide us with guidelines for a conceptual understanding of homeostasis, which can be further applicable in designing artificial synthetic systems. In this regard, we organize our review with artificial homeostasis systems driven by FCRNs at different length scales, including homogenous, compartmentalized, and soft material systems. First, we stretch a quick overview of FCRNs in different molecular and supramolecular systems, which are the essential toolbox for engineering different nonlinear functions and homeostatic systems. Moreover, the existing history of synthetic homeostasis in chemical and material systems and their advanced functions with self-correcting, and regulating properties are also emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Aminotetralins via [4+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for efficient and selective methods for the divergent synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted aminotetralins is of much interest and importance. We report herein for the first time the diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of 2&#8208;methyl aromatic&#160;aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts, which constitutes an efficient route for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily accessible aldimines and alkenes. The use of a scandium catalyst bearing a sterically demanding cyclopentadienyl ligand such as C5Me4SiMe3 or C5Me5&#160;exclusively afforded the trans&#8208;selective annulation products in the reaction of aldimines with styrenes and aliphatic alkenes. In contrast, the analogous yttrium catalyst, whose metal ion size is larger than that of scandium, yielded the cis&#8208;selective annulation products. This protocol features 100% atom&#8208;efficiency, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. The reaction mechanisms have been elucidated by kinetic isotope e&#64256;ect (KIE) experiments and the isolation and transformations of some key reaction intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, it permits the stability of the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in mitochondrion respiratory chain, small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in lipid bilayer, facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and proton. These facilitate enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This present work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar X&#8211;H Bond (X = O, S, N) Activation at a Cage Silanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent silicon compounds such as neutral silylenes display versatile reactivity for the activation of small molecules. In contrast, their anionic congeners silanides ([R3Si&#8211;]) have primarily been investigated for their nucleophilic reactivity. Here we show that incorporating a silanide center in a bicyclic cage structure allows for formal oxidative addition of polar element&#8208;hydrogen bonds (RX&#8211;H, R = aromatic residue, X = O, S, NH). The resulting hydrosilicates were isolated and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations support an ionic mechanism for RX&#8211;H bond activation. Finally, the reactivity of the RS&#8211;H bond adduct was further investigated, revealing that it behaves as a Lewis pair upon facile heterolytic cleavage of the Si&#8211;S bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Oligomerization of Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 in the Cell Membrane using Photo&#8208;Activated Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial rhodopsins are retinal membrane proteins that found a broad application in optogenetics. The oligomeric state of rhodopsins is important for their functionality and stability. Of particular interest is the oligomeric state in the cellular native membrane environment. Fluorescence microscopy provides powerful tools to determine the oligomeric state of membrane proteins directly in cells. Among these methods is quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (qPALM) allowing the investigation of molecular organization at the level of single protein clusters. Here, we apply qPALM to investigate the oligomeric state of the first and most used optogenetic tool Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. ChR2 appeared predominantly as a dimer in the cell membrane and did not form higher oligomers. The disulfide bonds between Cys34 and Cys36 of adjacent ChR2 monomers were not required for dimer formation and mutations disrupting these bonds resulted in only partial monomerization of ChR2. The monomeric fraction increased when the total concentration of mutant ChR2 in the membrane was low. The dissociation constant was estimated for this partially monomerized mutant ChR2 as 2.2&#177;0.9 proteins/&#956;m2. Our findings are important for understanding the mechanistic basis of ChR2 activity as well as for improving existing and developing future optogenetic tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Guangnanmycin A Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Guangnanmycin A is a recently discovered congener of the well&#8208;known antitumor drug lead leinamycin; its macrolactam ring, however, is even more strained than that of the parent compound. The first synthetic foray towards this challenging target is reported, which relies on a molybdenum catalyzed macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) followed by a ruthenium catalyzed redox isomerization of the propargyl alcohol thus formed; the resulting enone served the introduction of the yet missing exo&#8208;methylene group by a modified Peterson olefination well. The signature disulfide moiety of guangnanmycin A was installed by a strain&#8208;driven thia&#8208;Michael addition followed by conversion of the thioether thus formed into an unsymmetric disulfide with the aid of (methylthio)dimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate and MeSSMe. While this sequence furnished racemic guangnanmycin A alcohol in good overall yield, the final oxidation to the corresponding acid failed likely because of the exceptional sensitivity caused by the strained scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalysis: Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol&#8208;to&#8208;Aldehyde Oxidation without Sacrifical Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a growing interest in developing
dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) to produce molecular hydrogen (H2) as alternative energy source. To improve the sustainability of this technology, we replaced the sacrificial electron donor (SED), typically an expensive and polluting chemical, with an alcohol oxidation catalyst. This study demonstrates the first
