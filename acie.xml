         <title>Temporal&#8208;Focusing Multiphoton Excitation Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy Using Spontaneously Blinking Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) based on temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation (TFMPE) and single&#8208;wavelength excitation is used to visualize the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distribution of spontaneously blinking fluorophore&#8208;labeled subcellular structures in a thick specimen with a nanoscale&#8208;level spatial resolution. To eliminate the photobleaching effect of unlocalized molecules in out&#8208;of&#8208;focus regions for improving the utilization rate of the photon budget in 3D SMLM imaging, SMLM with single&#8208;wavelength TFMPE achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation (TPE) of spontaneously blinking fluorophores. TPE spectral measurement of blinking fluorophores is then conducted through TFMPE imaging at a tunable excitation wavelength, yielding the optimal TPE wavelength for increasing the number of detected photons from a single blinking event during SMLM. Subsequently, the TPE fluorescence of blinking fluorophores is recorded to obtain a two&#8208;dimensional TFMPE&#8208;SMLM image of the microtubules in cancer cells with a localization precision of 18 &#177; 6 nm and an overall imaging resolution of approximately 51 nm, which is estimated based on the contribution of Nyquist resolution and localization precision. Combined with astigmatic imaging, the system is capable of 3D TFMPE&#8208;SMLM imaging of brain tissue section of a 5XFAD transgenic mouse with the pathological features of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, revealing the distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;beta peptide deposits.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inspired by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds proven to be the promising dynamic linkage for the construction of crystalline covalent organic polymers/frameworks (COPs/COFs), we employed 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) benzene (BACT) and N,N'&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (DPNTCDI) as the corresponding building blocks to construct a functional COP (named as CityU&#8208;25), which had been employed as an anode in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. CityU&#8208;25 displayed an excellent reversible lithium storage capability of 455 mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.1 A/g, and an impressive one of 673 mAh/g after 720 cycles at 0.5 A/g.

         <title>Controlled Biocatalytic Synthesis of a Metal Nanoparticle&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid: Demonstration for Catalytic H2&#8208;driven NADH Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we demonstrate the preparation of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrids of NAD+ reductase with biocatalytically&#8208;synthesised small gold nanoparticles (NPs, &lt;10 nm) and core&#8208;shell gold&#8208;platinum NPs for tandem catalysis. Despite the variety of methods available for NP synthesis, there remains a need for more sustainable strategies which also give precise control over the shape and size of the metal NPs for applications in catalysis, biomedical devices, and electronics. We demonstrate facile biosynthesis of spherical, highly uniform, gold NPs under mild conditions using an isolated enzyme moiety, an NAD+ reductase, to reduce metal salts while oxidising a nicotinamide&#8208;containing cofactor. By subsequently introducing platinum salts, we show that core&#8208;shell Au@Pt NPs can then be formed. Catalytic function of these enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids was demonstrated for H2&#8208;driven NADH recycling to support enantioselective ketone reduction by an NADH&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Control of Fluorescence Lifetime towards Multiplexing Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence lifetime imaging has been a powerful tool for biomedical research. Recently, fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based multiplexing imaging has expanded imaging channels by using probes that harbor the same spectral channels and distinct excited state lifetime. While it is desirable to control the excited state lifetime of any given fluorescent probes, the rational control of fluorescence lifetimes remains a challenge. Herein, we chose boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as a model system and provided chemical strategies to regulate the fluorescence lifetime of its derivatives with varying spectral features. We find electronegativity of structural substituents at the 8&#8217; and 5&#8217; positions are important to control the lifetime for the green&#8208;emitting and red&#8208;emitting BODIPY scaffolds. Mechanistically, such influences are exerted via the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer and the intramolecular charge transfer processes for the 8&#8217; and 5&#8217; positions of BODIPY, respectively. Based on these principles, we have generated a group of BODIPY probes that enable imaging experiments to separate multiple targets using fluorescence lifetime as a signal. In addition to BODIPY, we envision modulation of electronegativity of chemical substituents could serve as a feasible strategy to achieve rational control of fluorescence lifetime for a variety of small molecule fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8211;Cation Competition Chemistry for Comprehensive High&#8208;Performance Prussian Blue Analogs Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After high&#8208;voltage CV scanning, the higher (de)intercalation voltage and lower diffusion activation energy for both Cl&#8722; and K+ boost the comprehensive improvement of the discharge voltage, capacity, rate and cyclic performance. The comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs.







Abstract
The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry (Cl&#8722;, K+, Zn2+) stimulated by high&#8208;voltage scanning. With our designed anion&#8208;cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &gt;2.0&#8197;V (vs. Zn/Zn2+), capacity &gt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96&#8201;% from 0.6 to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000&#8197;cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance PBAs cathode batteries.

With our designed anion-cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &amp;gt;2.0&#8197;V (vs. Zn/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), capacity &amp;gt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96&#8201;% from 0.6 to 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000&#8197;cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion-cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next-generation high-performance PBAs cathode batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Dissipative Control of Multimodal Motion in a Silver(I) Catenate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not one, not two, not three, but four! Filling four receptor sites with Ag+ as chemical fuel is the key to the transient and successive self&#8208;assembly of two multicomponent devices. While the first device displays two nanomechanical movements (shuttling and sliding), the second exhibits a sliding motion at increased speed.







Abstract
Stepwise dissipative control of two distinct motions, i.e., shuttling and sliding, is demonstrated in a single multicomponent device. When [2]rotaxane 1, which acts as a biped, and deck 2 were treated with AgBF4/PhCH2Br+NEt3 as chemical fuel, the transient catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ was instantly generated showing multimodal motion and autonomous return to 1 and 2. In the dissipative process, catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ cleanly transformed into the follow&#8208;up transient device (1)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ exhibiting only sliding motion. Two interference&#8208;free dissipative cycles proved the resilience and robustness of the process.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Promoted Activation of N2O, Amine, and H2 as well as Catalytic Hydrogenation of Imines, Quinoline, and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a series of dearomatized calcium pincer complexes. They exhibit high activity toward N2O, secondary amines, and D2(H2), leading to the facile synthesis of calcium diazotate complexes and heterolytic cleavage of N&#8722;H and D&#8722;D(H&#8722;H) bonds by a metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) manner. In addition, hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules was realized, catalyzed by dearomatized calcium pincer complexes.







Abstract
Bond activation and catalysis using s&#8208;block metals are of great significance. Herein, a series of calcium pincer complexes with deprotonated side arms have been prepared using pyridine&#8208;based PNP and PNN ligands. The complexes were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystal diffraction. Utilizing the obtained calcium complexes, unprecedented N2O activation by metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) involving dearomatization&#8208;aromatization of the pyridine ligand was achieved, generating aromatized calcium diazotate complexes as products. Additionally, the dearomatized calcium complexes were able to activate the N&#8722;H bond as well as reversibly activate H2, offering an opportunity for the catalytic hydrogenation of various unsaturated molecules. DFT calculations were applied to analyze the electronic structures of the synthesized complexes and explore possible reaction mechanisms. This study is an important complement to the area of MLC and main&#8208;group metal chemistry.

         <title>Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of protein templates in artificial enzyme design is illustrated through genetic code expansion. Incorporation of a secondary amine into the nucleotide&#8208;binding DHFR and multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR resulted in catalytic entities, with the former favoring the use of NADPH as the hydride source for reactions, whereas the latter required biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH).







Abstract
Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N&#8208;terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. In this study, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR and nucleotide&#8208;binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D&#8208;proline moiety demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro&#8208;R hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r. up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis. Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR&#8208;based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.

         <title>Fluorinated Polyimide Tunneling Layer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide was employed as the interface layer between perovskite and hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells. This insulating interface layer facilitates carrier transport via the tunneling effect while effectively passivating defects and providing field&#8208;effect passivation. The optimized devices attained a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.61&#8201;% and demonstrated excellent stability.







Abstract
Despite the remarkable progress of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), challenges remain in terms of finding effective and viable strategies to enhance their long&#8208;term stability while maintaining high efficiency. In this study, a new insulating and hydrophobic fluorinated polyimide (FPI: 6FDA&#8208;6FAPB) was used as the interface layer between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) in PSCs. The functional groups of FPI play a pivotal role in passivating interface defects within the device. Due to its high work function, FPI demonstrates field&#8208;effect passivation (FEP) capabilities as an interface layer, effectively mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface. Notably, the FPI insulating interface layer does not impede carrier transmission at the interface, which is attributed to the presence of hole tunneling effects. The optimized PSCs achieve an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.61&#8201;% and demonstrate excellent stability, showcasing the efficacy of FPI in enhancing device performance and reliability.

         <title>Aqueous Coordination&#8208;Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water, a poison in traditional olefin polymerization processes using Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, enables coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa) using single&#8208;component and neutral nickel catalysts under mild conditions.







Abstract
Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co&#8208;)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long&#8208;sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers.

     alt="Aqueous Coordination-Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water, a poison in traditional olefin polymerization processes using Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalysts, enables coordination-insertion copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high-molecular-weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa) using single-component and neutral nickel catalysts under mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co-)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long-sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination-insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low-molecular-weight polymers. Herein, we develop well-behaved neutral phosphinophenolato nickel catalysts, which enable aqueous copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high-molecular-weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549&#8197;kDa, 0.13&#8211;1.29&#8197;mol&#8201;%) in a single-component fashion under mild conditions for the first time. These copolymerization reactions occur better in water than in hydrocarbons such as toluene. The dual characteristics of high molecular weight and the incorporation of a small amount of functional group result in improved surface properties while retain the desirable intrinsic properties of high-density polyethylene (HDPE).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stiffness Modulation and Pulsatile Release in Dual Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hydrogels that similar to living organisms can maintain or adapt their properties and internal structure upon exposure to a combination of external stimuli. These hydrogels contain both redox and light responsive units, which can operate independently if addressed separately, but show adaptivity and self&#8208;regulation of stiffness when addressed simultaneously.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, self&#8208;regulation can be introduced in synthetic hydrogels by incorporating chemo&#8208;mechanical signals or coupled chemical reactions to maintain or adapt the material's physico&#8208;chemical properties when exposed to external triggers. In this work, we present redox and light dual stimuli responsive hydrogels capable of rapidly adapting the polymer crosslinking network while maintaining hydrogel stability. Upon irradiation with UV light, polymer hydrogels containing redox responsive disulfide crosslinks and light responsive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties show a release of payload accompanied by adaptation of the hydrogel network towards higher stiffness due to in situ crosslinking by S&#8208;nitrosylation. Whereas the hydrogel design allows the network to either become softer in presence of reducing agent glutathione or stiffer upon UV irradiation, simultaneous application of both stimuli induces network self&#8208;regulation resulting in a pulsatile form of payload release from the hydrogel. Finally, adaptive stiffness was used to make tunable hydrogels as substrates for different cell lines.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Spontaneous Electropolymerization Enables Robust Hydrogel Electrolyte Interfaces in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ electropolymerization strategy is introduced to form robust hydrogel electrolyte interfaces in aqueous batteries. This approach effectively enhances the interface stability between electrodes and hydrogel, concurrently stabilizing zinc metal anodes and facilitating the charge transfer on the rough cathode.







Abstract
Hydrogels hold great promise as electrolytes for emerging aqueous batteries, for which establishing a robust electrode&#8208;hydrogel interface is crucial for mitigating side reactions. Conventional hydrogel electrolytes fabricated by ex situ polymerization through either thermal stimulation or photo exposure cannot ensure complete interfacial contact with electrodes. Herein, we introduce an in situ electropolymerization approach for constructing hydrogel electrolytes. The hydrogel is spontaneously generated during the initial cycling of the battery, eliminating the need of additional initiators for polymerization. The involvement of electrodes during the hydrogel synthesis yields well&#8208;bonded and deep infiltrated electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. As a case study, we attest that, the in situ&#8208;formed polyanionic hydrogel in Zn&#8208;MnO2 battery substantially improves the stability and kinetics of both Zn anode and porous MnO2 cathode owing to the robust interfaces. This research provides insight to the function of hydrogel electrolyte interfaces and constitutes a critical advancement in designing highly durable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Immobilization of Amino&#8208;site into a Pore&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Separation of Propyne/Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2 with densely decorated amino sites and partitioned nanosapces is capable of efficiently producing polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from C3H4&#8208;containing mixtures.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) is a crucial yet complex process, however, it remains a great difficulty in developing porous materials that can meet the requirements for practical applications, particularly with an exceptional ability to bind and store trace amounts of C3H4. Functionalization of pore&#8208;partitioned metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis&#8208;basic (&#8722;NH2) and Lewis&#8208;acidic (&#8722;NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1&#8197;kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4&#8722;C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2&#8208;decorated ppMOF (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2) can efficiently produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 (99.95&#8201;%, 8.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2&#8208;decorated crystal (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NO2). The in situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.

         <title>Distinguish MnO2/Mn2+ Conversion/ Zn2+ Intercalation/ H+ Conversion Chemistries at Different Potentials in Aqueous Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte with an extended electrochemical stability window of approximately 3.0&#8197;V in a water&#8208;rich environment (76&#8197;wt&#8201;%). This widened window enables high&#8208;voltage scanning to initiate the MnO2/Mn2+ redox conversion at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. By employing specific surfactant (e.g., hexadecyl pyridinium chloride monohydrate), the electrolyte potentially segregates Zn2+ and H+ intercalation processes. The tailored amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte facilitates the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V, exclusive Zn2+ intercalation at an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau of approximately 1.33&#8197;V, and H+ intercalation/conversion at plateaus near 1.12&#8197;V.







Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 chemistry has been extensively explored, but its electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in the context of MnO2/Mn2+ conversion and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, remain not fully understood. Here, we designed an amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte, which distinguished the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion, Zn2+ intercalation, and H+ intercalation and conversion processes at three distinct discharge plateaus of an aqueous Zn||MnO2 battery. The amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte is featured with an extended electrochemical stability window up to 3.0&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity, Zn2+&#8208;selective ion tunnels, and hydrophobic associations with cathode materials. This specifically designed electrolyte allows the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. More interesting, the discharge plateaus of ~1.33&#8197;V, previously assigned as the co&#8208;intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ ions in the MnO2 cathode, are specified as the exclusive intercalation of Zn2+ ions, leading to an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau. Furthermore, with a distinct three&#8208;step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high specific energy of 0.858&#8197;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even at a low MnO2 loading mass of 0.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries.

Furthermore, with a distinct three-step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high specific energy of 0.858&#8197;Wh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, even at a low MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loading mass of 0.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cyclometallated Imides as Templates for the H&#8208;Bond Directed Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of N&#8208;Methyl, N&#8208;Alkyl and N&#8208;Aryl Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined computational and experimental approach allowed us to develop the most selective catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl and N&#8208;alkyl imines described to date. Iridium catalysts with a cyclometallated cyclic imide group provide selectivity of up to 99% enantiomeric excess. Computational studies show that the selectivity results from the combined effect of H&#8208;bonding of the imide C=O with the substrate iminium ion and a stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction with the cyclometallated ligand. The cyclometallated ligand thus exhibits a unique mode of action, serving as a template for the H&#8208;bond directed approach of the substrate which results in enhanced selectivity. The catalyst (2) has been synthesized and isolated as a crystalline air&#8208;stable solid. X&#8208;ray analysis of 2 confirmed the structure of the catalyst and the correct position of the imide C=O groups to engage in an H&#8208;bond with the substrate. 19F&#8208;NMR real&#8208;time monitoring showed the hydrogenation of N&#8208;methyl imines catalyzed by 2 is very fast, with a TOF of approx. 3500 h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Shows Anomalous Entropic Effect on Catalysis via Surface Pre&#8208;melting of Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the superior catalytic activity and efficient utilization of noble metals, nanocatalysts are extensively used in the modern industrial production of chemicals. The surface structures of these materials are significantly influenced by reactive adsorbates, leading to dynamic behavior under experimental conditions. The dynamic nature poses significant challenges in studying the &#160;structure&#8208;activity relations of catalysts. Herein, we unveil an anomalous entropic effect on catalysis via surface pre&#8208;melting of nanoclusters through machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics and free energy calculation. We find that due to the pre&#8208;melting of shell atoms, there exists a non&#8208;linear variation in the catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with temperature. Consequently, two notable changes in catalyst activity occur at the respective temperatures of melting for the shell and core atoms. We further study the nanoclusters with surface point defects, i.e. vacancy and ad&#8208;atom, and observe significant decrease in the surface melting temperatures of the nanoclusters, enabling the reaction to take place under more favorable and milder conditions. These findings not only provide novel insights into dynamic catalysis of nanoclusters &#160;but also offer new understanding of the role of point defects in catalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric Afterglow Luminescent Imaging of Matrix Metalloproteinase&#8208;2 Activity via an Energy Diversion Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ratiometric afterglow luminescent (AGL) probes are attractive for in vivo imaging due to their high sensitivity and signal self&#8208;calibration function. However, there are currently few ratiometric AGL probes available for imaging enzymatic activity in living organisms. Here, we present an energy diversion (ED) strategy that enables the design of an enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric AGL probe (RAG&#8208;RGD) for in vivo afterglow imaging. The ED process provides RAG&#8208;RGD with a radiative transition for an &#8216;always on&#8217; 520&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL520) and a cascade three&#8208;step energy transfer (ET) process for an &#8216;off&#8208;on&#8217; 710&#8208;nm AGL signal (AGL710) in response to a specific enzyme. Using matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) as an example, RAG&#8208;RGD shows a significant ~11&#8208;fold increase in AGL710/AGL520 toward MMP&#8208;2. This can sensitively detect U87MG brain tumors through ratiometric afterglow imaging of MMP&#8208;2 activity, with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep imaging depth. Furthermore, by utilizing the self&#8208;calibration effect of ratiometric imaging, RAG&#8208;RGD demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the AGL710/AGL520 value and the size of orthotopic U87MG tumor, enabling accurate monitoring of orthotopic glioma growth in vivo. This ED process may be applied for the design of other enzyme&#8208;activated ratiometric afterglow probes for sensitive afterglow imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Delocalizing Excitation for Highly&#8208;Active Organic Photovoltaic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized excitation in traditional organic photocatalysts typically prevents the generation and extraction of photo&#8208;induced free charge carriers, limiting their activity enhancement under illumination.  Here, we enhance delocalized photoexcitation of small molecular photovoltaic catalysts by weakening their electron&#8208;phonon coupling via rational fluoro&#8208;substitution. The optimized 2FBP&#8208;4F catalyst we develop here exhibits a minimized Huang&#8211;Rhys factor of 0.35 in solution, high dielectric constant and strong crystallization in the solid state. As a result, the energy barrier for exciton dissociation is decreased, and more importantly, polarons are unusually observed in 2FBP&#8208;4F nanoparticles (NPs). With the increased hole transfer efficiency and prolonged carrier lifetime highly related to enhanced exciton delocalization, the PM6:2FBP&#8208;4F heterojunction NPs at varied concentration exhibit much higher optimized photocatalytic activity (207.6~561.8 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) for hydrogen evolution than the control PM6:BP&#8208;4F and PM6:2FBP&#8208;6F NPs, as well as other reported photocatalysts under simulated solar light (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclopropenes as Chemical Reporters for Dual Bioorthogonal and Orthogonal Metabolic Labeling of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual biorthogonal and orthogonal metabolic labeling of genomic DNA in HeLa cells was demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl&#8208;tetrazine dye conjugate and the photoclick reaction with a pyrene&#8208;tetrazole using isomeric cyclopropenes as chemical reporters.







Abstract
Dual bioorthogonal labeling enables the investigation and understanding of interactions in the biological environment that are not accessible by a single label. However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross&#8208;reactivity. We developed a pair of differently modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcyclopropenyl&#8208;modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest&#8208;reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions. Their orthogonal reactivity could be evidenced in vitro. Primer extension experiments were performed with both 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines investigating their replication properties as substitutes for thymidine and evaluating subsequent labeling reactions on the DNA level. Finally, dual, orthogonal and metabolic fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA was demonstrated in HeLa cells. An experimental procedure was developed combining intracellular transport and metabolic DNA incorporation of the two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines with the subsequent dual bioorthogonal labeling using a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl tetrazine and a fluorogenic pyrene&#8208;tetrazole. These results are fundamental for advanced metabolic labeling strategies for nucleic acids in the future, especially for live cell experiments.

However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross-reactivity. We developed a pair of differently modified 2&#8242;-deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse-electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1- and 3-methylcyclopropenyl-modified 2&#8242;-deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8242;-deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest-reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions.

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Mediated Electronic&#8208;State Manipulation of&#160;Conjugated Organic Polymers Enabling Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers with tailorable composition and microarchitecture are propitious for modulating catalytic properties and deciphering inherent structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we report a facile linker engineering strategy to manipulate the electronic states of metallophthalocyanine conjugated polymers and uncover the vital role of organic linkers in facilitating electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Specifically, a set of cobalt phthalocyanine conjugated polymers (CoPc&#8208;CPs) wrapped onto carbon nanotubes (denoted CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs) are judiciously crafted via in situ assembling square&#8208;planar cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine (CoPc(NH2)4) with different linear aromatic dialdehyde&#8208;based organic linkers in the presence of CNTs. Intriguingly, upon varying the electronic characteristic of organic linkers from terephthalaldehyde (TA) to 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxaldehyde (TDA) and then to thieno/thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxaldehyde (bTDA), their corresponding CNTs@CoPc&#8208;CPs exhibit gradually improved electrocatalytic ORR performance. More importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer from CoPc units to electron&#8208;withdrawing linkers (i.e., TDA and bTDA) drives the delocalization of Co d&#8208;orbital electrons, thereby downshifting the Co d&#8208;band energy level. Accordingly, the active Co centers with more positive valence state exhibit optimized binding energy toward ORR&#8208;relevant intermediates and thus a balanced adsorption/desorption pathway that endows significant enhancement in electrocatalytic ORR. This work demonstrates a molecular&#8208;level engineering route for rationally designing efficient polymer catalysts and gaining insightful understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin &#8216;Chaperones&#8217; Enable Quasi&#8208;Ideal Supramolecular Network Formation and Enhanced Photodimerization of Hydrophobic, Red&#8208;shifted Photoswitches in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precision&#8208;engineered light&#8208;triggered hydrogels are important for a diversity of applications. However, fields such as biomaterials require wavelength outside the harsh UV regime to prevent photodamage, typically requiring chromophores with extended p&#8208;conjugation that suffer from poor water solubility. Herein, we demonstrate how cyclodextrins can be used as auxiliary agents to not only solubilize such chromophores, but even to preorganize them in a 2:2 host&#8208;guest inclusion complex to facilitate photodimerization. We apply our concept to styrylpyrene&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols (sPEGs). We initially unravel details of the host&#8208;guest inclusion complex using spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to give clear evidence of a 2:2 complex formation. Subsequently, we show that the resultant supramolecularly linked hydrogels conform to theories of supramolecular quasi&#8208;ideal model networks, and derive details on their association dynamics using in&#8208;depth rheological measurements and kinetic models. By comparing sPEGs of different arm length, we further elucidate the model network topology and the accessible mechanical property space. The photo&#8208;mediated dimerization proceeds smoothly, allowing to transform the supramolecular model networks into covalent ones. We believe that our strategy opens new avenues for executing hydrophobic photochemistry in aqueous environments with enhanced control over reactivity, hydrogel topology or programmable mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Sensor Based on Steric Hindrance Regulated Molecular Packing for In Vivo Epilepsy Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence sensing is crucial to study biological processes and diagnose diseases, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window with reduces background signals. However, it's still a great challenge to construct "off&#8208;on" sensors when the sensing wavelength extends into the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region to obtain higher imaging contrast, mainly due to the difficult synthesis of spectral overlapped quencher. Here, we present a new fluorescence quenching strategy, which utilizes steric hindrance quenchers (SHQ) to tune the molecular packing state of fluorophores and suppress the emission signal. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that large SHQ can competitively packing with fluorophores and prevent their self&#8208;aggregation. Based on this quenching mechanism, a novel activatable "off&#8208;on" sensing method is achieved via bio&#8208;analyte responsive invalidation of SHQ, namely Steric Hindrance Invalidation geNerated Emission (SHINE) strategy.&#160;As a proof of concept, the ClO&#8208; sensitive SHQ lead to the bright NIR&#8208;II signal release in epileptic mouse hippocampus under the skull and high photon scattering brain tissue, providing the real&#8208;time visualization of ClO&#8208; generation process in living epileptic mice.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient and chemoselective approach for the divergent assembling of unsymmetrical hydrazines through an unprecedented intermolecular desulfurdioxidative N&#8208;N coupling is developed. This metal free protocol employs readily accessible N&#8208;arylhydroxylamines and N&#8208;sulfinylanilines to provide highly valuable hydrazine products with good yields and excellent functional group tolerance under simple conditions. Computational studies suggest that the in situ generated O&#8208;sulfenylated arylhydroxylamine intermediate undergoes a retro&#8208;[2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition via a stepwise diradical mechanism to form the N&#8208;N bond and release SO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A MOF@Metal Oxide Heterostructure Induced by Post&#8208;Synthetic Gamma&#8208;Ray Irradiation for Catalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based heterostructures, which exhibit enhanced or unexpected functionality and properties due to synergistic effects, are typically synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. However, several reported post&#8208;synthetic strategies remain unsatisfactory, considering issues such as damage to the crystallinity of MOFs, presence of impure phases, and high time and energy consumption. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a novel route for constructing MOF based heterostructures using radiation&#8208;induced post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting the merits of convenience, ambient conditions, large&#8208;scale production, and notable time and energy saving. Specifically, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was successfully synthesized by simply irradiating a methanol solution dispersed of HKUST&#8208;1 with gamma ray under ambient conditions. The Copper source of Cu2O was directly derived from in situ radiation etching and reduction of the parent HKUST&#8208;1, without the use of any additional copper reagents. Significantly, the resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, with a catalytic rate constant nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent HKUST&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Component Cationic Lipids for Systemic mRNA Delivery to Splenic T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four&#8208;component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non&#8208;liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one&#8208;component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine&#8208;based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Unlocking the full potential of mRNA immunotherapy necessitates targeted delivery to specific cell subsets in the spleen. Four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) utilized in numerous clinical trials are primarily limited in hepatocyte and muscular targeting, highlighting the imperative demand for targeted and simplified non-liver mRNA delivery systems. Herein, we report the rational design of one-component ionizable cationic lipids to selectively deliver mRNA to the spleen and T cells with high efficacy. Unlike the tertiary amine-based ionizable lipids involved in LNPs, the proposed cationic lipids rich in secondary amines can efficiently deliver mRNA both in vitro and in vivo as the standalone carriers. Furthermore, these vectors facilitate efficacious mRNA delivery to the T cell subsets following intravenous administration, demonstrating substantial potential for advancing immunotherapy applications.

         <title>Reversal of the Regioselectivity of Iron&#8208;Promoted Hydrogenation and Hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction regioselectivity of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes is dependent on the intrinsic polarity. Thus, the reversal of the regiose&#8208;lectivity of the addition reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we described an unprecedented reversal of regioselectivity of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes triggered by Fe&#8211;H species for the formation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation of the in&#8208;situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated products. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity of this scenario, leading to the formation of a less stable &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical regioisomer. On basis of this new reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, the iron&#8208;promoted hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the efficient synthesis of aliphatic chlorodifluoromethyl&#8208;, bromodifluoromethyl&#8208; and iododifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds was developed. Particularly, this novel hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes provided an effect and large&#8208;scale access to various iododifluoromethylated compounds of high value for synthetic application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) light&#8208;activated organic photothermal agent that synchronously enables satisfying NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging is highly warranted yet rather challenging on the basis of the overwhelming nonradiative decay. Herein, such an agent, namely TPABT&#8208;TD, was tactfully designed and constructed via employing benzo[c]thiophene moiety as bulky electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge and tailoring the peripheral molecular rotors. Benefitting from its high electron donor&#8211;acceptor strength and finely modulated intramolecular motion, TPABT&#8208;TD simultaneously exhibits ultralong absorption in NIR&#8208;II region, intense fluorescence emission in the NIR&#8208;IIa (1300&#8211;1500 nm) region as nanoaggregates, and high photothermal conversion upon 1064 nm laser irradiation.

         <title>M&#8208;N3 Configuration on Boron Nitride Boosts Singlet Oxygen Generation via Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Selective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an essential reactive species responsible for selective oxidation of organic matter, especially in Fenton&#8208;like processes. However, due to the great limitations in synthesizing catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites, the controllable production and practical application of 1O2 remain challenging. Herein, guided by theoretical simulations, a series of boron nitride&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (BvBN/M, M = Co, Fe, Cu, Ni and Mn) were synthesized to regulate 1O2 generation by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). All the fabricated BvBN/M catalysts with explicit M&#8208;N3 sites promoted the self&#8208;decomposition of the two PMS molecules to generate 1O2 with high selectivity, where BvBN/Co possessed moderate adsorption energy and d&#8208;band center exhibited superior catalytic activity. As an outcome, the BvBN/Co&#8208;PMS system coupled with membrane filtration technology could continuously transform aromatic alcohols to aldehydes with nearly 100% selectivity and conversion rate under mild conditions, suggesting the potential of this novel catalytic system for green organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Formation of C&#8208;N or C=N Bond during Photocatalytic Reductive Coupling Reaction over CdS Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds and nitro compounds represents a straightforward way to attain imines or secondary amines, but it is difficult to control the product selectivity. Herein, we report the selective formation of C&#8722;N or C=N bond readily manipulated through a solvent&#8208;induced hydrogen bond bridge, facilitating the swift photocatalytic reductive coupling process. The reductive&#8208;coupling of nitro compounds with carbonyl compounds using formic acid and sodium formate as the hydrogen donors over CdS nanosheets selectively generates imines with C=N bonds in acetonitrile&#160;solvent; while taking methanol as solvent, the C=N bonds are readily hydrogenated to the C&#8722;N bonds via&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonding activation. Experimental and theoretical study reveals that the building of the hydrogen&#8208;bond bridge between the hydroxyl groups in methanol and the N atoms of the C=N motifs in imines facilitates the transfer of hydrogen atoms from CdS surface to the N atoms in imines upon illumination, resulting in the rapid hydrogenation of the C=N bonds to give rise to the secondary amines with C&#8722;N bonds. Our method provides a simple way to control product selectivity by altering the solvents&#160;in photocatalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogels with Differentiated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks for Bioinspired Stress Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deformation of Mimosa, a hydrogel designed by differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks exhibits stress response behavior. In contrast to current artificial materials, it autonomously undergoes reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state deformation/locomotion responses based on a cooperative regulation mechanism. Furthermore, the hydrogel shows significant potential for time&#8208;dependent &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encoding system.







Abstract
Stress response, an intricate and autonomously coordinated reaction in living organisms, holds a reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state nature. However, existing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials often exhibit single&#8208;step and monotonous reactions due to the limited integration of structural components. Inspired by the cooperative interplay of extensor and flexor cells within Mimosa's pulvini, we present a hydrogel with differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) networks designed to enable the biological stress response. Weak H&#8208;bonding domains resemble flexor cells, confined within a hydrophobic network stabilized by strong H&#8208;bonding clusters (acting like extensor cells). Under external force, strong H&#8208;bonding clusters are disrupted, facilitating water diffusion from the bottom layer and enabling transient expansion pressure gradient along the thickness direction. Subsequently, water diffuses upward, gradually equalizing the pressure, while weak H&#8208;bonding domains undergo cooperative elastic deformation. Consequently, the hydrogel autonomously undergoes a sequence of reversible and pluralistic motion responses, similar to Mimosa's touch&#8208;triggered stress response. Intriguingly, it exhibits stress&#8208;dependent color shifts under polarized light, highlighting its potential for applications in time&#8208;sensitive &#8220;double&#8208;lock&#8221; information encryption systems. This work achieves the coordinated stress response inspired by natural tissues using a simple hydrogel, paving the way for substantial advancements in the development of intelligent soft robots.

         <title>Supramolecular Entanglement in a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Enables Flexible&#8208;Robust Porosity for Highly Efficient Purification of Natural Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of porous materials with flexible&#8208;robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a) with flexible&#8208;robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a features a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure with&#160;dia&#160;topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility&#160;(so&#8208;called flexible&#8208;robust framework). The flexible&#8208;robust porosity of ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;8a was confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and SCXRD&#160;studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8&#160;and n&#8208;C4H10&#160;rather by C2H6&#160;and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8&#160;and n&#8208;C4H10&#160;uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6&#160;over CH4, affording one of the highest n&#8208;C4H10/CH4&#160;selectivities. The gas&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structures coupled with theoretical simulations reveal that the loading of n&#8208;C4H10&#160;can induce an obvious framework expansion along with pore&#8208;pocket opening to improve n&#8208;C4H10&#160;uptake and selectivity, while not for C2H6&#160;adsorption.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of porous materials with flexible-robust characteristics shows some unique advantages to target high performance for gas separation, but remains a daunting challenge to achieve so far. Herein, we report a carboxyl-based hydrogen-bonded organic framework (ZJU-HOF-8a) with flexible-robust porosity for efficient purification of natural gas. ZJU-HOF-8a features a four-fold interpenetrated structure with&#160;dia&#160;topology, wherein abundant supramolecular entanglements are formed between the adjacent subnetworks through weak intermolecular hydrogen bonds. This structural configuration could stabilize the whole framework to establish the permanent porosity, but also enable the framework to show some flexibility&#160;(so-called flexible-robust framework). The flexible-robust porosity of ZJU-HOF-8a was confirmed by gas sorption isotherms and SCXRD&#160;studies, showing that the flexible pore pockets can be opened by C3H8&#160;and n-C4H10&#160;rather by C2H6&#160;and CH4. This leads to notably higher C3H8&#160;and n-C4H10&#160;uptakes with enhanced selectivities than C2H6&#160;over CH4, affording one of the highest n-C4H10/CH4&#160;selectivities.

         <title>Considerable Piezochromism in All&#8208;Inorganic Zero&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials refer to a class of matters that alter their photoluminescence (PL) colors in response to the external stimuli, which exhibit promising smart applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optoelectronic memory and pressure&#8208;sensing. However, so far, most reported piezochromic materials have been confined to organic materials or hybrid materials containing organic moieties with limited piezochromic range of less than 100 nm in visible region. Here, we achieved an intriguing piezochromism in all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals (NCs) with a considerable piezochromic range of 232 nm because of their unique inorganic rigid structure. The PL energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85 eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83 eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range. Pressure&#8208;modulated self&#8208;trapped exciton emission between different energy levels of self&#8208;trapped states within Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs was the main reason for this piezochromism property. Note that the quenched emission, which is over five times more intense than that in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon decompression. This work provides a promising pressure indicating material, particularly used in pressure stability monitoring for equipment working at extreme environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Secretoglobin 3A2 Covalent Homodimer and Photocaged Monomeric Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 belongs to an intriguing family of small, secreted proteins present only in mammals. Although members of the SCGB protein family have distinct amino&#8208;acid sequences, they share structural similarities. Of particularly interest is the not yet fully understood self&#8208;assembly ability of SCGBs, which arise from covalent disulfide dimerization and non&#8208;covalent oligomerization. Recently, SCGB3A2 has attracted attention for its singular expression profile in airways. However, the knowledge on SCGB3A2 (patho)physiology derives exclusively from in&#8208;vivo and complex ex&#8208;vivo mixtures, which hampers characterization of the mechanisms driving SCGB3A2 structural behavior. In this report, we document the chemical synthesis of SCGB3A2 in multi&#8208;milligram quantities. Key to access both monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric SCGB3A2 analogues was the use of KAHA ligation and enabled masking of the cysteine residue. The synthetic proteins were used to investigate SCGB3A2 self&#8208;assembly profile, confirming their high propensity to dimerization even in the absence of the key Cys residue.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Dual&#8208;Locked &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; Drug for Selective and Traceless Release in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked approach to embed a small&#8208;molecule drug in a cyclic structure to control bioactivity is described, with the possibility to introduce cell&#8208;targeting entities. Selective and traceless release of the active drug occurs under intracellular conditions found in cancer cells owing to the dual lock and targeting entities.







Abstract
Drug safety and efficacy due to premature release into the bloodstream and poor biodistribution remains a problem despite seminal advances in this area. To circumvent these limitations, we report drug cyclization based on dynamic covalent linkages to devise a dual lock for the small&#8208;molecule anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT). Drug activity is &#8220;locked&#8221; within the cyclic structure by the redox responsive disulfide and pH&#8208;responsive boronic acid&#8208;salicylhydroxamate and turns on only in the presence of acidic pH, reactive oxygen species and glutathione through traceless release. Notably, the dual&#8208;responsive CPT is more active (100&#8208;fold) than the non&#8208;cleavable (permanently closed) analogue. We further include a bioorthogonal handle in the backbone for functionalization to generate cyclic&#8208;locked, cell&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;CPTs, for targeted delivery of the drug and traceless release in triple negative metastatic breast cancer cells to inhibit cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations.

         <title>Engineering Biocatalysts for the C&#8722;H Activation of Fatty Acids by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of biocatalysts for the regioselective mid&#8208; and end&#8208;chain C&#8722;H activation of fatty acids to generate hydroxy acids is described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to the multidomain enzyme family of CYP116B cytochrome P450 monooxygenases to generate ancestor variants with distinct product and thermostability profiles.







Abstract
Selective, one&#8208;step C&#8722;H activation of fatty acids from biomass is an attractive concept in sustainable chemistry. Biocatalysis has shown promise for generating high&#8208;value hydroxy acids, but to date enzyme discovery has relied on laborious screening and produced limited hits, which predominantly oxidise the subterminal positions of fatty acids. Herein we show that ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is an effective tool to explore the sequence&#8208;activity landscape of a family of multidomain, self&#8208;sufficient P450 monooxygenases. We resurrected 11 catalytically active CYP116B ancestors, each with a unique regioselectivity fingerprint that varied from subterminal in the older ancestors to mid&#8208;chain in the lineage leading to the extant, P450&#8208;TT. In lineages leading to extant enzymes in thermophiles, thermostability increased from ancestral to extant forms, as expected if thermophily had arisen de novo. Our studies show that ASR can be applied to multidomain enzymes to develop active, self&#8208;sufficient monooxygenases as regioselective biocatalysts for fatty acid hydroxylation.

         <title>Enhanced Detection of Novel Low&#8208;Frequency Gene Fusions via High&#8208;Yield Ligation and Multiplexed Enrichment Sequencing</title>

The state of double&#8208;strand stem in adapter imposes effect on ligation strategy and reaction equilibrium. We conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double&#8208;stranded adapter DNA and cascaded it with blocker displacement amplification technology, enabling improved ligation yield with enhanced conversion efficiency and selective enrichment in mutations with low variant allele frequency.







Abstract
Panel&#8208;based methods are commonly employed for the analysis of novel gene fusions in precision diagnostics and new drug development in cancer. However, these methods are constrained by limitations in ligation yield and the enrichment of novel gene fusions with low variant allele frequencies. In this study, we conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double&#8208;stranded adapter DNA, resulting in improved ligation yield and enhanced conversion efficiency. Additionally, we implemented blocker displacement amplification, achieving a remarkable 7&#8208;fold enrichment of novel gene fusions. Leveraging the pre&#8208;enrichment achieved with this approach, we successfully applied it to Nanopore sequencing, enabling ultra&#8208;fast analysis of novel gene fusions within one hour with high sensitivity. This method offers a robust and remarkably sensitive mean of analyzing novel gene fusions, promising the discovery of pivotal biomarkers that can significantly improve cancer diagnostics and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

We conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double-stranded adapter DNA and cascaded it with blocker displacement amplification technology, enabling improved ligation yield with enhanced conversion efficiency and selective enrichment in mutations with low variant allele frequency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel-based methods are commonly employed for the analysis of novel gene fusions in precision diagnostics and new drug development in cancer. However, these methods are constrained by limitations in ligation yield and the enrichment of novel gene fusions with low variant allele frequencies. In this study, we conducted a pioneering investigation into the stability of double-stranded adapter DNA, resulting in improved ligation yield and enhanced conversion efficiency. Additionally, we implemented blocker displacement amplification, achieving a remarkable 7-fold enrichment of novel gene fusions. Leveraging the pre-enrichment achieved with this approach, we successfully applied it to Nanopore sequencing, enabling ultra-fast analysis of novel gene fusions within one hour with high sensitivity. This method offers a robust and remarkably sensitive mean of analyzing novel gene fusions, promising the discovery of pivotal biomarkers that can significantly improve cancer diagnostics and the development of new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transpassive Metal Dissolution vs. Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Implication for Alloy Stability and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) have sparked significant interest for their corrosion and electrocatalytic stability. Investigating the CrCoNi alloy revealed substantial metal dissolution during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without typical corrosion indicators. This finding impacts MPEA stability understanding, emphasizing the need of precise OER catalyst efficiency measurements through metal ion quantification.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across a broad pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1&#8197;M NaCl, pH&#8197;2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region, despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for OER&#8208;onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV/Vis) spectrometry to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity of analytically determining metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.

         <title>Li+ Cations Activate NiFeOOH for Oxygen Evolution in Sodium and Potassium Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction on NiFeOOH has a known activity dependence on the electrolyte composition: CsOH&gt;Na/KOH&gt;LiOH. Here, we show that addition of LiOH to NaOH at constant pH results in improved OER rates due to mitigation of non&#8208;kinetic effects. We show that this is due increased intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide into the layered material in the presence of Li+.







Abstract
The efficiency of electrolysis is reduced due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides catalyst properties, electrocatalytic activity also depends on the interaction of the electrocatalyst with the electrolyte. Here, we show that the addition of small amounts of Li+ to Fe&#8208;free NaOH or KOH electrolytes activates NiFeOOH for the OER compared to single&#8208;cation electrolytes. Moreover, the activation was maintained when the solution was returned to pure NaOH. Importantly, we show that the origin of activation by Li+ cations is primarily non&#8208;kinetic in nature, as the OER onset for the mixed electrolyte does not change and the Tafel slope at low current density is ~30&#8197;mV/dec in both electrolytes. However, the increase of the apparent Tafel slope remains lower at increasing current densities in the presence of Li+. Based on electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we show that this reduction of non&#8208;kinetic effects is due to enhanced intercalation of sodium, water and hydroxide. This enhanced electrolyte penetration facilitates the OER, especially at higher current densities and for increased catalyst loading. Our work shows that mixed electrolytes where distinct cations can have different roles provide a simple and promising strategy towards improved OER rates.

         <title>Optimizing Intermediate Adsorption over PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) Bimetallene for Boosted Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8211;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants play a key role in precisely tuning the electronic state and optimizing intermediates adsorption, thus facilitating nitrate reduction to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NO3RR) is a promising and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for ammonia production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the eight&#8208;electron transfer process and poor mechanistic understanding strongly impedes its application. To unveil the internal laws, herein, a library of Pd&#8208;based bimetallene with various transition metal dopants (PdM (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu)) are screened to learn their structure&#8211;activity relationship towards NO3RR. The ultra&#8208;thin structure of metallene greatly facilitates the exposure of active sites, and the transition metals dopants break the electronic balance and upshift its d&#8208;band center, thus optimizing intermediates adsorption. The anisotropic electronic characteristics of these transition metals make the NO3RR activity in the order of PdCu&gt;PdCo&#8776;PdFe&gt;PdNi&gt;Pd, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 295&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 along with Faradaic efficiency of 90.9&#8201;% is achieved in neutral electrolyte on PdCu bimetallene. Detailed studies further reveal that the moderate N&#8208;species (*NO3 and *NO2) adsorption ability, enhanced *NO activation, and reduced HER activity facilitate the NH3 production. We believe our results will give a systematic guidance to the future design of NO3RR catalysts.

         <title>&#8220;Off&#8208;Label Use&#8221; of the Siderophore Enterobactin Enables Targeted Imaging of Cancer with Radioactive Ti(IV)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional, cancer&#8208;targeting version of the siderophore enterobactin (Ent) was identified as an ideal carrier for the targeted delivery of radioactive titanium&#8208;45 to tumors in a mouse model of cancer. This is the first demonstration of targeted imaging with the Ti&#8208;45 isotope, opening new possibilities for nuclear imaging applications with radiometals.







Abstract
The development of inert, biocompatible chelation methods is required to harness the emerging positron emitting radionuclide 45Ti for radiopharmaceutical applications. Herein, we evaluate the Ti(IV)&#8208;coordination chemistry of four catechol&#8208;based, hexacoordinate chelators using synthetic, structural, computational, and radiochemical approaches. The siderophore enterobactin (Ent) and its synthetic mimic TREN&#8208;CAM readily form mononuclear Ti(IV) species in aqueous solution at neutral pH. Radiolabeling studies reveal that Ent and TREN&#8208;CAM form mononuclear complexes with the short&#8208;lived, positron&#8208;emitting radionuclide 45Ti(IV), and do not transchelate to plasma proteins in vitro and exhibit rapid renal clearance in na&#239;ve mice. These features guide efforts to target the 45Ti isotope to prostate cancer tissue through the design, synthesis, and evaluation of Ent&#8208;DUPA, a small molecule conjugate composed of a prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting peptide and a monofunctionalized Ent scaffold. The [45Ti][Ti(Ent&#8208;DUPA)]2&#8722; complex forms readily at room temperature. In a tumor xenograft model in mice, selective tumor tissue accumulation (8&#177;5&#8201;%, n=5), and low off&#8208;target uptake in other organs is observed. Overall, this work demonstrates targeted imaging with 45Ti(IV), provides a foundation for advancing the application of 45Ti in nuclear medicine, and reveals that Ent can be repurposed as a 45Ti&#8208;complexing cargo for targeted nuclear imaging applications.

         <title>The Versatile Establishment of Charge Storage in Polymer Solid Electrolyte with Enhanced Charge Transfer for LiF&#8208;Rich SEI Generation in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin covalent organic framework (POF) with &#8220;charge storage&#8221; properties is designed and integrated into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to investigate the impact of adequate charge transfer on lithium salt decomposition. The results show that LiTFSI can obtain sufficient charge from POF to promote the formation of LiF&#8208;rich SEl layer, thus improving the cycling performance of the battery.







Abstract
The solid&#8208;state electrolyte interface (SEI) between the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte and the lithium metal anode dramatically affects the overall battery performance. Increasing the content of lithium fluoride (LiF) in SEI can help the uniform deposition of lithium and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites, thus improving the cycle stability performance of lithium batteries. Currently, most methods of constructing LiF SEI involve decomposing the lithium salt by the polar groups of the filler. However, there is a lack of research reports on how to affect the SEI layer of Li&#8208;ion batteries by increasing the charge transfer number. In this study, a porous organic polymer with &#8220;charge storage&#8221; properties was prepared and doped into a polymer composite solid electrolyte to study the effect of sufficient charge transfer on the decomposition of lithium salts. The results show in contrast to porphyrins, the unique structure of POF allows for charge transfer between each individual porphyrin. Therefore, during TFSI&#8722; decomposition to the formation of LiF, TFSI&#8722; can obtain sufficient charge, thereby promoting the break of C&#8722;F and forming the LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Compared with single porphyrin (0.423&#8197;e&#8722;), POF provides 2.7&#8197;times more charge transfer to LiTFSI (1.147&#8197;e&#8722;). The experimental results show that Li//Li symmetric batteries equipped with PEO&#8208;POF can be operated stably for more than 2700&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Even the Li//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) symmetric cells are stable for more than 1100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;1. In addition, LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li batteries have excellent cycling performance at 2&#8197;C (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 750 cycles). Even LiFePO4//PEO&#8208;POF//Li (45&#8197;&#956;m) cells have excellent cycling performance at 1&#8197;C (96&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Even when the PEO&#8208;base is replaced with a PEG&#8208;base and a PVDF&#8208;base, the performance of the cell is still significantly improved. Therefore, we believe that the concept of charge transfer offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance assemblies.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Pyrene&#8208;Based Hole Transporting Material Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Py&#8208;DB with an extended conjugated structure is an effective dopant&#8208;free HTM when applied in n&#8208;i&#8208;p&#8208;type PSCs, affording an efficiency of 24.33&#8201;%, the highest PCE for a dopant&#8208;free small&#8208;molecule HTM.







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is significant to the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we developed a novel star&#8208;shape arylamine HTM, termed Py&#8208;DB, with a pyrene core and carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds as the bridge units. Compared to the reference HTM (termed Py&#8208;C), the extension of the planar conjugation backbone endows Py&#8208;DB with typical intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions and excellent solubility, resulting in improved hole mobility and film morphology. In addition, the lower HOMO energy level of the Py&#8208;DB HTM provides efficient hole extraction with reduced energy loss at the perovskite/HTM interface. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.33&#8201;% was achieved for dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based PSCs, which is the highest PCE for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p configured PSCs. The dopant&#8208;free Py&#8208;DB&#8208;based device also exhibits improved long&#8208;term stability, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;h exposure to 25&#8201;% humidity at 60&#8201;&#176;C. These findings provide valuable insights and approaches for the further development of dopant&#8208;free HTMs for efficient and reliable PSCs.

         <title>The Synthesis and Reactivity of Naphthoquinonynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first systematic exploration of the synthesis and reactivity of naphthoquinonynes is described. Routes to two regioisomeric Kobayashi&#8208;type naphthoquinonyne precursors have been developed, and the reactivity of the ensuing aryne intermediates has been investigated. A broad range of cycloadditions, nucleophile additions and difunctionalizations can be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the highly sensitive quinone unit.







Abstract
The first systematic exploration of the synthesis and reactivity of naphthoquinonynes is described. Routes to two regioisomeric Kobayashi&#8208;type naphthoquinonyne precursors have been developed, and the reactivity of the ensuing 6,7&#8208; and 5,6&#8208;aryne intermediates has been investigated. Remarkably, these studies have revealed that a broad range of cycloadditions, nucleophile additions and difunctionalizations can be achieved while maintaining the integrity of the highly sensitive quinone unit. The methodologies offer a powerful diversity oriented approach to C6 and C7 functionalized naphthoquinones, which are typically challenging to access. From a reactivity viewpoint, the study is significant because it demonstrates that aryne&#8208;based functionalizations can be utilized strategically in the presence of highly reactive and directly competing functionality.

         <title>Designing Degradable Polymers from Tricycloalkenes via Complete Cascade Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a complete cascade RORCMP using tricycloalkenes. We found trans tricycloalkenes enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP with TON ~10,000 and Mn up to 170&#8197;kg/mol. Also, one&#8208;shot cascade MOMP was achieved to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation.







Abstract
Cascade metathesis polymerization has been developed as a promising method to synthesize complex but well&#8208;defined polymers from monomers containing multiple reactive functional groups. However, this approach has been limited to the monomers involving simple alkene/alkyne moieties or produced mainly non&#8208;degradable polymers. In this study, we demonstrate a complete cascade ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization (RORCMP) using various tricycloalkenes and two strategies for the efficient degradation. Through rational design of tricycloalkene monomers, the structure and reactivity relationship was explored. For example, tricycloalkenes with trans configuration in the central ring enabled faster and better selective cascade RORCMP than the corresponding cis isomers. Also, a 4&#8208;substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170&#8197;kg/mol using an amide&#8208;containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one&#8208;shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B&#8208;alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose&#8208;based tricycloalkenes to give well&#8208;defined polymers that underwent ultra&#8208;fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.

Also, a 4-substituted cyclopentene moiety in the monomers significantly enhanced the overall cascade RORCMP performance, with the maximum turnover number (TON) reaching almost 10,000 and molecular weight up to 170&#8197;kg/mol using an amide-containing monomer. Furthermore, we achieved one-shot cascade multiple olefin metathesis polymerization using tricycloalkenes and a diacrylate, to produce new highly A,B-alternating copolymers with full degradability. Lastly, we successfully designed xylose-based tricycloalkenes to give well-defined polymers that underwent ultra-fast and complete degradation under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Host&#8211;Microbe Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Ferroptosis&#8208;Associated Heterogeneity during Acinetobacter baumannii Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated scRandom&#8208;seq, a new high&#8208;throughput Random primer&#8208;based host&#8211;microbe dual single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing technology, and applied this technology to an Acinetobacter baumannii (A.b) infection model. We witnessed the ferroptosis&#8208;associated heterogeneity in host cells for the first time, which suggests that ferroptosis may become a new clinical target for resisting A.b infection.







Abstract
Interactions between host and bacterial cells are integral to human physiology. The complexity of host&#8211;microbe interactions extends to different cell types, spatial aspects, and phenotypic heterogeneity, requiring high&#8208;resolution approaches to capture their full complexity. The latest breakthroughs in single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) have opened up a new era of studies in host&#8211;pathogen interactions. Here, we first report a high&#8208;throughput cross&#8208;species dual scRNA&#8208;seq technology by using random primers to simultaneously capture both eukaryotic and bacterial RNAs (scRandom&#8208;seq). Using reference cells, scRandom&#8208;seq can detect individual eukaryotic and bacterial cells with high throughput and high specificity. Acinetobacter baumannii (A.b) is a highly opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen that displays resistance to many antibiotics, posing a significant threat to human health, calling for discoveries and treatment. In the A.b infection model, scRandom&#8208;seq witnessed polarization of THP&#8208;1 derived&#8208;macrophages and the intracellular A.b&#8208;induced ferroptosis&#8208;stress in host cells. The inhibition of ferroptosis by Ferrostatin&#8208;1 (Fer&#8208;1) resulted in the improvement of cell vitality and resistance to A.b infection, indicating the potential to resist related infections. scRandom&#8208;seq provides a high&#8208;throughput cross&#8208;species dual single&#8208;cell RNA profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in unraveling the complex interactions of host&#8211;microbe interactions in infection systems and tumor micro&#8208;environments.

         <title>Reactivity of Superbasic Carbanions Generated via Reductive Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover in the Context of Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic reactions with a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) involve intermediates with carbanionic reactivity. These are best described as free carbanions. Reactions with such carbanions depend on the balance between their nucleophilicity and basicity. Deprotonation of reaction partners and common organic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide is the main competing reaction to nucleophilic addition.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reactions involving a reductive radical&#8208;polar crossover (RRPCO) generate intermediates with carbanionic reactivity. Many of these proposed intermediates resemble highly reactive organometallic compounds. However, conditions of their formation are generally not tolerated by their isolated organometallic versions and often a different reactivity is observed. Our investigations on their nature and reactivity under commonly used photocatalytic conditions demonstrate that these intermediates are indeed best described as free, superbasic carbanions capable of deprotonating common polar solvents usually assumed to be inert such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide. Their basicity not only towards solvents but also towards electrophiles, such as aldehydes, ketones, and esters, is comparable to the reactivity of isolated carbanions in the gas&#8208;phase. Previously unsuccessful transformations thought to result from a lack of reactivity are explained by their high reactivity towards the solvent and weakly acidic protons of reaction partners. An intuitive explanation for the mode of action of photocatalytically generated carbanions is provided, which enables methods to verify reaction mechanisms proposed to involve an RRPCO step and to identify the reasons for the limitations of current methods.

         <title>Accessing Mg&#8208;Ion Storage in V2PS10 via Combined Cationic&#8208;Anionic Redox with Selective Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
V2PS10 achieves reversible capacity of 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with fast Mg2+ insertion kinetics. Insertion is accompanied by simultaneous anionic and cationic redox on spatially separated sites. The nature of the electron transfer depends on the coordination of individual Mg sites by the distinct sulphur species involved, creating synergy between specific site occupancies and the selective cleavage of one of the two chemically distinct sets of S&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries attract interest as alternative energy&#8208;storage devices because of elemental abundance and potential for high energy density. Development is limited by the absence of suitable cathodes, associated with poor diffusion kinetics resulting from strong interactions between Mg2+ and the host structure. V2PS10 is reported as a positive electrode material for rechargeable magnesium batteries. Cyclable capacity of 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is achieved with fast Mg2+ diffusion of 7.2
10&#8722;11&#8211;4
10&#8722;14&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1. The fast insertion mechanism results from combined cationic redox on the V site and anionic redox on the (S2)2&#8722; site; enabled by reversible cleavage of S&#8722;S bonds, identified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed structural characterisation with maximum entropy method analysis, supported by density functional theory and projected density of states analysis, reveals that the sulphur species involved in anion redox are not connected to the transition metal centres, spatially separating the two redox processes. This facilitates fast and reversible Mg insertion in which the nature of the redox process depends on the cation insertion site, creating a synergy between the occupancy of specific Mg sites and the location of the electrons transferred.

         <title>Appending Coronene Diimide with Carbon Nanohoops Allows for Rapid Intersystem Crossing in Neat Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8221; type coronene diimide&#8208;core double nanohoop (CDI&#8211;CPP), which has significant intra&#8211; and intermolecular charge&#8211;transfer interactions in the solid state, was designed and synthesized. CDI&#8211;CPP can undergo rapid intersystem crossing in neat film with a time constant of 238&#8197;ps.







Abstract
The development of innovative triplet materials plays a significant role in various applications. Although effective tuning of triplet formation by intersystem crossing (ISC) has been well established in solution, the modulation of ISC processes in the solid state remains a challenge due to the presence of other exciton decay channels through intermolecular interactions. The cyclic structure of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) offers a unique platform to tune the intermolecular packing, which leads to controllable exciton dynamics in the solid state. Herein, by integrating an electron deficient coronene diimide (CDI) unit into the CPP framework, a donor&#8208;acceptor type of conjugated macrocycle (CDI&#8208;CPP) featuring intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interaction was designed and synthesized. Effective intermolecular CT interaction resulting from a slipped herringbone packing was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Transient spectroscopy studies showed that CDI&#8208;CPP undergoes ISC in both solution and the film state, with triplet generation time constants of 4.5&#8197;ns and 238&#8197;ps, respectively. The rapid triplet formation through ISC in the film state can be ascribed to the cooperation between intra&#8208; and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions. Our results highlight that intermolecular CT interaction has a pronounced effect on the ISC process in the solid state, and shed light on the use of the characteristic structure of CPPs to manipulate intermolecular CT interactions.

Our results highlight that intermolecular CT interaction has a pronounced effect on the ISC process in the solid state, and shed light on the use of the characteristic structure of CPPs to manipulate intermolecular CT interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Silole and Disila&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silole derivatives and nanoribbon structures with eight&#8208;membered sila&#8208;cyclic rings were successfully synthesized on Au(111) through reactions between bromo&#8208;substituted molecules and silicon atoms. Their chemical structures were investigated by bond&#8208;resolved STM and DFT calculations. The band gaps of the silole derivatives and the nanoribbon measured with STS measurements were 3.1&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively.







Abstract
The incorporation of Si atoms into organic compounds significantly increases a variety of functionality, facilitating further applications. Recently, on&#8208;surface synthesis was introduced into organosilicon chemistry as 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene bridged nanostructures were obtained via coupling between silicon atoms and brominated phenyl groups at the ortho position on Au(111). Here, we demonstrate a high generality of this strategy via syntheses of silole derivatives and nanoribbon structures with eight&#8208;membered sila&#8208;cyclic rings from dibrominated molecules at the bay and peri positions on Au(111), respectively. Their structures and electronic properties were investigated by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This work demonstrates a great potential to deal with heavy group 14 elements in on&#8208;surface silicon chemistry.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Heck Coupling and Allylboration of Iododiboron Compounds via Diboryl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambiphilic reactivity of iododiboron compounds was disclosed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reactions of iododiborons, alkenes and aldehydes/imines. The reaction features mild conditions, broad scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and functional group tolerance. An unconventional Pd(0/I/II) catalytic cycle is operative, supported by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Geminal bis(boronates) are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic chemistry. The fact that they predominantly serve as nucleophiles in the previous reports, however, has restrained their synthetic potential. Herein we disclose the ambiphilic reactivity of &#945;&#8208;halogenated geminal bis(boronates), of which the first catalytic utilization was accomplished by merging a formal Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a highly diastereoselective allylboration of aldehydes or imines, providing a new avenue for rapid assembly of polyfunctionalized boron&#8208;containing compounds. We demonstrated that this cascade reaction is highly efficient and compatible with various functional groups, and a wide range of heterocycles. In contrast to a classical Pd(0/II) scenario, mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations have provided strong evidence for a catalytic cycle involving Pd(I)/diboryl carbon radical intermediates.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Dialane&#8208;Bridged Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, dialane&#8208;bridged diradical species has been synthesized that exists in two conformers&#8212;twisted and planar&#8212;depending on the solvent of crystallization. Both conformers have been isolated and thoroughly characterized using various analytical techniques. Their reactivity has been examined with oxidizing agents to demonstrate the reduction capability of diradicals.







Abstract
Radicals of the lightest group 13 element, boron, are well established and observed in numerous forms. In contrast to boron, radical chemistry involving the heavier group 13 elements (aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium) remains largely underexplored, primarily attributed to the formidable synthetic challenges associated with these elements. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of planar and twisted conformers of a doubly CAAC (cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene)&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted dialane. Extensive characterization through spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms their identity, while quantum chemical calculations support their open&#8208;shell nature and provide further insights into their electronic structures. The dialane&#8208;connected diradicals exhibit high susceptibility to oxidation, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements and reactions with o&#8208;chloranil and a variety of organic azides. This study opens a previously uncharted class of dialuminum systems to study, broadening the scope of diradical chemistry and its potential applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Tricoordinate Organoberyllium Azides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first two examples of molecular tricoordinate organoberyllium azides were synthesized via salt metathesis as well as radical recombination. First reactivity studies on these compounds reveal extensive ligand scrambling, the formation of a unique &#947;&#8208;azide borole adduct, as well as the potential to generate highly reactive beryllium nitrene intermediates.







Abstract
A series of terminal mono&#8208; and disubstituted beryllium azides of the form [(CAAC)Be(N3)R] (R=CAACH, Dur; CAACH/CAAC=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl/idene, Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) and [L2Be(N3)2] (L=CAACNH=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;imine, IiPrMe=1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), respectively, were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Thermolysis and photolysis products of these first examples of tricoordinate azidoberyllium complexes evidence extensive ligand scrambling and the formal insertion of nitrenes into the CAAC&#8722;Be bond, generating cyclic alkyl(amino)imine (CAAI) ligands. Furthermore, the reaction with a small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) leads to unexpected CAAC&#8208;NHC ligand exchange, while the reaction with pentaphenylborole yields the first &#947;&#8208;azide adduct of a borole, long postulated to be the first step in the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines from boroles and azides.

         <title>Cyclopropenimine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Activation for the Synthesis of Polyurethanes and Small&#8208;Molecule Carbonates and Carbamates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>

Cyclopropenimine, polyurethane, carbon dioxide, carbamates, organocatalysisCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Organo&#8208;carbonation (OrCa) polymerization employs the superbase cyclopropenimine to bind CO2 and mediate its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. Cyclopropenimine is recyclable and this procedure provides direct access to N&#8208;alkylated polyurethanes.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Given the adverse impact of CO2 on the atmosphere, it is of paramount importance to devise strategies for upcycling it into useful materials, such as polymers and fine chemicals. To activate such stable molecule, superbases offer viable modes of binding to CO2. In this study, a superbase cyclopropenimine derivative was found to exhibit exceptional proficiency in activating CO2 and mediating its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. The versatility of this reaction can be extended to monofunctional amines and alcohols, yielding a variety of functional carbonates and carbamates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an abundant C1 feedstock with tremendous potential to produce versatile building blocks in synthetic applications. Given the adverse impact of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the atmosphere, it is of paramount importance to devise strategies for upcycling it into useful materials, such as polymers and fine chemicals. To activate such stable molecule, superbases offer viable modes of binding to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study, a superbase cyclopropenimine derivative was found to exhibit exceptional proficiency in activating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and mediating its polymerization at ambient temperature and pressure for the synthesis of polyurethanes. The versatility of this reaction can be extended to monofunctional amines and alcohols, yielding a variety of functional carbonates and carbamates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correlation between Heteroatom Coordination and Hydrogen Evolution for Single&#8208;site Pt on Carbon&#8208;based Nanocages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Pt single&#8208;site catalysts was constructed and exhibited increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along the S&#8208;, P&#8208;, C&#8208; and N&#8208;coordinated Pt. The structure&#8208;performance correlation is established. The multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption deepens the understanding of activity and stability. The density of states (DOS) of Pt 5d orbitals near Fermi level (Ef) can promote the activity by facilitating electron transfer and proton capture.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic performance of single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs) is closely correlated with the electronic structure of metal atoms. Herein we construct a series of Pt SSCs on heteroatom&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon nanocages, which exhibit increasing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities along S&#8208;doped, P&#8208;doped, undoped and N&#8208;doped supports. Theoretical simulation indicates a multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process on Pt SSCs due to the low coordination, and a reasonable descriptor is figured out to evaluate the HER activities. Relative to C&#8208;coordinated Pt, N&#8208;coordinated Pt has higher reactivity due to the electron transfer of N&#8208;to&#8208;Pt, which enriches the density of states of Pt 5d orbital near the Fermi level and facilitates the capturing of protons, just the opposite to the situations for P&#8208; and S&#8208;coordinated ones. The stable N&#8208;coordinated Pt originates from the kinetic stability throughout the multi&#8208;H&#8208;atom adsorption process. This finding provides a significant guidance for rational design of advanced Pt SSCs on carbon&#8208;based supports.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Integration of Phosphor, Initiator, and Crosslinker for the Photo&#8208;Polymerization of Flexible Phosphorescent Polymer Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional phosphorescence molecule, benzothiadiazole&#8208;based dialkene (BTD&#8208;HEA), has been developed, serving as both photo&#8208;initiator and crosslinker. It facilitates the rapid polymerization of various acrylate&#8208;based monomers into flexible phosphorescent gels within 120&#8197;s, while enabling real&#8208;time in situ monitoring. The versatility of BTD&#8208;HEA underscores its potential applications in the fields of bioimaging and wearable optoelectronics.







Abstract
A general approach to constructing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials involves the incorporation of a phosphorescent emitter into a rigid host or polymers with high glass transition temperature. However, these materials often suffer from poor processability and suboptimal mechanical properties, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we developed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based dialkene (BTD&#8208;HEA), a multifunctional phosphorescent emitter with a remarkable yield of intersystem crossing (&#934;ISC, 99.83&#8201;%). Its high triplet exciton generation ability and dialkene structure enable BTD&#8208;HEA to act as a photoinitiator and crosslinker, efficiently initiating the polymerization of various monomers within 120&#8197;seconds. A range of flexible phosphorescence gels, including hydrogels, organogels, ionogels, and aerogels were fabricated, which exhibit outstanding stretchability and recoverability. Furthermore, the unique fluorescent&#8208;phosphorescent colorimetric properties of the gels provide a more sensitive method for the visual determination of the polymerization process. Notably, the phosphorescent emission intensity of the hydrogel can be increased by the formation of ice, allowing for the precise detection of hydrogel freezing. The versatility of this emitter paves the way for fabricating various flexible phosphorescence gels with diverse morphologies using microfluidics, film&#8208;shearing, roll coating process, and two/three&#8208;dimensional printing, showcasing its potential applications in the fields of bioimaging and bioengineering.

         <title>Site&#8208;Isolated Rhodium(II) Metalloradicals Catalyze Olefin Hydrofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenization of Rh(II) porphyrin catalysts in a metal&#8211;organic framework is crucial for catalyst turnover in thermal olefin hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation. Unlike MOF&#8208;supported metalloradical catalysts, homogeneous analogues convert to closed shell species that obstruct catalytic turnover. Site&#8208;isolated Rh(II) metalloradicals are readily accessed via MOF synthesis with a linker containing a metal&#8208;alkyl bond followed by Rh&#8722;C photolysis.







Abstract
Rh(II) porphyrin complexes display pronounced metal&#8208;centered radical character and the ability to activate small molecules under mild conditions, but catalysis with Rh(II) porphyrins is extremely rare. In addition to facile dimerization, Rh(II) porphyrins readily engage in kinetically and thermodynamically facile reactions involving two Rh(II) centers to generate stable Rh(III)&#8722;X intermediates that obstruct turnover in thermal catalysis. Here we report site isolation of Rh(II) metalloradicals in a MOF host, which not only protects Rh(II) metalloradicals against dimerization, but also allows them to participate in thermal catalysis. Access to PCN&#8208;224 or PCN&#8208;222 in which the porphyrin linkers are fully metalated by Rh(II) in the absence of any accompanying Rh(0) nanoparticles was achieved via the first direct MOF synthesis with a linker containing a transition&#8208;metal alkyl moiety, followed by Rh(III)&#8722;C bond photolysis.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Tailored PVDF&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residual DMF solvents in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes suffered from inevitably serious side reactions with high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode and lithium metal anode which restrict the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state Li||NCM811 cells. We proposed a novel strategy of anchoring DMF solvents by incorporating low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers to modulate the solvation structures in PVDF&#8208;based solid state electrolyte. Inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and CEI derived from the tailored anion&#8208;rich solvated structure guarantee long&#8208;term cycling stability of the solid&#8208;state Li||NCM811&#8197;cell at high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V.







Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electro&#8208;lytes are attracting increasing attention for high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries because of their high room temperature ionic conductivity, adequate mechanical strength and good thermal stability. However, the presence of highly reactive residual solvents, such as N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), severely jeopardizes the long&#8208;term cycling stability. Herein, we propose a solvation&#8208;tailoring strategy to confine residual solvent molecules by introducing low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite molecular sieves as fillers. The strong interaction between DMF and the molecular sieve weakens the ability of DMF to participate in the solvation of Li+, leading to more anions being involved in solvation. Benefiting from the tailored anion&#8208;rich coordination environment, the interfacial side reactions with the lithium anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode are effectively suppressed. As a result, the solid&#8208;state Li||Li symmetrical cells demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 5100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li||NCM811 full cells achieve excellent cycling stability for more than 1130 and 250 cycles under the charging cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively. Our work is an innovative exploration to address the negative effects of residual DMF in PVDF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes and highlights the importance of modulating the solvation structures in solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes.

As a result, the solid-state Li||Li symmetrical cells demonstrates ultra-stable cycling over 5100&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the Li||NCM811 full cells achieve excellent cycling stability for more than 1130 and 250 cycles under the charging cut-off voltages of 4.3&#8197;V and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively. Our work is an innovative exploration to address the negative effects of residual DMF in PVDF-based solid-state electrolytes and highlights the importance of modulating the solvation structures in solid-state polymer electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Doping Inhibits the Formation of Isomerization&#8208;Derived Structural Defects in N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive doping effectively prevents the creation of defects caused by structural changes (isomerization) during the production of n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF). This process involves several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, the integer charge transfer, or the formation of charge transfer complexes, to stop structural isomerization.







Abstract
Recently, solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has been made through in&#8208;situ oxidative polymerization and reductive doping, which exhibited exceptionally high electrical conductivities and optical transparency. The discovery of n&#8208;PBDF is considered a breakthrough in the field of organic semiconductors. In the initial report, the possibility of structural defect formation in n&#8208;PBDF was proposed, based on the observation of structural isomerization from (E)&#8208;2H,2&#8242;H&#8208;[3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuranylidene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dione (isoxindigo) to chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]chromene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione (dibenzonaphthyrone) in the dimer model reactions. In this study, we present clear evidence that structural isomerization is inhibited during polymerization. We reveal that the dimer (BFD1) and the trimer (BFD2) can be reductively doped by several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, forming charge transfer complexes (CTC) or undergoing an integer charge transfer (ICT) with reactants available during polymerization. Once the hydride transfer adducts, the CTC, or the ICT product forms, structural isomerization can be effectively prevented even at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why isomerization&#8208;derived structural defects are absent in n&#8208;PBDF backbone. It lays a solid foundation for the future development of n&#8208;PBDF as a benchmark polymer for organic electronics and beyond.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell, Single&#8208;Mitochondrial DNA Assay Using Hydrogel Droplet Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While understanding mtDNA heteroplasmy and intercellular heterogeneity requires single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis, existing methods restrict studies to small cell populations. We present a high&#8208;throughput, multiplex method for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis using rolling circle amplification and hydrogel droplet microfluidics.







Abstract
There is growing interest in understanding the biological implications of single cell heterogeneity and heteroplasmy of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but current methodologies for single&#8208;cell mtDNA analysis limit the scale of analysis to small cell populations. Although droplet microfluidics have increased the throughput of single&#8208;cell genomic, RNA, and protein analysis, their application to sub&#8208;cellular organelle analysis has remained a largely unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce an agarose&#8208;based droplet microfluidic approach for single&#8208;cell, single&#8208;mtDNA analysis, which allows simultaneous processing of hundreds of individual mtDNA molecules within &gt;10,000 individual cells. Our microfluidic chip encapsulates individual cells in agarose beads, designed to have a sufficiently dense hydrogel network to retain mtDNA after lysis and provide a robust scaffold for subsequent multi&#8208;step processing and analysis. To mitigate the impact of the high viscosity of agarose required for mtDNA retention on the throughput of microfluidics, we developed a parallelized device, successfully achieving ~95&#8201;% mtDNA retention from single cells within our microbeads at &gt;700,000 drops/minute. To demonstrate utility, we analyzed specific regions of the single&#8208;mtDNA using a multiplexed rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay. We demonstrated compatibility with both microscopy, for digital counting of individual RCA products, and flow cytometry for higher throughput analysis.

         <title>Aza[5]helicene&#8208;Derived Semiconducting Polymers for Improved Performance in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exploring Energetic and Morphological Influences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating copolymer of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, and phenoxazine, featured by matched energy levels, excellent film&#8208;forming properties, enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, was demonstrated for perovskite solar cells, which attain average initial efficiency of 25.5&#8201;%, excellent 85&#8201;&#176;C thermal stability, and operational stability under the full sunlight.







Abstract
The strategic design of solution&#8208;processable semiconducting polymers possessing both matched energy levels and elevated glass transition temperatures is of urgent importance in the progression of thermally robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 25&#8201;%. In this work, we employed direct arylation polymerization to achieve the high&#8208;yield synthesis of three aza[5]helicene&#8208;derived copolymers with distinct HOMO energy levels and exceptional glass transition temperatures. Upon integration of these semiconducting polymers into formamidinium lead triiodide&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, marked disparities in photovoltaic parameters manifest, primarily stemming from variations in the electrical conductivity and film morphology of the hole transport layers. The p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E copolymer, featuring a main chain comprising alternating repeats of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, phenoxazine, and ethylenedioxythiophene, attains an initial average efficiency of 25.5&#8201;%, markedly surpassing reference materials such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (23.0&#8201;%), PTAA (17.0&#8201;%), and P3HT (11.6&#8201;%). Notably, p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E exhibits a high cohesive energy density, resulting in enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, thereby conferring perovskite solar cells with exceptional 85&#8201;&#176;C tolerance and operational stability.

         <title>The Rhodium Analogue of Coenzyme B12 as an Anti&#8208;Photoregulatory Ligand Inhibiting Bacterial CarH Photoreceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CarH photoreceptors bound to photolabile cobalt corrin coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) are DNA&#8208;binding tetramers that repress genes for carotenoid synthesis in the dark. Light triggers AdoCbl photolysis and CarH tetramer disassembly to activate gene expression. AdoRhbl, a synthetic photostable isostructural rhodium surrogate of AdoCbl, emulates AdoCbl in CarH binding, tetramerization and DNA binding yet blocks photoregulation by CarH in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl; 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;adenosylcobalamin), the quintessential biological organometallic radical catalyst, has a formerly unanticipated, yet extensive, role in photoregulation in bacteria. The light&#8208;responsive cobalt&#8208;corrin AdoCbl performs this nonenzymatic role by facilitating the assembly of CarH photoreceptors into DNA&#8208;binding tetramers in the dark, suppressing gene expression. Conversely, exposure to light triggers the decomposition of this AdoCbl&#8208;bound complex by a still elusive photochemical mechanism, activating gene expression. Here, we have examined AdoRhbl, the non&#8208;natural rhodium analogue of AdoCbl, as a photostable isostructural surrogate for AdoCbl. We show that AdoRhbl closely emulates AdoCbl in its uptake by bacterial cells and structural functionality as a regulatory ligand for CarH tetramerization, DNA binding, and repressor activity. Remarkably, we find AdoRhbl is photostable even when bound &#8220;base&#8208;off/His&#8208;on&#8221; to CarH in vitro and in vivo. Thus, AdoRhbl, an antivitamin B12, also represents an unprecedented anti&#8208;photoregulatory ligand, opening a pathway to precisely target biomimetic inhibition of AdoCbl&#8208;based photoregulation, with new possibilities for selective antibacterial applications. Computational biomolecular analysis of AdoRhbl binding to CarH yields detailed structural insights into this complex, which suggest that the adenosyl group of photoexcited AdoCbl bound to CarH may specifically undergo a concerted non&#8208;radical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination mechanism, an aspect not previously considered for this photoreceptor.

Computational biomolecular analysis of AdoRhbl binding to CarH yields detailed structural insights into this complex, which suggest that the adenosyl group of photoexcited AdoCbl bound to CarH may specifically undergo a concerted non-radical &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-elimination mechanism, an aspect not previously considered for this photoreceptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Potential Structure Design Breaks Electrolyte Limitations of Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective molecular design strategy was proposed to provide a favorable reaction environment for high&#8208;capacity electrodes with a bifunctional potential region. The proton&#8208;doping chemistry of polyaniline resulted in localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, thus broadening the pH applicability of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are safe and economical for grid applications. However, current ZIBs have limitations in terms of inferior capacity and low output voltage, which are hampered by the electrolyte applicability of the Zn2+ hosts. In this study, we propose a novel organic cathode design strategy with a bifunctional potential region. This polymeric Zn2+ host combines the conjugated polyaniline backbone to tune the molecular surface pH and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; redox couple for high output voltage and capacity. The polyaniline doped with ferricyanide (PAF) electrode exhibits two forms of charge storage in ZIBs: proton&#8208;assisted Zn2+ doping below 1.2&#8197;V (mechanism I), and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722; redox pair above 1.8&#8197;V (mechanism II). Density functional theory calculations and in situ pH experiments demonstrated that the H+ doping process of mechanism I forms a localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, providing a favorable reaction environment for mechanism II. The Zn&#8208;polymer battery delivered an outstanding discharge capacity (405.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high output voltage (1.8&#8197;V) in the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. This study provides a new route for enhancing the structural stability of electrodes and overcoming the electrolyte limitations of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.

         <title>Cyclic Amine Synthesis via Catalytic Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic amine synthesis has been achieved by a catalytic radical&#8208;polar crossover cycloaddition (RPCC) triggered from primary sulfonamide under photoredox condition. The newly developed disconnection allows to construct &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted and &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amines. This study highlights the unique utility of primary sulfonamides as bifunctional reagents, which act as radical precursors and nucleophiles.







Abstract
The rapid assembly of valuable cyclic amine architectures in a single step from simple precursors has been recognized as an ideal platform in term of efficiency and sustainability. Although a vast number of studies regarding cyclic amine synthesis has been reported, new synthetic disconnection approaches are still high in demand. Herein, we report a catalytic radical&#8208;polar crossover cycloaddition to cyclic amine synthesis triggered from primary sulfonamide under photoredox condition. This newly developed disconnection, comparable to established synthetic approaches, will allow to construct &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclic amine and &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amine derivatives efficiently. This study highlights the unique utility of primary sulfonamide as a bifunctional reagent, which acts as a radical precursor and a nucleophile. The open&#8208;shell methodology demonstrates broad tolerance to various functional groups, drug derivatives and natural products in an economically and sustainable fashion.

         <title>In situ and Real&#8208;time Monitoring the Chemical and Thermal Evolution of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>

         <dc:description>
A buried flexible optical fiber in the pouch&#8208;type lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) enable in situ and real&#8208;time temperature monitoring during charge/discharge process. Batteries with single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) cathode show a much lower temperature rise and alleviated phase transition at elevated temperature compared to polycrystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;PC) cathode, highlighting NCM&#8208;SC&#8242;s enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, thermal runaway of LIBs with these cathodes leads to great safety concerns. In this study, single crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) has been prepared and a flexible optical fiber was buried inside the pouch&#8208;type LIBs with NCM&#8208;SC cathode to in situ study its real&#8208;time temperature evolution during charge/discharge process. NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an enhanced Li+ ions transportation efficiency and electrode reaction kinetics, which can effectively reduce the generation of polarization heat and mitigate the internal temperature rise of the pouch&#8208;type battery. Meanwhile, solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) film decomposition and gas accumulation are effectively alleviated, due to the enhanced thermal stability of SEI film formed on NCM&#8208;SC. Moreover, the single crystal architecture can effectively retard layered to spinal and rock&#8208;salt phase transition, mitigate the crack formation and structural collapse. Consequently, NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and enhanced thermal stability.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Porous Fullerene Membranes for Ultimate Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel two&#8208;dimensional (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membranes were assembled by the stacking of porous polymeric fullerene nanosheets. The nanoscale in&#8208;plane pores created by the well&#8208;controlled depolymerization of polymeric fullerene crystals and sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm lateral channels between adjacent polymeric fullerene nanosheets provide ultrashort pathways for the fast permeation and efficient molecular sieving for various organic solvents.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with high chemical stability have attracted intensive interest in membrane design for the separation of organic solvents. As a novel 2D material, polymeric fullerenes (C60)&#8734; with distinctive properties are very promising for the development of innovative membranes. In this work, we report the construction of a 2D (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane for organic solvent separation. The pathways of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane are constructed by sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm lateral channels and nanoscale in&#8208;plane pores created by the depolymerization of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheets. Attributing to ordered and shortened transport pathways, the ultrathin porous (C60)&#8734; membrane is superior in organic solvent separation. The hexane, acetone, and methanol fluxes are up to 1146.3&#177;53, 900.4&#177;41, and 879.5&#177;42&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, which are up to 130 times higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with similar dye rejection. Our findings demonstrate the prospect of 2D (C60)&#8734; as a promising nanofiltration membrane in the separation of organic solvents from macromolecular compounds such as dyes, drugs, hormones, etc.

         <title>Dipolar Chemical Bridge Induced CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with 21.86&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible dipolar chemical bridge is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower the photovoltage deficits of perovskite solar cells. The functional molecules could firmly anchor to the TiO2 surface and chemically bond with the [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedral frameworks of perovskites to ameliorate the interfacial disorder and facilitate charge transport, leading to the perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.86&#8201;% being realized.







Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite receives tremendous attention for photovoltaic applications due to its ideal band gap and good thermal stability. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) significantly suffer from photovoltage deficits because of serious interfacial energy losses within the PSCs, which to a large extent affects the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Herein, a dipolar chemical bridge (DCB) is constructed between the perovskite and TiO2 layers to lower interfacial energy losses and thus improve the charge extraction of PSCs. The results reveal that the DCB could form a beneficial interfacial dipole between the perovskite and TiO2 layers, which could optimize the interfacial energetics of perovskite/TiO2 layers and thus improve the energy level alignment within the PSCs. Meanwhile, the constructed DCB could also simultaneously passivate the surface defects of perovskite and TiO2 layers, greatly lowering interfacial recombination. Consequently, the photovoltage deficit of CsPbI3 PSCs is largely reduced, leading to a record efficiency of 21.86&#8201;% being realized. Meanwhile, the operation stability of PSCs is also largely improved due to the high&#8208;quality perovskite films with released interfacial tensile strain being obtained after forming the DCB within the PSCs.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;stable Supramolecular Framework Based on Consecutive Side&#8208;by&#8208;side Hydrogen Bonds for One&#8208;step C2H4/C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MTHOF&#8208;1) has been successfully assembled by side&#8208;by&#8208;side hydrogen bond chains. This HOF can be used to directly obtain polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from a C2H4/C2H6 mixture at different temperatures and different relative humid conditions.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step efficient separation of high&#8208;purity C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures by hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) faces two problems: lack of strategies for constructing stable pores in HOFs and how to obtain high C2H6 selectivity. Herein, we have developed a microporous Mortise&#8208;Tenon&#8208;type HOF (MTHOF&#8208;1, MT is short for Mortise&#8208;Tenon structure) with a new self&#8208;assembly mode for C2H4/C2H6 separation. Unlike previous HOFs which usually possess discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head hydrogen bonds, MTHOF&#8208;1 is assembled by unique consecutive side&#8208;by&#8208;side hydrogen bonds, which result in mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon pores decorated with orderly arranged amide groups and benzene rings. As expected, MTHOF&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability under various conditions and shows clear separation trends for C2H6/C2H4. The IAST selectivity is as high as 2.15 at 298&#8197;K. More importantly, dynamic breakthrough experiments have demonstrated that MTHOF&#8208;1 can effectively separate the C2H6/C2H4 feed gas to obtain polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 in one step even under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Repaired g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets: Elevating the Efficacy of Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Through Enhanced Charge Carrier Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant number of structural defects are the primary factor limiting the catalytic performance of g&#8208;C3N4. Here, a reduction in bulk defects within g&#8208;C3N4 is achieved by optimizing the mass transfer process in the synthesis pathway, resulting in enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) through facilitated charge carrier migration.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has garnered growing interest owing to its high tissue penetration depth and minimal side effects. However, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers remains the primary limiting factor for the clinical application of this treatment method. Here, defect&#8208;repaired graphene phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) nanosheets are prepared and utilized for enhanced SDT in anti&#8208;tumor treatment. After defect engineering optimization, the bulk defects of g&#8208;C3N4 are significantly reduced, resulting in higher crystallinity and exhibiting a polyheptazine imide (PHI) structure. Due to the more extended conjugated structure of PHI, facilitating faster charge transfer on the surface, it exhibits superior SDT performance for inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. This work focuses on introducing a novel carbon nitride nanomaterial as a sonosensitizer and a strategy for optimizing sonosensitizer performance by reducing bulk defects.

         <title>Precisely Patterned Channels in a Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor with a Diazirine Photo&#8208;Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted interest in the field of neuromorphic devices and implantable electronics due to their excellent characteristics. Here, we use small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinkers double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirine (DtFDA) to precisely pattern the channel layer and modulate ion transport in OECTs to fabricate high&#8208;performance vertical electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) rely on both efficient ionic doping/de&#8208;doping process and carrier transport in the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic channel under the modulation of gate bias. Moreover, channels that hold photopatterning capability are highly desired to minimize parasitic capacitance and simplify the fabrication process/cost. However, yielding photo&#8208;patternable channels with both precise/robust patterning capability and controllable ionic&#8208;electronic coupling is still challenging. Herein, double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirines (DtFDA) with different chain lengths are introduced in the OECT channel to act as both photo&#8208;crosslinker and medium to regulate ionic&#8208;electronic transport. Specifically, high&#8208;resolution patterns with a minimum line width/gap of 2&#8197;&#956;m are realized in p(g2T&#8208;T) or Homo&#8208;gDPP based channels by introducing DtFDA. Maximum transconductances of 68.6&#8197;mS and 81.6&#8197;mS, current on/off ratio of 106 and 107 (under a drain voltage of only &#177;0.1&#8197;V), are achieved in p&#8208; and n&#8208;type vertical OECTs (vOECTs), respectively, along with current densities exceeding 1&#8197;kA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles (2000&#8197;seconds). This work provides a new and facile strategy for the fabrication of vOECT channels with high resolution and high performance via the introduction of a simple and efficient crosslinker.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;Automated, High&#8208;Throughput Approach for the Synthesis and Identification of Highly Photo&#8208;Cytotoxic Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 90 iridium(III) complexes has been obtained via a combinatorial synthetic approach. The biophysical and cellular properties of the compounds have been studied using automated workflows, allowing us to identify compounds that are well tolerated in the dark but display nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. DFT calculations have been used to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data.







Abstract
The discovery of new compounds with pharmacological properties is usually a lengthy, laborious and expensive process. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing workflows that allow for the rapid synthesis and evaluation of libraries of compounds with the aim of identifying leads for further drug development. Herein, we apply combinatorial synthesis to build a library of 90&#8197;iridium(III) complexes (81 of which are new) over two synthesise&#8208;and&#8208;test cycles, with the aim of identifying potential agents for photodynamic therapy. We demonstrate the power of this approach by identifying highly active complexes that are well&#8208;tolerated in the dark but display very low nM phototoxicity against cancer cells. To build a detailed structure&#8211;activity relationship for this class of compounds we have used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine some key electronic parameters and study correlations with the experimental data. Finally, we present an optimised semi&#8208;automated synthesise&#8208;and&#8208;test protocol to obtain multiplex data within 72&#8197;hours.

         <title>Hierarchically Responsive Alternating Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Tailored Interparticle Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the self&#8208;assembly of binary inorganic NPs into hierarchically pH&#8208;responsive alternating copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures with tailored interaction &#8220;bonds&#8221;. The &#8220;bond&#8221; length (i.e., the interparticle distance), and &#8220;bond&#8221; breakage and reformation can be precisely yet reversibly controlled by adjusting the pH of the solution. This enables us to reversibly tune the structures and optical response of the copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is an essential tool for constructing structured materials with a wide range of applications. However, achieving ordered assembly structures with externally programmable properties in binary NP systems remains challenging. In this work, we assemble binary inorganic NPs into hierarchically pH&#8208;responsive alternating copolymer&#8208;like nanostructures in an aqueous medium by engineering the interparticle electrostatic interactions. The polymer&#8208;grafted NPs bearing opposite charges are viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;), and copolymerized into alternating nano&#8208;copolymers (ANCPs) driven by the formation of interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221; between nanomers. The resulting ANCPs exhibit reversibly responsive &#8220;bond&#8221; length (i.e., the distance between nanomers) in response to the variation of pH in a range of ~7&#8211;10, allowing precise control over the surface plasmon resonance of ANCPs. Moreover, specific interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221; can break up at pH&#8805;11, leading to the dis&#8208;assembly of ANCPs into molecule&#8208;like dimers and trimers. These dimeric and trimeric structures can reassemble to form ANCPs owing to the resuming of interparticle &#8220;bonds&#8221;, when the pH value of the solution changes from 11 to 7. The hierarchically responsive nanostructures may find applications in such as biosensing, optical waveguide, and electronic devices.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Organogold(III) Complexes Enable High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, based on a through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer motif have been developed to simultaneously exhibit high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. The resulting scintillator screen based on Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 achieves an optimal combination of ultrahigh light yield of 77,600 photons MeV&#8722;1, favorable X&#8208;ray stability, and excellent X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of exceeding 16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Organic scintillators have recently attracted growing attention for X&#8208;ray detection in industrial and medical applications. However, these materials still face critical obstacles of low attenuation efficiency and/or inefficient triplet exciton utilization. Here we developed a new category of organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, through adopting a through&#8208;space interaction motif to realize high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. Thanks to the efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer process, this panel of complexes achieved higher photoluminescence quantum yield and shorter radiative lifetimes compared with the through&#8208;bond reference complexes. Inspiringly, these organogold(III) complexes exhibited polarity&#8208;dependent emission origins: thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 manifested intense radioluminescence together with a record&#8208;high scintillation light yield of 77,600&#8197;photons&#8201;MeV&#8722;1 for organic scintillators. The resulting scintillator screens demonstrated high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with &gt;16.0&#8197;line&#8201;pairs&#8201;mm&#8722;1 spatial resolution, outstripping most organic and inorganic scintillators. This finding provides a feasible strategy for the design of superior organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Hetero[9]helicene Toward Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes BN[9]H have been synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step approach. The intrinsic helical structure and its multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence endows it with outstanding chiroptical properties. Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with M&#8208;/P&#8208;BN[9]H used as emitters exhibit a high EQEmax of 35.5&#8201;% and intense circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with a |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
The intrinsic helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton makes helicenes highly promising for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). Generally, carbon helicenes undergo low external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the incorporation of a multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) BN structure has led to an improvement. However, the reported B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes all show low electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), typically around 1&#215;10&#8722;3. Therefore, the development of B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes with both a high EQE and gEL value is crucial for achieving highly efficient CPEL. Herein, a facile approach to synthesize B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes, BN[9]H, is presented. BN[9]H shows a bright photoluminescence with a maximum at 578&#8197;nm with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 5.8&#215;10&#8722;3, attributed to its inherited MR&#8208;TADF property and intrinsic helical skeleton. Furthermore, circularly polarized OLED devices incorporating BN[9]H as an emitter show a maximum EQE of 35.5&#8201;%, a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm, and, more importantly, a high |gEL| value of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3. The Q&#8208;factor (|EQE&#215;gEL|) of CP&#8208;OLEDs is determined to be 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.

The Q-factor (|EQE&#215;g&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;|) of CP-OLEDs is determined to be 2.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Improbable Rotaxanes with All&#8208;Benzene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isolable azo&#8208;linked pre&#8208;rotaxane serves as the core building block for modular rotaxane synthesis. By iterative module connections followed by traceless removal of the azo linkers, [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes composed of all&#8208;benzene scaffolds have been synthesized and characterized.







Abstract
&#8220;Improbable&#8221; rotaxanes consisting of interlocked conjugated components represent non&#8208;trivial synthetic targets, not to mention those with all&#8208;benzene scaffolds. Herein, a modular synthetic strategy has been established using an isolable azo&#8208;linked pre&#8208;rotaxane as the core module, in which the azo group functions as a tracelessly removable template to direct mechanical bond formations. Through versatile connections of the pre&#8208;rotaxane and other customizable modules, [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes derived from all&#8208;benzene scaffolds have been accomplished, demonstrating the utility and potential of the synthetic design for all&#8208;benzene interlocked supramolecules.

         <title>Portably and Visually Sensing Cytisine through Smartphone Scanning Based on a Post&#8208;Modified Luminescence Center Strategy in Zinc&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emissive luminescent sensor Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 was synthesized by immobilizing Tb3+ in a new metal&#8211;organic framework, which showed high sensitivity and selectivity for cytisine in the luminescence detection. After fabricating Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 as a membrane sensor, M&#8722;Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 exhibited a luminescent color change during cytisine detection. This visual change, recognizable by smartphone scanning, enables portable detection of cytisine.







Abstract
Cytisine (CTS) is a useful medicine for treating nervous disorders and smoking addiction, and exploring a convenient method to detect CTS is of great significance for long&#8208;term/home medication to avoid the risk of poisoning, but it is full of challenges. Here, a modified metal&#8211;organic framework sensor Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 with dual emission centers was prepared using a post&#8208;modified luminescence center strategy. The obtained Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 can serve as a CTS sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity. To achieve portable detection, Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 was further fabricated as a membrane sensor, M&#8722;Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80, which displayed an obvious CTS&#8208;responsive color change by simply dropping a CTS solution onto its surface. Benefiting from this unique functionality, M&#8722;Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 successfully realized the visual detection and quantitative monitoring of CTS in the range of 5.26&#8211;52.6&#8197;mM by simply scanning the color with a smartphone. The results of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and theoretical computation illustrated that the high sensing efficiency of Tb@Zn&#8208;TDA&#8208;80 for CTS was attributed to the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the ligand and CTS. And luminescence quenching may result from the intramolecular charge transfer. This study provides a convenient method for ensuring long&#8208;term medication safety at home.

         <title>Tailored Exfoliation of Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and CH4 Valorization Mediated by O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8208;decomposition (NID) strategy is developed to exfoliate bulk C3N4 (BCN) into oxygen&#8208;rich, porous, few&#8208;layered C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tunable thickness. The optimal fl&#8208;CN catalyst is effective not only in producing H2O2 by O2 reduction, but also in selective oxidation CH4 with O2 to C1 oxygenates with a record&#8208;high production rate of 1893&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work represents a significant advance in the synthesis and application of new C3N4&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The exfoliation of bulk C3N4 (BCN) into ultrathin layered structure is an effective strategy to boost photocatalytic efficiency by exposing interior active sites and accelerating charge separation and transportation. Herein, we report a novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8208;decomposition (NID) strategy that is effective in peeling off BCN into few&#8208;layer C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tailored thickness down to bi&#8208;layer. This strategy only involves hydrothermal treatment of BCN in diluted HNO3 aqueous solution, followed by pyrolysis at various temperatures. The decomposition of the nitrate anions not only exfoliates BCN and changes the band structure, but also incorporates oxygen species onto fl&#8208;CN, which is conducive to O2 adsorption and hence relevant chemical processes. In photocatalytic O2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the H2O2 production rate over the optimal fl&#8208;CN&#8208;530 catalyst is 952&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 8.8&#8197;times that over BCN. More importantly, under full arc irradiation and in the absence of hole scavenger, CH4 can be photocatalytically oxidized by on&#8208;site formed H2O2 and active oxygen species to generate value&#8208;added C1 oxygenates with high selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% and record&#8208;high production rate of 1893&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 among the metal&#8208;free C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>MXene&#8208;mediated Interfacial Growth of 2D&#8208;2D Heterostructured Nanomaterials as Cathodes for Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the MXene&#8208;mediated interfacial growth of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructured nanomaterials. Benefitting from the synergistic effects and interfacial interactions, 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures achieved outstanding structural stability and chemical reversibility in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene heterostructures featuring a sandwiched and cross&#8208;linked network structure. This method addresses the common issue of activity degradation in 2D nanomaterials caused by inevitable aggregation. By utilizing the distinct surface characteristics of MXene, we successfully induced the growth of various 2D nanomaterials on MXene substrates. This strategy effectively mitigates self&#8208;stacking defects and augments the exposure of surface areas. In particular, the obtained 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures exhibit enhanced structural stability, improved chemical reversibility, and heightened charge transfer efficiency, outperforming pure NiCo LDH. The aqueous MH&#8722;Ni4Co1//Zn@carbon cloth (MH&#8722;Ni4Co1//Zn@CC) battery demonstrates exceptional performance with a remarkable specific capacity of 0.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining 96.6&#8201;% capacitance after 2300&#8197;cycles. Additionally, it achieves an energy density of 1.047&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 32.899&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research not only paves the way for new design paradigms in energy&#8208;related nanomaterials but also offers invaluable insights for the application and optimization of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures in advanced electrochemical devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing two-dimensional (2D) MXene heterostructures featuring a sandwiched and cross-linked network structure. This method addresses the common issue of activity degradation in 2D nanomaterials caused by inevitable aggregation. By utilizing the distinct surface characteristics of MXene, we successfully induced the growth of various 2D nanomaterials on MXene substrates. This strategy effectively mitigates self-stacking defects and augments the exposure of surface areas. In particular, the obtained 2D-2D MXene@NiCo-layered double hydroxide (MH&#8722;NiCo) heterostructures exhibit enhanced structural stability, improved chemical reversibility, and heightened charge transfer efficiency, outperforming pure NiCo LDH. The aqueous MH&#8722;Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;//Zn@carbon cloth (MH&#8722;Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;//Zn@CC) battery demonstrates exceptional performance with a remarkable specific capacity of 0.61&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, maintaining 96.6&#8201;% capacitance after 2300&#8197;cycles. Additionally, it achieves an energy density of 1.047&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a power density of 32.899&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This research not only paves the way for new design paradigms in energy-related nanomaterials but also offers invaluable insights for the application and optimization of 2D-2D heterostructures in advanced electrochemical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Cu Plates with Steady Fluid Fields for High&#8208;rate Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia and Efficient Zn&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas in a microfluid flow cell to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8722;RR setup provided superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis, and could be extended to assemble efficient Zn&#8208;nitrate batteries.







Abstract
Nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) provides a promising strategy for nitrogen utilization, while achieving high selectivity and durability at an industrial scale has remained challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that the performance of eNO3&#8722;RR could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8722;RR setup provided superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99&#8201;%, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis for 120&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record&#8208;high yield rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the proposed strategy was successfully extended to the Zn&#8208;nitrate battery system, providing a power density of 12.09&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 FE of 85.4&#8201;%, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eNO3&#8722;RR catalysts. Coupled with the COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ infrared spectroscopy, the main contributor for the high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production could be the steady fluid field to timely rejuvenate the electrocatalyst surface during the electrocatalysis.

         <title>A Powerful Strategy for Synthesizing Block Copolymers via Bimetallic Synergistic Catalysis</title>

A powerful strategy for efficiently constructing block copolymers, comprising polyacrylate&#8208; and epoxide&#8208;derived polymer segments, via a bimetallic synergistic catalysis. The high compatibility with a wide range of monomers enables the synthesis of block copolymers with diverse structures.







Abstract
Block copolymers, comprising polyether and polyolefin segments, are an important and promising category of functional materials. However, the lack of efficient strategies for the construction of polyether&#8208;b&#8208;polyolefin block copolymers have hindered the development of these materials. Herein, we propose a simple and efficient method to obtain various block copolymers through the copolymerization of epoxides and acrylates via bimetallic synergistic catalysis. The copolymerization of epoxides and acrylates proceeds in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner, where the epoxides&#8208;involved homo&#8208; or copolymerization occurs first, followed by the homopolymerization of acrylates initiated by the alkoxide species from the propagating polymer chain, thus yielding copolymers with a block structure. Notably, the high monomer compatibility of this powerful strategy provides a platform for synthesizing various polyacrylate&#8208;based block copolymers comprising polyether, polycarbonate, polythiocarbonate, polyester, and polyurethane segments, respectively.

         <title>Molecular Twist&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization and Valence Tautomeric Transitions in a Cobalt&#8208;Dioxolene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;activated molecular twist&#8208;induced unconventional trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis structural transformation is realized in the solid state, and consequent one&#8208;step&#8208;to&#8208;two&#8208;step transitions of valence tautomeric behaviors are observed.







Abstract
A mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) complex, [Co(pycz)2(Sq)(Cat)] (1&#8208;trans), where pycz = 9&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, Sq&#8901;&#8722; = 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;semiquinonato, and Cat2&#8722; = 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;catecholato, is synthesized in the trans configuration, which undergoes one&#8208;step valence tautomeric transition above room temperature. Remarkably, 1&#8208;trans can transform into its isomeric structure, [Co(pycz)2(Sq)(Sq)] (1&#8208;cis), at temperature above 350&#8197;K in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal way by in situ molecular twist, and the resulting 1&#8208;cis exhibits a pronounced two&#8208;step VT transition during magnetic measurements that is rare for mononuclear VT complexes. Such drastic solid&#8208;state structural transformation is reported in VT compounds for the first time, which is actuated by a crystal surface's melting&#8208;recrystallization induced phase transition process. DFT calculations offer an underlying mechanism suggesting a concerted bond rotation during the structural transformation. The results demonstrate an unconventional approach that realizes structural transformation of VT complexes and the control of VT performance.

         <title>A Versatile Thioesterase Involved in Dimerization during Cinnamoyl Lipid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile &#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) ysfF encodes YsfF and a nested YsfFHBT. The 4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme domain in YsfF and YsfFHBT could accomplish the ring&#8208;closure reaction for benzyl ring formation. Notably, YsfF and YsfX together are responsible for ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatizing dimerization. Furthermore, Asn301, Glu483, and His566 were found to be active&#8208;site residues for both activities.







Abstract
The cinnamoyl lipid compound youssoufene A1 (1), featuring a unique dearomatic carbon&#8208;bridged dimeric skeleton, exhibits increased inhibition against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis as compared to monomeric youssoufenes. However, the formation process of this intriguing dearomatization/dimerization remains unknown. In this study, an unusual &#8220;gene&#8208;within&#8208;gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) gene ysfF was functionally characterized. The gene was found to naturally encodes two proteins, an entire YsfF with &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolase and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoyl&#8208;CoA thioesterase (4&#8208;HBT)&#8208;like enzyme domains, and a nested YsfFHBT (4&#8208;HBT&#8208;like enzyme). Using an intracellular tagged carrier&#8208;protein tracking (ITCT) strategy, in vitro reconstitution and in vivo experiments, we found that: i) both domains of YsfF displayed thioesterase activities; ii) YsfF/YsfFHBT could accomplish the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure for benzene ring formation; and iii) YsfF and cyclase YsfX together were responsible for the ACP&#8208;tethered dearomatization/dimerization process, possibly through an unprecedented Michael&#8208;type addition reaction. Moreover, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that N301, E483 and H566 of YsfF are critical residues for both the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and dimerization processes. This study enhances our understanding of the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile &#8220;gene-within-gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) &lt;i&gt;ysfF&lt;/i&gt; encodes YsfF and a nested YsfF&lt;sub&gt;HBT&lt;/sub&gt;. The 4-HBT-like enzyme domain in YsfF and YsfF&lt;sub&gt;HBT&lt;/sub&gt; could accomplish the ring-closure reaction for benzyl ring formation. Notably, YsfF and YsfX together are responsible for ACP-tethered dearomatizing dimerization. Furthermore, Asn301, Glu483, and His566 were found to be active-site residues for both activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cinnamoyl lipid compound youssoufene A1 (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), featuring a unique dearomatic carbon-bridged dimeric skeleton, exhibits increased inhibition against multidrug resistant &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; as compared to monomeric youssoufenes. However, the formation process of this intriguing dearomatization/dimerization remains unknown. In this study, an unusual &#8220;gene-within-gene&#8221; thioesterase (TE) gene &lt;i&gt;ysfF&lt;/i&gt; was functionally characterized. The gene was found to naturally encodes two proteins, an entire YsfF with &#945;/&#946;-hydrolase and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase (4-HBT)-like enzyme domains, and a nested YsfF&lt;sub&gt;HBT&lt;/sub&gt; (4-HBT-like enzyme). Using an intracellular tagged carrier-protein tracking (ITCT) strategy, in vitro reconstitution and in vivo experiments, we found that: i) both domains of YsfF displayed thioesterase activities; ii) YsfF/YsfF&lt;sub&gt;HBT&lt;/sub&gt; could accomplish the 6&#960;-electrocyclic ring closure for benzene ring formation; and iii) YsfF and cyclase YsfX together were responsible for the ACP-tethered dearomatization/dimerization process, possibly through an unprecedented Michael-type addition reaction. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that N301, E483 and H566 of YsfF are critical residues for both the 6&#960;-electrocyclization and dimerization processes. This study enhances our understanding of the multifunctionality of the TE protein family.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarized Ultrathin BN Induced Dynamic Electron Interactions for Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice&#8208;matched interface between defect&#8208;rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) and RuO2 is ingeniously constructed to achieve robust acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability, due to the directional electron transfer of interface from B and N vacancies to RuO2.







Abstract
Developing ruthenium&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with an efficient and stable interface is essential for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheet support with relatively independent electron donor and acceptor sites, which serves as an electron reservoir and receiving station for RuO2, realizing the rapid supply and reception of electrons. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a low OER overpotential of only 180&#8197;mV (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term operational stability (350&#8197;h) are achieved, suggesting potential practical applications. In&#8197;situ characterization and theoretical calculations have validated the existence of a localized electronic recycling between RuO2 and ultrathin BN nanosheets (BNNS). The electron&#8208;rich Ru sites accelerate the adsorption of water molecules and the dissociation of intermediates, while the interconnection between the O&#8208;terminal and B&#8208;terminal edge establishes electronic back&#8208;donation, effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of lattice oxygen. This study provides a new perspective for constructing a stable and highly active catalytic interface.

         <title>Orienting Group Directed Cascade Borylation for Efficient One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as Narrowband Organic Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were synthesized from triarylamines by orienting group directed regioselective one&#8208;shot cascade borylation. The facile and scalable method enabled sustainable production of diverse organic emitting materials exhibiting narrowband emission. OLEDs based on the emitters showed high color purity in blue and green region with high external quantum efficiencies up to 40.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have emerged as very promising emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrowband emission spectra that may find application in high&#8208;definition displays. While considerable research has focused on investigating the properties of these materials, less attention has been placed on their synthetic methodology. Here we developed an efficient synthetic method for 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs, which enables sustainable production of narrowband organic emitting materials. By strategically introducing substituents, such as methyl, tert&#8208;butyl, phenyl, and chloride, at the C5 position of the 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine substrates, we achieved remarkable regioselective borylation in the para&#8208;position of the substituted moiety. This approach facilitated the synthesis of a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs emitters with good yields and exceptional regioselectivity. The synthetic method demonstrated excellent scalability for large&#8208;scale production and enabled late&#8208;stage transformation of the borylated products. Mechanistic investigations provided valuable insights into the pivotal roles of electron effect and steric hindrance effect in achieving highly efficient regioselective borylation. Moreover, the outstanding device performance of the synthesized compounds 10&#8201;b and 6&#8201;z, underscores the practicality and significance of the developed method.

         <title>Diphosphine&#8208;Protected IrAu12 Superatom with Open Site(s): Synthesis and Programmed Stepwise Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Alkynyl ligands on IrAu12 superatom were removed stepwise by a control amount of strong acid. Partially exposed IrAu12 superatoms were efficiently linked by diisocyanide, leading to selective formation of the dimer and trimer.







Abstract
One or two phenylacetylide (PA) ligand(s) were successfully removed from the IrAu12 superatomic core of [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)2]+ (dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) by reaction with controlled amounts of tetrafluoroboric acid. Optical and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations revealed the formation of open Au site(s) on the IrAu12 core of [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)1]2+ and [IrAu12(dppe)5]3+ with the remaining structure intact. Isocyanide was efficiently trapped at the open electrophilic site on [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)1]2+, whereas a dimer or trimer of the IrAu12 superatoms was formed using diisocyanide as a linker. These results open the door to designed assembly of chemically modified metal superatoms.

         <title>Effect of Intrinsic Ferroelectric Phase Transition on Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the effect of intrinsic ferroelectric (FE)&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric (PE) phase transition on electrocatalytic HER activity is studied using 2D CuInP2S6 nanosheet. Combining the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the regulated electrocatalytic activity is demonstrate, in which a clear discontinuity on overpotential and apparent activation energy values is directly observed by the corresponding FE&#8208;to&#8208;PE phase transition over 2D CuInP2S6 around the Tc point (318&#8197;K).







Abstract
Heterogeneous electrocatalysis closely relies on the electronic structure of the catalytic materials. The ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition of the materials also involves a change in the state of electrons that could impact the electrocatalytic activity, but such correlation remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity could be regulated as exampled by hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis over two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric CuInP2S6. The obvious discontinuity in the overpotential and apparent activation energy values for CuInP2S6 electrode are illustrated during the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition caused by copper displacement around Tc point (318&#8197;K), revealing the ferroelectro&#8208;catalytic effect on thermodynamics and kinetics of electrocatalysis. When loading Pt single atom on the CuInP2S6, the paraelectric phase one showed an improved hydrogen evolution activity with smaller apparent activation energy over the ferroelectric phase counterpart. This is attributed to the copper hopping between two sulfur planes, which alternate between strong and weak H adsorption at the Pt sites to simultaneously promote H+ reactant adsorption and H2 product desorption.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; point (318&#8197;K), revealing the ferroelectro-catalytic effect on thermodynamics and kinetics of electrocatalysis. When loading Pt single atom on the CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the paraelectric phase one showed an improved hydrogen evolution activity with smaller apparent activation energy over the ferroelectric phase counterpart. This is attributed to the copper hopping between two sulfur planes, which alternate between strong and weak H adsorption at the Pt sites to simultaneously promote H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reactant adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; product desorption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rationally Designed Cyclooctatetrathiophene&#8208;Based Porous Aromatic Frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

         <dc:description>
The rational design of cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) that considers the directions of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, the charge transfer position and the O2 adsorption sites provides feasible access for the construction of efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway.







Abstract
Constructing stable and efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production is of great importance and is challenging. In this study, the synthesis of three photoactive cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh)&#8208;based porous aromatic frameworks (COTh&#8208;PAFs) in an alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) fashion is presented. In combination with a triazine&#8208;derived electron acceptor, PAF&#8208;363 exhibits high efficiency for the photosynthesis of H2O2 with production rates of 11733&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1(with sacrificial agent) and 3930&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (without sacrificial agent) from water and oxygen under visible light irradiation. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the charge transfer positions and the O2 adsorption sites in PAF&#8208;363 are both concentrated on COTh fragments, which facilitate the H2O2 production through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. This work highlights that the rational design of COTh&#8208;PAFs with consideration of D&#8722;A direction, charge transfer positions, and O2 adsorption sites provides a feasible access to efficient H2O2 production photocatalysts.

         <title>Selective Construction and Structural Transformation of Homogeneous Linear Metalla[4]catenane and Metalla[2]catenane Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane consisting of four linked rings was obtained in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear Cp*Rh&#8208;based precursor.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules has been extensively researched, selectively constructing homogeneous linear [4]catenanes remains a formidable challenge. Here, we selectively constructed a homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear half&#8208;sandwich rhodium precursor. The formation of metalla[4]catenanes was facilitated by cooperative interactions between strong sandwich&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds between the components. Moreover, by modulating the aromatic substituents on the binuclear precursor, two homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes were obtained. The molecular structures of these metallacatenanes were unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, reversible structural transformation between metal&#8208;catenanes and the corresponding metallarectangles could be achieved by altering their concentration, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy studies.

         <title>Highly Conductive Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains as Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains efficiently dissociate Li salts and transport Li+ for the durable operation of Li metal full cells.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are often used for Li+ conduction as they can dissociate the Li salts efficiently. However, high entanglement of the chains and lack of pathways for rapid ion diffusion limit their applications in advanced batteries. Recent developments in ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) showed that their highly ordered structures provide efficient pathways for Li+ transport, solving the limitations of traditional PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Here, we present imidazolate COFs, PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, having methoxyethoxy chains, synthesized by Debus&#8211;Radziszewski multicomponent reactions and their ionized form, Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, showing a high Li+ conductivity of 8.81&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a transference number of 0.974. The mechanism for such excellent electrochemical properties is that methoxyethoxy chains dissociate LiClO4, making free Li+, then those Li+ are transported through the imidazolate COFs&#8217; pores. The synthesized Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs formed a stable interface with Li metal. Thus, employing Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs as the solid electrolyte to assemble LiFePO4 batteries showed an initial discharge capacity of 119.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C, and 82.0&#8201;% capacity and 99.9&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency were maintained after 400&#8197;cycles. These results show that iCOFs with ether chains synthesized via multicomponent reactions can create a new chapter for making solid electrolytes for advanced rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Activation of Ga Liquid Catalyst with Continuously Exposed Active Sites for Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and N2 to generate urea was successfully achieved by synthesising a new carbon&#8208;coated liquid alloy, Ga79Cu11Mo10@C, in which the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the active sites of Ga. Its flowability allows continuous exposure of the internal high&#8208;density active sites, while the deformability enhances the stability and toxicity resistance of the catalyst.







Abstract
Environmentally friendly electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and N2 for urea synthesis is a promising strategy. However, it is still facing problems such as low yield as well as low stability. Here, a new carbon&#8208;coated liquid alloy catalyst, Ga79Cu11Mo10@C is designed for efficient electrochemical urea synthesis by activating Ga active sites. During the N2 and CO2 co&#8208;reduction process, the yield of urea reaches 28.25&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is the highest yield reported so far under the same conditions, the Faraday efficiency (FE) is also as high as 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent stability under 100&#8197;h of testing. Comprehensive analyses showed that sequential exposure of a high density of active sites promoted the adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 for efficient coupling reactions. This coupling reaction occurs through a thermodynamic spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO to form a C&#8722;N bond. The deformability of the liquid state facilitates catalyst recovery and enhances stability and resistance to poisoning. Moreover, the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the Ga active sites, which successfully synthesises the *NCON* intermediate. The reaction energy barrier of the third proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) *NHCONH&#8594;*NHCONH2 was lowered, ensuring the efficient synthesis of urea.

During the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; co-reduction process, the yield of urea reaches 28.25&#8197;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the highest yield reported so far under the same conditions, the Faraday efficiency (FE) is also as high as 60.6&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent stability under 100&#8197;h of testing. Comprehensive analyses showed that sequential exposure of a high density of active sites promoted the adsorption and activation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for efficient coupling reactions. This coupling reaction occurs through a thermodynamic spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO to form a C&#8722;N bond. The deformability of the liquid state facilitates catalyst recovery and enhances stability and resistance to poisoning. Moreover, the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the Ga active sites, which successfully synthesises the *NCON* intermediate. The reaction energy barrier of the third proton-coupled electron transfer process rate-determining step (RDS) *NHCONH&#8594;*NHCONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was lowered, ensuring the efficient synthesis of urea.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Compatible Gel&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by NaF&#8208;Solubility&#8208;Regulation toward All&#8208;Climate Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>

In the designed &#8220;salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer&#8221; gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte, dissolved NaF salt occupies free solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment and added aggregates, which induced stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. It delivers enhanced Na+ transport kinetics from electrolyte to interface and high compatibility with different cathodes and anodes. The assembled solid&#8208;state Na&#8201;||&#8201;Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a pragmatic choice for high&#8208;safety sodium batteries but still plagued by interfacial compatibility with both cathode and anode simultaneously. Here, salt&#8208;in&#8208;polymer fibers with NaF salt inlaid in polylactide (PLA) fiber network was fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent in situ forming gel&#8208;polymer electrolyte in liquid electrolytes. The obtained PLA&#8208;NaF GPE achieves a high ion conductivity (2.50&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and large Na+ transference number (0.75) at ambient temperature. Notably, the dissolution of NaF salt occupies solvents leading to concentrated&#8208;electrolyte environment, which facilitates aggregates with increased anionic coordination (anion/Na+ &gt;1). Aggregates with higher HOMO realize the preferential oxidation on the cathode so that inorganic&#8208;rich and stable CEI covers cathode&#8217; surface, preventing particles&#8217; breakage and showing good compatibility with different cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2+2xFe2&#8208;x(SO4)3, Na0.72Ni0.32Mn0.68O2, NaTi2(PO4)3). While, passivated Na anode induced by the lower LUMO of aggregates, and the lower surface tension between Na anode and PLA&#8208;NaF GPE interface, leading to the dendrites&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the assembled Na&#8201;||&#8201;Na3V2(PO4)3 cells display excellent electrochemical performance at all&#8208;climate conditions.

         <title>Unlocking Amides: A General Method for the Self&#8208;Immolative Release of Amide&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methodologies for the self&#8208;immolative release of amide motifs remain scarce despite the prevalence of amides in molecules. Herein, is presented a general and comprehensive strategy for the selective release of a diverse range of amides using a range of common triggers. A stable prodrug of the FDA approved antibiotic linezolid showcased the method and exhibited selective release and equipotency to free linezolid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.







Abstract
The controlled liberation of molecules from a constructed framework is a subject of profound interest across various chemical fields. It allows for the masking of a molecule's properties and precise deployment upon a single controllable release event. While numerous methodologies have been developed for amines, alcohols, and thiols, approaches for utilising amides as payload&#8208;release handles are still in their early stages of development, despite the prevalence of amides in therapeutic compounds and materials. Herein, is presented a comprehensive strategy for the controlled and selective release of a diverse range of amides with stable linkers. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated by its successful application in the targeted release of various amide&#8208;containing drugs in their natural form via the use of commonly used trigger motifs, such as dipeptides or glycosides. As a proof of concept, the FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic linezolid has been successfully converted into a prodrug form and released selectively only in the presence of the trigger event. Significantly, in its prodrug state, no activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was exhibited. Linezolid's full potential was achieved only upon controlled release, where an equipotent efficacy to the free linezolid control was demonstrated, thus emphasising the immense potential of this method.

         <title>A Polymeric Nanoparticle to Co&#8208;Deliver Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Peptides and Pt(IV) Prodrug: Toward High Loading Efficiency and Combination Efficacy</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. Notably, the polymeric nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable combination efficacy on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model.







Abstract
Developing combination chemotherapy systems with high drug loading efficiency at predetermined drug ratios to achieve a synergistic effect is important for cancer therapy. Herein, a polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. The depolymerization of polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle and the activation of Pt prodrug can be effectively triggered by the acidic tumor environment extracellularly and the high levels of glutathione intracellularly in cancer cells, respectively. The utilization of mitochondria&#8208;targeting peptide can inhibit ATP&#8208;dependent processes including drug efflux and DNA damage repair. This leads to increased accumulation of Pt&#8208;drugs within cancer cells. Eventually, the polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable antitumor effects on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model. It is highly anticipated that the polymeric dual&#8208;or multi&#8208;drug systems can be applied for combination chemotherapy to achieve enhanced anticancer activity and reduced side effects.

         <title>Dynamic Molecular Interphases Regulated by Trace Dual Electrolyte Additives for Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid aqueous electrolyte of ZnSO4 with trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate enables ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anode by virtue of D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species alternately and reversibly adsorb on Zn surface to form dynamical molecular interphases and enter Zn2+ solvation sheath to boost de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits exceptional stability for &gt;6400&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Metallic zinc is a promising anode material for rechargeable aqueous multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries due to its high capacity and low cost. However, the practical use is always beset by severe dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions occurring at anode/electrolyte interface. Here we demonstrate dynamic molecular interphases caused by trace dual electrolyte additives of D&#8208;mannose and sodium lignosulfonate for ultralong&#8208;lifespan and dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. Triggered by plating and stripping electric fields, the D&#8208;mannose and lignosulfonate species are alternately and reversibly (de&#8208;)adsorbed on Zn metal, respectively, to accelerate Zn2+ transportation for uniform Zn nucleation and deposition and inhibit side reactions for high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, Zn anode in such dual&#8208;additive electrolyte exhibits highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating behaviors for &gt;6400&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which enables long&#8208;term cycling stability of Zn||ZnxMnO2 full cell for more than 2000&#8197;cycles.

Triggered by plating and stripping electric fields, the D-mannose and lignosulfonate species are alternately and reversibly (de-)adsorbed on Zn metal, respectively, to accelerate Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transportation for uniform Zn nucleation and deposition and inhibit side reactions for high Coulombic efficiency. As a result, Zn anode in such dual-additive electrolyte exhibits highly reversible and dendrite-free Zn stripping/plating behaviors for &amp;gt;6400&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which enables long-term cycling stability of Zn||Zn&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Boosted Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH by Rhenium Atomically Dispersed on Indium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst with atomically dispersed Re boosts selective CH3OH formation in sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2. The atomically dispersed Re is beneficial for CO2 conversion to CO which is strongly adsorbed on 2Re&#8208;In2O3 and prefers to undergo hydrogenation to CH3OH rather than desorption from 2Re&#8208;In2O3, thus boosting CH3OH formation. This opens a new way to improve sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free selective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven photoreduction of CO2 is promising in alleviating environment burden, but suffers from low efficiency and over&#8208;reliance on sacrificial agents. Herein, rhenium (Re) is atomically dispersed in In2O3 to fabricate a 2Re&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst. In sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2 with H2O, 2Re&#8208;In2O3 shows a long&#8208;term stable efficiency which is enhanced by 3.5 times than that of pure In2O3 and is also higher than those on Au&#8208;In2O3, Ag&#8208;In2O3, Cu&#8208;In2O3, Ir&#8208;In2O3, Ru&#8208;In2O3, Rh&#8208;In2O3 and Pt&#8208;In2O3 photocatalysts. Moreover, carbon&#8208;based product of the photoreduction overturns from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. Re promotes charge separation, H2O dissociation and CO2 activation, thus enhancing photoreduction efficiency of CO2 on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. During the photoreduction, CO is a key intermediate. CO prefers to desorption rather than hydrogenation on pure In2O3, as CO binds to pure In2O3 very weakly. Re strengthens the interaction of CO with 2Re&#8208;In2O3 by 5.0 times, thus limiting CO desorption but enhancing CO hydrogenation to CH3OH. This could be the origin for photoreduction product overturn from CO on pure In2O3 to CH3OH on 2Re&#8208;In2O3. The present work opens a new way to boost sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free photoreduction of CO2.

         <title>Glutathione Induced In situ Synthesis of Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Anaerobic Glycolysis Metabolism Interference for Boosting Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ synthesis strategy for Cu single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu SAzyme) was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8722;O2/Cu&#8722;O4). The in situ activation process specifically disturbed copper metabolism pathway, thereby leading to enhanced copper deposition in cytoplasm for boosted cuproptosis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) has sparked increasing interest for catalytic antitumor treatment due to their more tunable and diverse active sites than natural metalloenzymes in complex physiological conditions. However, it is usually a hard task to precisely conduct catalysis at tumor sites after intravenous injection of those SAzyme with high reactivity. Moreover, the explorations of SAzymes in the anticancer application are still in its infancy and need to be developed. Herein, an in situ synthesis strategy for Cu SAzyme was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8722;O2/Cu&#8722;O4) via GSH&#8208;responsive deformability of supports. Our results suggest that the in situ activation process could further facilitate the dissociation of copper ions and the consumption of glutathione, thereby leading to copper deposition in cytoplasm and triggering cuproptosis. Moreover, the in situ synthesis of Cu SAzyme with peroxidase&#8208;like activity enabled the intracellular reactive oxygen species production, resulting in specifically disturbance of copper metabolism pathway. Meanwhile, the in situ exposed glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor phloretin (Ph) can block the glycose uptake to boost cuproptosis efficacy. Overall, this in situ activation strategy effectively diminished the off&#8208;target effects of SACs&#8208;induced catalytic therapies and introduced a promising treatment paradigm for advancing cuproptosis&#8208;associated therapies.

         <title>Modular Weaving DNAzyme in Skeleton of DNA Nanocages for Photoactivatable Catalytic Activity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach is established for spatiotemporal control of DNAzyme&#8208;based gene regulation activity through modular weaving active DNAzyme into skeleton of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (TDN). The direct encoding of DNAzyme in TDN not only improves biostability and delivery efficiency, but also allows spatiotemporal control of their catalytic activity.







Abstract
DNAzymes exhibit tremendous application potentials in the field of biosensing and gene regulation due to its unique catalytic function. However, spatiotemporally controlled regulation of DNAzyme activity remains a daunting challenge, which may cause nonspecific signal leakage or gene silencing of the catalytic systems. Here, we report a photochemical approach via modular weaving active DNAzyme into the skeleton of tetrahedral DNA nanocages (TDN) for light&#8208;triggered on&#8208;demand liberation of DNAzyme and thus conditional control of gene regulation activity. We demonstrate that the direct encoding of DNAzyme in TDN could improve the biostability of DNAzyme and ensure the delivery efficiency, comparing with the conventional surface anchoring strategy. Furthermore, the molecular weaving of the DNA nanostructures allows remote control of DNAzyme&#8208;mediated gene regulation with high spatiotemporal precision of light. In addition, we demonstrate that the approach is applicable for controlled regulation of the gene editing functions of other functional nucleic acids.

         <title>Second Generation Catalytic Enantioselective Nucleophilic Desymmetrization at Phosphorus (V): Improved Generality, Efficiency and Modularity</title>

A second&#8208;generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates.







Abstract
A broadly improved second generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds is described. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a wide range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) containing compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates. A new ureidopeptide BIMP catalyst/thiaziolidinone leaving group combination allowed for a far wider substrate scope and increased reaction efficiency and practicality over previously established protocols. The resulting enantioenriched intermediates could then be transformed into an even greater range of distinct classes of P(V) compounds by displacement of the remaining leaving group as well as allowing for even further diversification downstream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to pinpoint the origin of enantioselectivity for the BIMP&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization, to rationalize how a superior catalyst/leaving group combination leads to increased generality in our second&#8208;generation catalytic system, as well as shed light onto observed stereochemical retention and inversion pathways when performing late&#8208;stage enantiospecific SN2@P reactions with Grignard reagents.

&lt;p&gt;A second-generation catalytic two-phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a range of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;- substituted P(V) compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broadly improved second generation catalytic two-phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of stereogenic at phosphorus (V) compounds is described. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a wide range of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;- substituted P(V) containing compounds from a handful of enantioenriched intermediates. A new ureidopeptide BIMP catalyst/thiaziolidinone leaving group combination allowed for a far wider substrate scope and increased reaction efficiency and practicality over previously established protocols. The resulting enantioenriched intermediates could then be transformed into an even greater range of distinct classes of P(V) compounds by displacement of the remaining leaving group as well as allowing for even further diversification downstream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to pinpoint the origin of enantioselectivity for the BIMP-catalyzed desymmetrization, to rationalize how a superior catalyst/leaving group combination leads to increased generality in our second-generation catalytic system, as well as shed light onto observed stereochemical retention and inversion pathways when performing late-stage enantiospecific S&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Asymmetric Backbone for Highly Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.7&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules, namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.7&#8201;%, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient.







Abstract
The hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), poly (3,4&#8208;ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), is the most widely used material in the realization of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the stability of PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS&#8208;based OSCs is quite poor, arising from its strong acidity and hygroscopicity. In addition, PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS has an absorption in the infrared region and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, thus limiting the enhancement of short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. Herein, two asymmetric self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs), namely BrCz and BrBACz, were designed and synthesized as HTM in binary OSCs based on the well&#8208;known system of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO, and D18&#8201;:&#8201;eC9. Compared with BrCz, BrBACz shows larger dipole moment, deeper work function and lower surface energy. Moreover, BrBACz not only enhances photon harvesting in the active layer, but also minimizes voltage losses as well as improves interface charge extraction/ transport. Consequently, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;eC9&#8208;based binary OSC using BrBACz as HTM exhibits a champion efficiency of 19.70&#8201;% with a remarkable Jsc of 29.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Voc of 0.856&#8197;V, which is a record efficiency for binary OSCs so far. In addition, the unencapsulated device maintains 95.0&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1,000&#8197;hours of storage at air ambient, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Functional Selection of Tau Oligomerization&#8208;Inhibiting Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel aptamer selection method (Functional Selection) has identified a DNA aptamer, BW1c, with high specificity and affinity binding to Tau protein, representing a new avenue for inhibiting Tau protein aggregation. This strategy shows a &#8220;fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose&#8221; selection workflow for discovery of aptamers with desired functionality.







Abstract
Pathological hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule&#8208;associated Tau protein contribute to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other related tauopathies. Currently, no cure exists for Alzheimer's Disease. Aptamers offer significant potential as next&#8208;generation therapeutics in biotechnology and the treatment of neurological disorders. Traditional aptamer selection methods for Tau protein focus on binding affinity rather than interference with pathological Tau. In this study, we developed a new selection strategy to enrich DNA aptamers that bind to surviving monomeric Tau protein under conditions that would typically promote Tau aggregation. Employing this approach, we identified a set of aptamer candidates. Notably, BW1c demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd=6.6&#8197;nM) to Tau protein and effectively inhibits arachidonic acid (AA)&#8208;induced Tau protein oligomerization and aggregation. Additionally, it inhibits GSK3&#946;&#8208;mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cell&#8208;free systems and okadaic acid&#8208;mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation in cellular milieu. Lastly, retro&#8208;orbital injection of BW1c tau aptamer shows the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and gain access to neuronal cell body. Through further refinement and development, these Tau aptamers may pave the way for a first&#8208;in&#8208;class neurotherapeutic to mitigate tauopathy&#8208;associated neurodegenerative disorders.

In 1865 Johann Wilhelm Hittorf discovered violet phosphorus and it took until 1969 when Thurn and Krebs determined the structure of orthogonally arranged tubes with pentagonal cross&#8208;sections. Different to their claim, the structure determined by Zhang et&#8197;al. in 2020 depicted in orange is identical to the 1969 structure shown in green and should not be referenced as a new polymorph.

         <title>Cell Membrane as A Promising Therapeutic Target: From Materials Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, tumor cell membrane possessing the unique structure and diverse functions has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target. In this review, diverse treatments aiming at cell membrane based on functional materials are summarized and discussed, ranging from well&#8208;known photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT), in situ self&#8208;assembly/biosynthesis to newly emerged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation.







Abstract
The cell membrane is a crucial component of cells, protecting their integrity and stability while facilitating signal transduction and information exchange. Therefore, disrupting its structure or impairing its functions can potentially cause irreversible cell damage. Presently, the tumor cell membrane is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for various treatment methods. Given the extensive research focused on cell membranes, it is both necessary and timely to discuss these developments, from materials design to specific biomedical applications. This review covers treatments based on functional materials targeting the cell membrane, ranging from well&#8208;known membrane&#8208;anchoring photodynamic therapy to recent lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation. The diverse therapeutic mechanisms are introduced in the following sections: membrane&#8208;anchoring phototherapy, self&#8208;assembly on the membrane, in situ biosynthesis on the membrane, and degradation of cell membrane proteins by chimeras. In each section, we outline the conceptual design or general structure derived from numerous studies, emphasizing representative examples to understand advancements and draw inspiration. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future directions in membrane&#8208;targeted therapy from our perspective. This review aims to engage multidisciplinary readers and encourage researchers in related fields to advance the fundamental theories and practical applications of membrane&#8208;targeting therapeutic agents.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light harvesting scaffold: Pd(II)/Pt(II)&#8208;based supramolecular scaffolds are well known for providing a wide pool of discrete architectures with numerous applications in catalysis, guest encapsulation, proton conductivity, explosive detection etc. This minireview summarizes various such light harvesting metallacycles, and metallacages that have opened up a new direction in terms of their structural design as well as exciting new applications.







Abstract
The development of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems mimicking the natural photosynthesis method is an ever&#8208;growing field of research. Numerous systems such as polymers, metal complexes, POFs, COFs, supramolecular frameworks etc. have been fabricated to accomplish more efficient energy transfer and storage. Among them, the supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) formed by non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;ligand interaction, have shown the capacity to not only undergo single and multistep energy migration but also to utilize the harvested energy for a wide variety of applications such as photocatalysis, tunable emissive systems, encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, white light emitters etc. This review sheds light on the light&#8208;harvesting behavior of both the 2D metallacycles and 3D metallacages where design ingenuity has been executed to afford energy harvesting by both donor ligands as well as metal acceptors.

This minireview article highlights the role of sulfur in enhancing sustainable carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions for emerging organic synthesis goals. A unique combination of sulfur properties is emphasized for initiating radical transformations and facilitating waste&#8208;free processes, offering significant advancements and new eco&#8208;friendly synthesis directions.







Abstract
This review explores the pivotal role of sulfur in advancing sustainable carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling reactions. The unique electronic properties of sulfur, as a soft Lewis base with significant mesomeric effect make it an excellent candidate for initiating radical transformations, directing C&#8722;H&#8208;activation, and facilitating cycloaddition and C&#8722;S bond dissociation reactions. These attributes are crucial for developing waste&#8208;free methodologies in green chemistry. Our mini&#8208;review is focused on existing sulfur&#8208;directed C&#8722;C coupling techniques, emphasizing their sustainability and comparing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with traditional approaches. The review highlights the importance of this research in addressing current challenges in organic synthesis and catalysis. The innovative use of sulfur in photocatalytic, electrochemical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes not only exemplifies significant advancements in the field but also opens new avenues for environmentally friendly chemical processes. By focusing on atom economy and waste minimization, the analysis provides broad appeal and potential for future developments in sustainable organic chemistry.

         <title>Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s: Shape&#8208;Tunable Building Blocks for Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses in a comparative way the self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution of oligophenyleneethynylenes (OPEs), a class of dyes that has been widely used for various functional materials. The classification of different OPEs according to their molecular shape allows to rationalize their structure/self&#8208;assembly correlation, which should pave the way for the development of functional materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.







Abstract
Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s (OPEs) have attracted widespread attention due to their remarkable (opto)electronic and photophysical properties, which have enabled numerous applications. The versatile functionalization possibilities of OPEs make them unique candidates to form various shape&#8208;persistent geometries, including linear, triangular, rectangular, hexagonal and macrocyclic. However, as a result of this structural variety, it is oftentimes challenging to correlate molecular design with self&#8208;assembly properties. In this minireview, we have classified OPEs based on their molecular shapes and correlated them with their self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution. Particularly, we provide important insights into the aggregation propensity of the different molecular shapes and how to tune the association strength using various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Our classification will enable a better understanding of the structure&#8208;property correlation in OPEs, which is key to develop supramolecular functional materials.

&lt;p&gt;This minireview discusses in a comparative way the self-assembly behavior in solution of oligophenyleneethynylenes (OPEs), a class of dyes that has been widely used for various functional materials. The classification of different OPEs according to their molecular shape allows to rationalize their structure/self-assembly correlation, which should pave the way for the development of functional materials based on &#960;-conjugated systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s (OPEs) have attracted widespread attention due to their remarkable (opto)electronic and photophysical properties, which have enabled numerous applications. The versatile functionalization possibilities of OPEs make them unique candidates to form various shape-persistent geometries, including linear, triangular, rectangular, hexagonal and macrocyclic. However, as a result of this structural variety, it is oftentimes challenging to correlate molecular design with self-assembly properties. In this minireview, we have classified OPEs based on their molecular shapes and correlated them with their self-assembly behavior in solution. Particularly, we provide important insights into the aggregation propensity of the different molecular shapes and how to tune the association strength using various non-covalent interactions. Our classification will enable a better understanding of the structure-property correlation in OPEs, which is key to develop supramolecular functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Photomediated polymerizations replace traditional methods due to cost&#8208;efficiency, sustainability, and temporal control. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, specifically carbon nanomaterials (dots and nitrides), bring many advantages. They&#8242;re derived inexpensively from biomass and highly efficient in various polymerization modes. This review covers their preparation, photocatalytic properties, and use in various polymerization methods. It also discusses their applications, and future prospects and challenges.







Abstract
Carbon nanomaterials, specifically carbon dots and carbon nitrides, play a crucial role as heterogeneous photoinitiators in both radical and cationic polymerization processes. These recently introduced materials offer promising solutions to the limitations of current homogeneous systems, presenting a novel approach to photopolymerization. This review highlights the preparation and photocatalytic performance of these nanomaterials, emphasizing their application in various polymerization techniques, including photoinduced i) free radical, ii) RAFT, iii) ATRP, and iv) cationic photopolymerization. Additionally, it discusses their potential in addressing contemporary challenges and explores prospects in this field. Moreover, carbon nitrides, in particular, exhibit exceptional oxygen tolerance, underscoring their significance in radical polymerization processes and allowing their applications such as 3D printing, surface modification of coatings, and hydrogel engineering.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of Cell&#8208;Surface Proteins via Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy by Using Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular strategy for targeted degradation of cell&#8208;surface proteins with an antibody&#8211;peptide conjugate (Ab&#8208;CMA) is reported, in which a peptide targeting chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) was conjugated with commercially available antibodies for CMA&#8208;based lysosomal degradation of the corresponding antigen independent of specific cell&#8208;surface receptors or E3 ligases, with useful implications for both biochemical research and for therapeutics.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;surface proteins are important drug targets but historically have posed big challenges for the complete elimination of their functions. Herein, we report antibody&#8211;peptide conjugates (Ab&#8208;CMAs) in which a peptide targeting chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) was conjugated with commercially available monoclonal antibodies for specific cell&#8208;surface protein degradation by taking advantage of lysosomal degradation pathways. Unique features of Ab&#8208;CMAs, including cell&#8208;surface receptor&#8208; and E3 ligase&#8208;independent degradation, feasibility towards different cell&#8208;surface proteins (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand&#8197;1 (PD&#8208;L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)) by a simple change of the antibody, and successful tumor inhibition in vivo, make them attractive protein degraders for biomedical research and therapeutic applications. As the first example employing CMA to degrade proteins from the outside in, our findings may also shed new light on CMA, a degradation pathway typically targeting cytosolic proteins.

         <title>Triazine Frameworks for the Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent triazine frameworks were employed as metal&#8208;free visible light photocatalysts for the efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons under ambient conditions. The catalytic efficiency of the meticulously crafted thiophene&#8208;based CTF was remarkably similar to that of transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysts previously reported. This not only highlights the potential of CTFs but also enhances our comprehension of the mechanisms governing effective C&#8722;H activation within photocatalytic polymers.







Abstract
Investigations into the selective oxidation of inert sp3 C&#8722;H bonds using polymer photocatalysts under mild conditions have been limited. Additionally, the structure&#8208;activity relationship of photocatalysts often remains insufficiently explored. Here, a series of thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are used for the efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to aldehydes or ketones under ambient aerobic conditions. Spectroscopic methods conducted in situ and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the sulfur atoms within the thiophene units play a pivotal role as oxidation sites due to the generation of photogenerated holes. The effect of photogenerated holes on photocatalytic toluene oxidation was investigated by varying the length of the spacer in a CTF donor&#8208;acceptor based photocatalyst. Furthermore, the manipulation of reactive oxygen species was employed to enhance selectivity by weakening the peroxidative capacity. As an illustrative example, this study successfully demonstrated the synthesis of a precursor of the neurological drug AMG&#8208;579 using a photocatalytic protocol.

         <title>A Chiral B&#8722;N Adduct as a New Frontier in Ferroelectrics and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral B&#8722;N adduct [RC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (RMBA&#8208;BF3) was synthesized and found to display excellent ferroelectric polarization, as established by experimental and theoretical characterizations. Mechanical energy harvesting devices made from its as&#8208;made crystals were shown to exhibit efficient piezoelectric nanogenerator output performance.







Abstract
Within the burgeoning field of electronic materials, B&#8722;N Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, distinguished by their partial charge distribution across boron and nitrogen centers, represent an underexplored class with significant potential. These materials exhibit inherent dipoles and are excellent candidates for ferroelectricity. However, the challenge lies in achieving the optimal combination of hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base pairs to yield B&#8722;N adducts with stable dipoles. Herein, we present an enantiomeric pair of B&#8722;N adducts [R/SC6H5CH(CH3)NH2BF3] (R/SMBA&#8208;BF3) crystallizing in the polar monoclinic P21 space group. The ferroelectric measurements on RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave a rectangular P&#8208;E hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization of 7.65&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a value that aligns with the polarization derived from the extensive density&#8208;functional theory computations. The PFM studies on the drop&#8208;casted film of RMBA&#8208;BF3 further corroborate the existence of ferroelectric domains, displaying characteristic amplitude&#8208;bias butterfly and phase&#8208;bias hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric nature of the RMBA&#8208;BF3 was confirmed by its direct piezoelectric coefficient (d33) value of 3.5&#8197;pC&#8201;N&#8722;1 for its pellet. The piezoelectric energy harvesting applications on the sandwich devices fabricated from the as&#8208;made crystals of RMBA&#8208;BF3 gave an open circuit voltage (VPP) of 6.2&#8197;V. This work thus underscores the untapped potential of B&#8722;N adducts in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting.

         <title>Rechargeable Afterglow Nanotorches for In Vivo Tracing of Cell&#8208;Based Microrobots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) rechargeable nanotorch was devised for in vivo tracking of cell&#8208;based microrobots (MRs). The as&#8208;prepared nanotorch uses faPT, a methylene blue analog, as a NIR transducer, generating singlet oxygen that prompts the SA570, a modified version of Schaap's 1,2&#8208;dioxetane, to produce a 10&#8208;day&#8208;lasting afterglow. Once its glow fades, the nanotorch can be non&#8208;invasively recharged using 660&#8197;nm light, highlighting its potential for continuous in vivo MR tracking.







Abstract
As one of the self&#8208;luminescence imaging approaches that require pre&#8208;illumination instead of real&#8208;time light excitation, afterglow luminescence imaging has attracted increasing enthusiasm to circumvent tissue autofluorescence. In this work, we developed organic afterglow luminescent nanoprobe (nanotorch), which could emit persistent luminescence more than 10&#8197;days upon single light excitation. More importantly, the nanotorch could be remote charged by 660&#8197;nm light in a non&#8208;invasive manner, which showed great potential for real&#8208;time tracing the location of macrophage cell&#8208;based microrobots.

         <title>Changing Liquid Crystal Helical Pitch with a Reversible Rotaxane Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The translocation of a macrocycle relative to a point chiral center on a rotaxane axle can amplify the macroscopic expression of the molecular chirality in a soft matter system. When the macrocycle binds to a chiral amino acid on the rotaxane axle in a nematic liquid crystal doped with 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the rotaxane, the liquid crystal helix contracts to approximately 68&#8201;% of the pitch length observed when the ring is distant from the chiral center.







Abstract
The transmission of chiral information between the molecular, meso and microscopic scales is a facet of biology that remains challenging to understand mechanistically and to mimic with artificial systems. Here we demonstrate that the dynamic change in the expression of the chirality of a rotaxane can be transduced into a change in pitch of a soft matter system. Shuttling the position of the macrocycle from far&#8208;away&#8208;from to close&#8208;to a point&#8208;chiral center on the rotaxane axle changes the expression of the chiral information that is transmitted across length scales; from nanometer scale constitutional chirality that affects the conformation of the macrocycle, to the centimeter scale chirality of the liquid crystal phase, significantly changing the pitch length of the chiral nematic structure.

         <title>Overcoming Thermal Quenching in X&#8208;ray Scintillators through Multi&#8208;Excited State Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>

The ability of the hybrid perovskite TpyBiCl5 scintillator to switch between TDAF and phosphorescence modes at elevated temperatures provides an effective solution to overcome thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray scintillators have gained significant attention in medical diagnostics and industrial applications. Despite their widespread utility, scintillator development faces a significant hurdle when exposed to elevated temperatures, as it usually results in reduced scintillation efficiency and diminished luminescence output. Here we report a molecular design strategy based on a hybrid perovskite (TpyBiCl5) that overcomes thermal quenching through multi&#8208;excited state switching. The structure of perovskite provides a platform to modulate the luminescence centers. The rigid framework constructed by this perovskite structure stabilized its triplet states, resulting in TpyBiCl5 exhibiting an approximately 12&#8197;times higher (45&#8201;% vs. 3.8&#8201;%) photoluminescence quantum yield of room temperature phosphorescence than that of its organic ligand (Tpy). Most importantly, the interactions between the components of this perovskite enable the mixing of different excited states, which has been revealed by experimental and theoretical investigations. The TpyBiCl5 scintillator exhibits a detection limit of 38.92&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 213&#8197;K and a detection limit of 196.31&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 353&#8197;K through scintillation mode switching between thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence. This work opens up the possibility of solving the thermal quenching in X&#8208;ray scintillators by tuning different excited states.

         <title>Electrochemical Capacitance Traces with Interlayer Spacing in Two&#8208;dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Faradaic contributions to charge storage increase as interlayer spacing widens in a series of Ni3(HIR3&#8208;TAT)2 (R=H, Et, n&#8208;Bu, n&#8208;Pent) 2D conductive MOFs, as the charge storage mechanism shifts to adopt increasingly pseudocapacitive character. An optimum in terms of capacitance is reached, balancing faradaic contributions and resistances.







Abstract
Electrically conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for electrochemical capacitors (EC) for fast energy storage due to their high specific surface areas and potential for redox activity. To maximize energy density, traditional inorganic pseudocapacitors have utilized faradaic processes in addition to double&#8208;layer capacitance. Although conductive MOFs are usually comprised of redox active ligands which allow faradaic reactions upon electrochemical polarization, systematic studies providing deeper understanding of the charge storage processes and structure&#8208;function relationships have been scarce. Here, we investigate the charge storage mechanisms of a series of triazatruxene&#8208;based 2D layered conductive MOFs with variable alkyl functional groups, Ni3(HIR3&#8208;TAT)2 (TAT=triazatruxene; R=H, Et, n&#8208;Bu, n&#8208;Pent). Functionalization of the triazatruxene core allows for systematic variation of structural parameters while maintaining in&#8208;plane conjugation between ligands and metals. Specifically, R groups modulate interlayer spacing, which in turn shifts the charge storage mechanism from double&#8208;layer capacitance towards pseudocapacitance, leading to an increase in molar specific capacitance from Ni3(HIH3&#8208;TAT)2 to Ni3(HIBu3&#8208;TAT)2. Partial exfoliation of Ni3(HIBu3&#8208;TAT)2 renders redox active ligand moieties more accessible, and thus increases the dominance of faradaic processes. Our strategy of controlling charge storage mechanism through tuning the accessibility of redox&#8208;active sites may motivate further design and engineering of electrode materials for EC.

         <title>Expanded Azahelicenes with Large Dissymmetry Factors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 18, April 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded azahelicenes consisting of up to 43 rings are accessible by a facile synthesis. The enantiomers of the acquired azahelicenes exhibited large dissymmetry factors with up to 0.048 (gabs) and 0.021 (glum), respectively.







Abstract
Expanded azahelicenes, as heteroanalogues of helically chiral helicenes, hold significant potential for chiroptical materials. Nevertheless, their investigation and research have remained largely unexplored. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of a series of expanded azahelicenes NHn (n=1&#8211;5) consisting of 11, 19, 27, 35, and 43 fused rings, mainly by Suzuki coupling followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structures of NH2, NH3 and NH4 were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis, and their (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208; enantiomers were also isolated with chiral high performance liquid chromatography. The enantiomers exhibit large absorption (abs) and luminescence (lum) dissymmetry factors, with |gabs|max=0.044; |glum|max=0.003 for NH2, |gabs|max=0.048; |glum|=0.014 for NH3, and |gabs|max=0.043; |glum|max=0.021 for NH4, which are superior to their respective all&#8208;carbon analogues.

         <title>Engineering NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 Triple&#8208;atom Sites in Defective MOFs for Selective Overall Photoreduction of CO2 into CH3COCH3</title>

We introduced Cu2+ into the connected nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (Cu&#8208;MOF) and formed special NH2&#8208;Cu&#8208;NH2 catalytic sites for photocatalytic H2O splitting and selective CO2 reduction into acetone. Two amino groups and Cu sites synergistically captured the CO2 molecules and stabilized and decreased the activation energy barriers of the *CO, *CH3, *COCH3, and *COCOCH3 key species, which ultimately produced the C3 product. Finally, Cu&#8208;MOF efficiently converted H2O and CO2 into CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivities up to 97.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Selective photoreduction of CO2 to multicarbon products, is an important but challenging task, due to high CO2 activation barriers and insufficient catalytic sites for C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, a defect engineering strategy for incorporating copper sites into the connected nodes of defective metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 for selective overall photo&#8208;reduction of CO2 into acetone. The Cu2+ site in well&#8208;modified CuN2O2 units served as a trapping site to capture electrons via efficient electron&#8208;hole separation, forming the active Cu+ site for CO2 reduction. Two NH2 groups in CuN2O2 unit adsorb CO2 and cooperated with copper ion to functionalize as a triple atom catalytic site, each interacting with one CO2 molecule to strengthen the binding of *CO intermediate to the catalytic site. The deoxygenated *CO attached to the Cu site interacted with *CH3 fixed at one amino group to form the key intermediate CO*&#8208;CH3, which interacted with the third reduction intermediate on another amino group to produce acetone. Our photocatalyst realizes efficient overall CO2 reduction to C3 product acetone CH3COCH3 with an evolution rate of 70.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity up to 97&#8201;% without any adducts, offering a promising avenue for designing triple&#8208;atomic sites to producing C3 product from photosynthesis with water.

         <title>Probing Energy&#8208;Funneling Kinetics in Nanocrystal Sublattices for Superior X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;lasting radioluminescence scintillators have recently attracted substantial attention from both research and industrial communities, primarily due to their distinctive capabilities of converting and storing X&#8208;ray energy. However, determination of energy&#8208;conversion kinetics in these nanocrystals remaines unexplored. Here we investigate energy funneling kinetics in NaLuF4:Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystal sublattices via Gd3+&#8208;driven microenvironment engineering and Mn2+&#8208;mediated radioluminescence profiling. Our photophysical studies reveal effective control of energy&#8208;funneling kinetics and demonstrate the tunability of electron trap depth ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 eV, with the corresponding trap density varying between 2.38 &#215; 105 and 1.34 &#215; 107 cm&#8208;3. This enables controlled release of captured electrons over durations spanning from seconds to 30 days. Furthermore, it allows tailorable radioluminescence emission within the range of 520&#8208;580 nm and fine&#8208;tuning of thermally&#8208;stimulated temperature between 313&#8208;403 K. We further utilize these scintillators to fabricate high&#8208;density, large&#8208;area scintillation screens that exhibit a 6&#8208;fold improvement in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, 22 lp/mm high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, and a 30&#8208;day&#8208;long optical memory. This enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of injured mice through fast thermally&#8208;stimulated radioluminescence readout. These findings offer new insights into the correlation of radioluminescence dynamics with energy funneling kinetics, thereby contributing to the advancement of high&#8208;energy nanophotonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage Engineering in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic C2H4 Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.</dc:description>

         <title>Organometallic Chirality Sensing via &#8220;Click&#8221;&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;Arene Coordination with an Achiral Cp*Ru(II) Piano Stool Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piano stool complexes have been studied over many years and found widespread applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, materials and drug development. We now report the first examples of quantitative chiroptical molecular recognition of chiral compounds through click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;arene coordination with readily available half sandwich complexes. This conceptually new approach to chirality sensing is based on irreversible acetonitrile displacement of [Cp*Ru(CH3CN)3]PF6 by an aromatic target molecule, a process that is fast and complete within a few minutes at room temperature. The metal coordination coincides with characteristic circular dichroism inductions that can be easily correlated to the absolute configuration and enantiomeric ratio of the bound molecule. A relay assay that decouples the determination of the enantiomeric composition and of the total sample amount by a practical CD/UV measurement protocol was developed and successfully tested. The introduction of piano stool complexes to the chiroptical sensing realm is mechanistically unique and extends the scope of currently known methods with small&#8208;molecule probes that require the presence of amino, alcohol, carboxylate or other privileged functional groups for binding of the target compound. A broad application range including pharmaceutically relevant multifunctional molecules and the use in chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis are also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>An MBene Modulating the Buried SnO2/Perovskite Interface in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface&#160;of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role in transferring and collecting charges. Interface defects are important factors affecting the efficiency and stability of PSCs.&#160;Here, the buried interface between SnO2&#160;and the perovskite layer is bridged by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MBene, which improves charge transfer. MBene can deposit additional electrons on the surface of SnO2, passivate&#160;its surface defects and facilitate&#160;the charge collection.&#160;Moreover,&#160;the dipole moment formed at the interface increases the electron transfer ability in the PSCs.&#160;MBene also regulates the growth of perovskite crystals, improves the quality of perovskite films, and reduces&#160;its grain boundary defects.&#160;As a result, PSCs based on FA0.2MA0.8PbI3&#160;and (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05&#160;get the enhanced efficiencies of 22.34% and 24.32% with&#160;negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the optimized device exhibits better stability. This work opens up the application of MBene materials in PSCs, reveals a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind using 2D materials as an interface modification layer,&#160;and shows opportunities for using MBene as potential material&#160;in photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Zirconia Supported Intermetallic Platinum Alloy via Reactive Metal&#8208;Support Interactions for High&#8208;Performing Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and anti&#8208;corrosive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance for the applications of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Herein, we report a novel approach to prepare metal oxides&#8208;supported intermetallic Pt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) via the reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI) as ORR catalysts, using Ni&#8208;doped cubic ZrO2 (Ni/ZrO2) supported L10&#8208;PtNi NPs as a proof of concept. Benefiting from the Ni migration during RMSI, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the support is increased, leading to an electron enrichment of Pt. The optimal L10&#8208;PtNi&#8208;Ni/ZrO2&#8208;RMSI catalyst achieves remarkably low mass activity (MA) loss (17.8%) after 400,000 accelerated durability test cycles in a half&#8208;cell and exceptional PEMFC performance (MA = 0.76&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1&#160;at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density = 1.52/0.92&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#160;in H2&#8208;O2/&#8208;air, and 18.4% MA decay&#160;after 30,000&#8197;cycles), representing the best reported Pt&#8208;based ORR catalysts without carbon supports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that L10&#8208;PtNi&#8208;Ni/ZrO2&#8208;RMSI requires a lower energetic barrier for ORR than L10&#8208;PtNi&#8208;Ni/ZrO2 (direct loading), which is ascribed to a decreased Bader charge transfer between Pt and *OH, and the improved stability of L10&#8208;PtNi&#8208;Ni/ZrO2&#8208;RMSI compared to L10&#8208;PtNi&#8208;C can be contributed to the increased adhesion energy and Ni vacancy formation energy within the PtNi alloy.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Substrate Sensing in Terpene Synthases from Plants and Microorganisms: Insight from Structural, Bioinformatic, and EnzyDock Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpene synthases sense their substrates in a binary manner via one of two reactive oxygen atoms. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to these enzymes originating from plants or microorganisms.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) catalyze the first step in the formation of terpenoids, which comprise the largest class of natural products in nature. TPSs employ a family of universal natural substrates, composed of isoprenoid units bound to a diphosphate moiety. The intricate structures generated by TPSs are the result of substrate binding and folding in the active site, enzyme&#8208;controlled carbocation reaction cascades, and final reaction quenching. A key unaddressed question in class I TPSs is the asymmetric nature of the diphosphate&#8208;(Mg2+)3 cluster, which forms a critical part of the active site. In this asymmetric ion cluster, two diphosphate oxygen atoms protrude into the active site pocket. The substrate hydrocarbon tail, which is eventually molded into terpenes, can bind to either of these oxygen atoms, yet to which is unknown. Herein, we employ structural, bioinformatics, and EnzyDock docking tools to address this enigma. We bring initial data suggesting that this difference is rooted in evolutionary differences between TPSs. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to TPSs originating from plants or microorganisms. We further suggest that this difference can cast light on the frequent observation that the chiral products or intermediates of plant and bacterial terpene synthases represent opposite enantiomers.

         <title>Theoretical Prediction Leads to Synthesize GDY Supported InOx Quantum Dots for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The target catalysts with high activity and selectivity towards CO2RR were predicted by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using GDY supported QDs as the ideal model, which presents an effective strategy for rational design of new heterostructure electrocatalysts to achieve highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.







Abstract
The preparation of formic acid by direct reduction of carbon dioxide is an important basis for the future chemical industry and is of great significance. Due to the serious shortage of highly active and selective electrocatalysts leading to the development of direct reduction of carbon dioxide is limited. Herein the target catalysts with high CO2RR activity and selectivity were identified by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using graphdiyne (GDY) supported metal oxides quantum dots (QDs) as the ideal model. It is theoretically predicted that GDY supported indium oxide QDs (i.e., InOx/GDY) is a new heterostructure electrocatalyst candidate with optimal CO2RR performance. The interfacial electronic strong interactions effectively regulate the surface charge distribution of QDs and affect the adsorption/desorption behavior of HCOO* intermediate during CO2RR to achieve highly efficient CO2 conversion. Based on the predicted composition and structure, we synthesized the advanced catalytic system, and demonstrates superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion performance. The study presents an effective strategy for rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts to promote green chemical production.

         <title>Final Stages in the Biosynthesis of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Text for TOC The final stages of the biosynthesis of the [FeFe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases are elucidated by a combination of organometallic synthesis and biophysical analysis. The complex [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; containing the unprecedented aminomethylthiolate ligand, allows maturation of HydA1 in the presence of HydF and the established cocktail of reagents and proteins. The same complex maturates HydA1 using a simplified protein&#8208;free recipe.







Abstract
The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The recently hypothesized intermediate [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; ([1]2&#8722;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe2(S2)(CN)(CO)5]&#8722;. The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CNBEt3)(CO)5]&#8722;, [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)&#8722;(CO)5]&#8722;, and [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722;, where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]+, PPh4+ and PPN+ salts as well as the 13CD2&#8208;isotopologues. These Fe2 species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial&#8208;equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur. In vitro experiments demonstrate that [1]2&#8722; maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.

         <title>Radical Homopolymerization of Linear &#945;&#8208;Olefins Enabled by 1,4&#8208;Cyano Group Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Olefins are valued and abundant building blocks from fossil resources. They are widely used to provide small&#8208;molecule or polymeric products. Despite numerous advantages of radical polymerization, it has been well&#8208;documented as textbook knowledge that &#945;&#8208;olefins and their functionalized derivatives cannot be radically homopolymerized because of the degradative chain transfer side reactions. Herein, we report our studies on the homopolymerization of thiocyanate functionalized &#945;&#8208;olefins enabled by 1,4&#8208;cyano group migration under radical conditions. By this approach, a library of ABC sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with high molecular weights can be prepared. We can also extend this strategy to the homopolymerization of &#945;&#8208;substituted styrenic and acylate monomers which are known to be challenging to achieve. Overall, the demonstrated functional group migration radical polymerization could provide new possibilities to synthesize polymers with unprecedented main chain sequences and structures. These polymers are promising candidates for novel polymeric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ideal Cage&#8208;like Pores for Molecular Sieving of Butane Isomers with High Purity and Record Productivity&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 are both important petrochemical raw materials. Considering the coexistence of the isomers in the production process, it is necessary to achieve their efficient separation through an economical way. However, to obtain high&#8208;purity n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 in one&#8208;step separation process, developing iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion adsorbents with high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity is crucial. Herein, we report a cage&#8208;like MOF (SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA) with small windows and large cavities which can selectively allow smaller n&#8208;C4H10 enter the pore and accommodate a large amount of n&#8208;C4H10 simultaneously. Adsorption isotherms reveal that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA not only completely excludes iso&#8208;C4H10 in a wide temperature range, but also exhibits a very high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity of 94.2 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 100 kPa and 298 K, which is the highest value among iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion&#8208;type adsorbents. Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has excellent n/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation performance and can achieve a record&#8208;high productivity of iso&#8208;C4H10&#160;(3.2 mol&#160;kg&#8208;1)&#160;with high purity (&gt;99.95%) as well as 3.0 mol kg&#8208;1 of n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.</dc:description>

Abstract
The generation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) largely determines the comprehensive performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, a novel &#8220;carrier&#8208;catalytic&#8221; integrated design is strategically exploited to in situ construct a stable LiF&#8208;LiBr rich SEI by improving the electron transfer kinetics to accelerate the bond&#8208;breaking dynamics. Specifically, the high electron transport capacity of Br&#8208;TPOM skeleton increases the polarity of C&#8722;Br, thus promoting the generation of LiBr. Then, the enhancement of electron transfer kinetics further promotes the fracture of C&#8722;F from TFSI&#8722; to form LiF. Finally, the stable and homogeneous artificial&#8208;SEI with enriched lithium dihalide is constructed through the in situ co&#8208;growth mechanism of LiF and LiBr, which facilitatse the Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics and regulates the lithium deposition behavior. Impressively, the PEO&#8208;Br&#8208;TPOM paired with LiFePO4 delivers ultra&#8208;long cycling stability over 1000&#8197;cycles with 81&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C while the pouch cells possess 88&#8201;% superior capacity retention after 550&#8197;cycles with initial discharge capacity of 145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1at 0.2&#8197;C in the absence of external pressure. Even under stringent conditions, the practical pouch cells possess the practical capacity with stable electric quantities plateau in 30&#8197;cycles demonstrates its application potential in energy storage field.

         <title>Bending, Twisting, and Propulsion of Photoreactive Crystals by Controlled Gas Release</title>

         <dc:description>
Hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in liquid media and excited by light.







Abstract
The rapid release of gas by a chemical reaction to generate momentum is one of the most fundamental ways to elicit motion that could be used to sustain and control the motility of objects. We report that hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in mother solution. In needle&#8208;like regular crystals, the reaction occurs mainly on the surface and results in the formation of cracks that evolve due to internal pressure; the expansion on the cracked surface of the crystal results in bending, twisting, or coiling of the crystal. In hollow crystals, gas accumulates inside their cavities and emanates preferentially from the recess at the crystal terminus, propelling the crystals to undergo directional photomechanical motion through the mother solution. The motility of the object which can be controlled externally to perform work delineates the concept of &#8220;crystal microbots&#8221;, realized by photoreactive organic crystals capable of prolonged directional motion for actuation or delivery. Within the prospects, we envisage the development of a plethora of light&#8208;weight, efficient, autonomously operating robots based on organic crystals with high work capacity where motion over large distances can be attained due to the large volume of latent gas generated from a small volume of the crystalline solid.

         <title>Homochiral &#960;&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled Chirality Imprinting in Conjugated Polymers: Confined Polymerization and Chiral Memory from Scratch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) were synthesized through confined polymerization within &#960;&#8208;rich homochiral covalent organic frameworks, utilizing a chiral imprinting process. The isolated OACPs retained chirality and displayed robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids.







Abstract
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) have garnered increasing research interest for their resemblance to biological helices and intriguing chirality&#8208;related functions. Traditional methods for synthesizing involve decorating achiral conjugated polymer architectures with enantiopure side substituents through complex organic synthesis. Here, we report a new approach: the templated synthesis of unsubstituted OACPs via supramolecularly confined polymerizations of achiral monomers within nanopores of 2D or 3D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs). We show that the chiral &#960;&#8208;rich nanospaces facilitate the in situ enantiospecific polymerization and self&#8208;propagation, akin to nonenzymatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, resulting in chiral imprinting. The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200&#8201;&#176;C. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorption/Fluorescence of D&#8211;A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers Composed of Strong Electron Acceptors Based on Boron&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel strong electron&#8208;accepting units for providing second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence with donor&#8211;acceptor polymers are presented. Introducing trifluoromethyl group to boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes improves both their electron&#8208;accepting ability and solubility. Owing to their bulky structures and excellent light&#8208;absorption ability, bright NIR&#8208;II fluorescence is observed from polymer solutions, films, and nanoparticles.







Abstract
Luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1,000&#8211;1,700&#8197;nm) window is beneficial especially for deep tissue imaging and optical sensors because of intrinsic high permeability through various media. Strong electron&#8208;acceptors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are a crucial unit for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) with the NIR&#8208;II emission property, however, limited kinds of molecular skeletons are still available. Herein, D&#8211;A CPs involving fluorinated boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes (BAz) with enhanced electron&#8208;accepting properties are reported. Combination of fluorination at the azobenzene ligand and trifluoromethylation at the boron can effectively lower the LUMO energy level down to &#8722;4.42&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of conventional strong electron&#8208;acceptors. The synthesized series of CPs showed excellent absorption/fluorescence property in solution over a wide NIR range including NIR&#8208;II. Furthermore, owing to the inherent solid&#8208;state emissive property of the BAz skeleton, obvious NIR&#8208;II fluorescence from the film (up to &#955;FL=1213&#8197;nm) and the nanoparticle in water (&#955;FL=1036&#8197;nm, brightness=up to 29&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;M&#8722;1) were observed, proposing that our materials are applicable for developing next&#8208;generation of NIR&#8208;II luminescent materials.

         <title>Precision Engineering of the Co&#8208;immobilization of Enzymes for Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;layered coating approach was developed for the precise and sequential immobilization of dual&#8208;enzyme systems on resin particles using two biorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition. The method enables the combined purification and the ordered immobilization of enzymes and significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency and recyclability of multienzyme systems.







Abstract
The design and orderly layered co&#8208;immobilization of multiple enzymes on resin particles remain challenging. In this study, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher binding pair was fused to the N&#8208;terminus of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldo&#8208;keto reductase (AKR), respectively. A non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA), p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (p&#8208;AzF), as the anchor for covalent bonding enzymes, was genetically inserted into preselected sites in the AKR and ADH. Employing the two bioorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition for the immobilization of AKR and ADH enabled sequential dual&#8208;enzyme coating on porous microspheres. The ordered dual&#8208;enzyme reactor was subsequently used to synthesize (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanol asymmetrically from the corresponding prochiral ketone, enabling the in situ regeneration of NADPH. The reactor exhibited a high catalytic conversion of 74&#8201;% and good reproducibility, retaining 80&#8201;% of its initial activity after six cycles. The product had 99.9&#8201;% ee, which that was maintained in each cycle. Additionally, the double&#8208;layer immobilization method significantly increased the enzyme loading capacity, which was approximately 1.7&#8197;times greater than that of traditional single&#8208;layer immobilization. More importantly, it simultaneously enabled both the purification and immobilization of multiple enzymes on carriers, thus providing a convenient approach to facilitate cascade biocatalysis.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Modified RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the field of chemical RNA synthesis are discussed, starting with protection concepts, followed by selected nucleoside modifications that are challenging to incorporate into RNA. Comments on the chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs, the enzymatic ligation of synthetic RNA, and RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modifications using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functional groups complete this minireview.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play a vital role in living organisms. Many of their cellular functions depend critically on chemical modification. Methods to modify RNA in a controlled manner&#8212;both in vitro and in vivo&#8212;are thus essential to evaluate and understand RNA biology at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site&#8208;specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid&#8208;phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, N4&#8208;acetylcytidine, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytidine, 3&#8208;methylcytidine, 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3, and 2&#8242;&#8208;N3 ribose modifications. We also discuss the all&#8208;chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single&#8208;molecule FRET studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.

The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site-specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid-phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-acetylcytidine, 5-hydroxymethylcytidine, 3-methylcytidine, 2&#8242;-OCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2&#8242;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ribose modifications. We also discuss the all-chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;-capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single-molecule FRET studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA-catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stoichiometric Haloform Coupling for Ester Synthesis with Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general haloform coupling reaction for the synthesis of esters from methyl ketones is reported using one equivalent of alcohol. Detailed kinetic modelling studies demonstrate that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which led to the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.

Abstract
The haloform reaction from methyl ketones to carboxylic acids is one of the oldest known synthetic organic reactions, which has been used in myriad applications over the decades. The corresponding reaction to produce esters is, however, less developed, as the reaction is generally limited to simple, primary alcohols that are used in solvent&#8208;level quantities, thereby restricting the complexity of esters that can be directly formed. Herein, we detail the development of a general ester&#8208;forming haloform coupling reaction using one equivalent of alcohol. Mechanistic and kinetic modelling studies demonstrated that the key intermediates are formed under equilibrium, which facilitated the development of conditions that are amenable to secondary alcohols.

Exploring New Paths for Solar Energy Storage: A Win&#8208;Win Approach for rGO/CdS to Improve the Energy Conversion Efficiency and Stability of Integrated Photorechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries.







Abstract
Integrating solar energy into rechargeable battery systems represents a significant advancement towards sustainable energy storage solutions. Herein, we propose a win&#8208;win solution to reduce the shuttle effect of polysulfide and improve the photocorrosion stability of CdS, thereby enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of rGO/CdS&#8208;based photorechargeable integrated lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PRLSBs). Experimental results show that CdS can effectively anchor polysulfide under sunlight irradiation for 20&#8197;minutes. Under a high current density (1&#8197;C), the discharge&#8208;specific capacity of the PRLSBs increased to 971.30&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 113.3&#8201;% enhancement compared to that of under dark condition (857.49&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Remarkably, without an electrical power supply, the PRLSBs can maintain a 21&#8197;hours discharge process following merely 1.5&#8197;hours of light irradiation, achieving a breakthrough solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion efficiency of up to 5.04&#8201;%. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman analysis corroborate the effectiveness of this complementary weakness approach in bolstering redox kinetics and curtailing polysulfide dissolution in PRLSBs. This work showcases a feasible strategy to develop PRLSBs with potential dual&#8208;functional metal sulfide photoelectrodes, which will be of great interest in future&#8208;oriented off&#8208;grid photocell systems.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Water in Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of Methanol Conversion for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol and the desorption of liquid products from photocatalytic methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, which leads to a nearly linear increase of the H2 production with the reduction of water content in methanol aqueous solution.







Abstract
Water molecules, which act as both solvent and reactant, play critical roles in photocatalytic reactions for methanol conversion. However, the influence of water on the adsorption of methanol and desorption of liquid products, which are two essential steps that control the performance in photocatalysis, has been well under&#8208;explored. Herein, we reveal the role of water in heterogeneous photocatalytic processes of methanol conversion on the platinized carbon nitride (Pt/C3N4) model photocatalyst. In situ spectroscopy techniques, isotope effects, and computational calculations demonstrate that water shows adverse effects on the adsorption of methanol molecules and desorption processes of methanol oxidation products on the surface of Pt/C3N4, significantly altering the reaction pathways in photocatalytic methanol conversion process. Guided by these discoveries, a photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system is designed to achieve a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 2.3&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported. This work highlights the important roles of solvents in controlling the adsorption/desorption behaviours of liquid&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Stereodivergent, Kinetically Controlled Isomerization of Terminal Alkenes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic alkene mono&#8208;transposition generates E&#8208; or Z&#8208;olefins depending on the steric properties and denticity of the ligand employed. Mechanistic studies reveal that the aryl iodide additive acts as a redox buffer for nickel in the Z&#8208;selective reaction, generating the most&#8208;selective NiII&#8211;H that outcompetes a less Z&#8208;selective NiI&#8211;H species. For the E&#8208;selective reaction, the phosphonium salt plays a dual role as an acid and ligand, forming a phosphine&#8208;bound cationic Ni&#8722;H catalyst in situ.







Abstract
Because internal alkenes are more challenging synthetic targets than terminal alkenes, metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin mono&#8208;transposition (i.e., positional isomerization) approaches have emerged to afford valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208; internal alkenes from their complementary terminal alkene feedstocks. However, the applicability of these methods has been hampered by lack of generality, commercial availability of precatalysts, and scalability. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed platform for the stereodivergent E/Z&#8208;selective synthesis of internal alkenes at room temperature. Commercial reagents enable this one&#8208;carbon transposition of terminal alkenes to valuable E&#8208; or Z&#8208;internal alkenes via a Ni&#8722;H&#8208;mediated insertion/elimination mechanism. Though the mechanistic regime is the same in both systems, the underlying pathways that lead to each of the active catalysts are distinct, with the Z&#8208;selective catalyst forming from comproportionation of an oxidative addition complex followed by oxidative addition with substrate and the E&#8208;selective catalyst forming from protonation of the metal by the trialkylphosphonium salt additive. In each case, ligand sterics and denticity control stereochemistry and prevent over&#8208;isomerization.

         <title>Dithienoquinoxalineimide&#8208;Based Polymer Donor Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor QQ1 via introducing a dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) A unit. The binary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT and ternary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8201;:&#8201;F&#8208;BTA3 all&#8208;PSCs present high PCEs of 18.81&#8201;% and 19.20&#8201;% respectively, benefiting from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications owing to their outstanding advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and stable film morphology. However, compared to large amount of new&#8208;emerging excellent polymer acceptors, the development of high&#8208;performance polymer donor lags behind. Herein, a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor, namely QQ1, was developed based on dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) as the A unit, benzodithiophene with thiophene&#8208;conjugated side chains (BDTT) as the D unit, and alkyl&#8208;thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridge, respectively. QQ1 not only possesses a strong dipole moment, but also shows a wide band gap of 1.80&#8197;eV and a deep HOMO energy level of &#8722;5.47&#8197;eV, even without halogen substituents that are commonly indispensable for high&#8208;performance polymer donors. When blended with a classic polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, the QQ1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC delivers an outstanding PCE of 18.81&#8201;%. After the introduction of F&#8208;BTA3 as the third component, a record PCE of 19.20&#8201;% was obtained, the highest value reported so far for all&#8208;PSCs. The impressive photovoltaic performance originates from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a new D-&#960;-A type polymer donor QQ1 via introducing a dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) A unit. The binary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY-IT and ternary QQ1&#8201;:&#8201;PY-IT&#8201;:&#8201;F-BTA3 all-PSCs present high PCEs of 18.81&#8201;% and 19.20&#8201;% respectively, benefiting from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications owing to their outstanding advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and stable film morphology. However, compared to large amount of new-emerging excellent polymer acceptors, the development of high-performance polymer donor lags behind. Herein, a new D-&#960;-A type polymer donor, namely QQ1, was developed based on dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) as the A unit, benzodithiophene with thiophene-conjugated side chains (BDTT) as the D unit, and alkyl-thiophene as the &#960;-bridge, respectively. QQ1 not only possesses a strong dipole moment, but also shows a wide band gap of 1.80&#8197;eV and a deep HOMO energy level of &#8722;5.47&#8197;eV, even without halogen substituents that are commonly indispensable for high-performance polymer donors. When blended with a classic polymer acceptor PY-IT, the QQ1-based all-PSC delivers an outstanding PCE of 18.81&#8201;%. After the introduction of F-BTA3 as the third component, a record PCE of 19.20&#8201;% was obtained, the highest value reported so far for all-PSCs. The impressive photovoltaic performance originates from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking.

         <title>Rational Design of an In&#8208;Situ Polymer&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Realising Stable Zn Metal Anode under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust polymer&#8208;inorganic SEI is in situ constructed on Zn anode through controllable polymerization and coprecipitation mechanism. Compared with bare Zn and recent in situ SEIs, polymer&#8208;inorganic SEI combines both superiorities of polymer phases for high toughness and inorganic phases for high modulus, enabling stable electrode/electrolyte interface even under harsh conditions.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth understanding of the composition&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the basis of developing a reliable SEI to stablize the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface, but it remains unclear in rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries. Herein, a well&#8208;designed electrolyte based on 2&#8197;M Zn(CF3SO3)2&#8208;0.2&#8197;M acrylamide&#8208;0.2&#8197;M ZnSO4 is proposed. A robust polymer (polyacrylamide)&#8208;inorganic (Zn4SO4(OH)6.xH2O) hybrid SEI is in situ constructed on Zn anodes through controllable polymerization of acrylamide and coprecipitation of SO42&#8722; with Zn2+ and OH&#8722;. For the first time, the underlying SEI composition&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship is systematically investigated and correlated. The results showed that the polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI, which integrates the high modulus of the inorganic component with the high toughness of the polymer ingredient, can realize high reversibility and long&#8208;term interfacial stability, even under ultrahigh areal current density and capacity (30&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2~30&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The resultant Zn||NH4V4O10 cell also exhibits excellent cycling stability. This work will provide a guidance for the rational design of SEI layers in rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Understanding Defects in Amorphous Silicon with Million&#8208;Atom Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning methods and computational chemistry are combined to develop a comprehensive understanding of coordination defects in amorphous silicon. Fivefold&#8208;connected atoms fall into three categories based on their chemical structure, and are found to cluster together, which can be explained based on energetic arguments.







Abstract
The structure of amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si) is widely thought of as a fourfold&#8208;connected random network, and yet it is defective atoms, with fewer or more than four bonds, that make it particularly interesting. Despite many attempts to explain such &#8220;dangling&#8208;bond&#8221; and &#8220;floating&#8208;bond&#8221; defects, respectively, a unified understanding is still missing. Here, we use advanced computational chemistry methods to reveal the complex structural and energetic landscape of defects in a&#8208;Si. We study an ultra&#8208;large&#8208;scale, quantum&#8208;accurate structural model containing a million atoms, and thousands of individual defects, allowing reliable defect&#8208;related statistics to be obtained. We combine structural descriptors and machine&#8208;learned atomic energies to develop a classification of the different types of defects in a&#8208;Si. The results suggest a revision of the established floating&#8208;bond model by showing that fivefold&#8208;bonded atoms in a&#8208;Si exhibit a wide range of local environments&#8211;analogous to fivefold centers in coordination chemistry. Furthermore, it is shown that fivefold (but not threefold) coordination defects tend to cluster together. Our study provides new insights into one of the most widely studied amorphous solids, and has general implications for understanding defects in disordered materials beyond silicon alone.

Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are porous nanomaterials that offer exceptional biocompatibility and versatility for integrating proteins for biomedical applications. This minireview concisely discusses recent advancements in the chemistry and functionality of protein&#8208;HOF interfaces. It particularly focuses on strategic methodologies, such as the careful selection of building blocks and the genetic engineering of proteins, to facilitate protein&#8208;HOF interactions. We examine the role of enzyme encapsulation within HOFs, highlighting its capability to preserve enzyme function, a crucial aspect for applications in biosensing and disease diagnosis. Moreover, we discuss the emerging utility of nanoscale HOFs for intracellular protein delivery, illustrating their applicability as nanoreactors for intracellular catalysis and neuroprotective biorthogonal catalysis within cellular compartments. We highlight the significant advancement of designing biodegradable HOFs tailored for cytosolic protein delivery, underscoring their promising application in targeted cancer therapies. Finally, we provide a perspective viewpoint on the design of biocompatible protein&#8208;HOF assemblies, underlining their promising prospects in drug delivery, disease diagnosis, and broader biomedical applications.

         <dc:description>
Electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of widely available carboxylate nucleophiles with aryl bromides are developed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral cross&#8208;coupling expands the chemical space of paired electrosynthesis and represents a sustainable method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond.







Abstract
Paired redox&#8208;neutral electrolysis offers an attractive green platform for organic synthesis by avoiding sacrificial oxidants and reductants. Carboxylates are non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive, and widely available, making them ideal nucleophiles for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here, we report the electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of pristine carboxylates with aryl bromides. At a cathode, a NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate is formed through the activation of Ar&#8722;Br bond by a NiI&#8208;bipyridine catalyst and subsequent reduction. At an anode, the carboxylates, including amino acid, benzyl carboxylic acid, and 2&#8208;phenoxy propionic acid, undergo oxidative decarboxylation to form carbon&#8208;based free radicals. The combination of NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate and carbon radical results in the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling products. The adaptation of this electrosynthesis method to flow synthesis and valuable molecule synthesis was demonstrated. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied through electrochemical voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies. The relationships between the electrochemical properties of carboxylates and the reaction selectivity were revealed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions described herein expand the chemical space of paired electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling and represent a promising method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds because of the ubiquitous carboxylate nucleophiles and the innate scalability and flexibility of electrochemical flow&#8208;synthesis technology.

Here, we report the electro/Ni dual-catalyzed redox-neutral decarboxylative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling reactions of pristine carboxylates with aryl bromides. At a cathode, a Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Ar)(Br) intermediate is formed through the activation of Ar&#8722;Br bond by a Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-bipyridine catalyst and subsequent reduction. At an anode, the carboxylates, including amino acid, benzyl carboxylic acid, and 2-phenoxy propionic acid, undergo oxidative decarboxylation to form carbon-based free radicals. The combination of Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Ar)(Br) intermediate and carbon radical results in the formation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling products. The adaptation of this electrosynthesis method to flow synthesis and valuable molecule synthesis was demonstrated. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied through electrochemical voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies. The relationships between the electrochemical properties of carboxylates and the reaction selectivity were revealed. The electro/Ni dual-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions described herein expand the chemical space of paired electrochemical C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling and represent a promising method for the construction of the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds because of the ubiquitous carboxylate nucleophiles and the innate scalability and flexibility of electrochemical flow-synthesis technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Minimalistic Covalent Bond&#8208;Forming Chemical Reaction Cycle that Consumes Adenosine Diphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials that consume chemical energy are fundamental to the development of synthetic active matter, yet the complexity of their reaction cycles hinders understanding how energy is used. The creation of a fully characterised minimalistic metabolic cycle based on the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) driven assembly of building blocks has allowed insight to be gained into the way energy is dissipated by the network and uncover general design principles for driven systems.







Abstract
The development of synthetic active matter requires the ability to design materials capable of harnessing energy from a source to carry out work. Nature achieves this using chemical reaction cycles in which energy released from an exergonic chemical reaction is used to drive biochemical processes. Although many chemically fuelled synthetic reaction cycles that control transient responses, such as self&#8208;assembly, have been reported, the generally high complexity of the reported systems hampers a full understanding of how the available chemical energy is actually exploited by these systems. This lack of understanding is a limiting factor in the design of chemically fuelled active matter. Here, we report a minimalistic synthetic responsive reaction cycle in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) triggers the formation of a catalyst for its own hydrolysis. This establishes an interdependence between the concentrations of the network components resulting in the transient formation of the catalyst. The network is sufficiently simple that all kinetic and thermodynamic parameters governing its behaviour can be characterised, allowing kinetic models to be built that simulate the progress of reactions within the network. While the current network does not enable the ADP&#8208;hydrolysis reaction to populate a non&#8208;equilibrium composition, these models provide insight into the way the network dissipates energy. Furthermore, essential design principles are revealed for constructing driven systems, in which the network composition is driven away from equilibrium through the consumption of chemical energy.

         <title>Conjugation and Topology Engineering of 2D &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Robust Potassium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The evolution of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) provides a significant prospect for researching the next generation of green and advanced energy storage systems (ESSs). Especially, conjugation and topology engineering serve as an irreplaceable character in adjusting the electrochemical properties of ESSs. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy using conjugation and topology engineering to demonstrate the application of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in robust potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) for the first time. By comparing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with the rhombus/kagome structure as well as three/four&#8208;arm core, the rhombus structure (sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF) cathode for PIBs can display the impressive electrochemical performance, including a high specific discharge capacity of 178.4 mAh g&#8208;1 (at 0.2 A g&#8208;1) and a well long&#8208;term cycle stability of more than 9,000 (at 10.0 A g&#8208;1). Moreover, full PIBs (FPIBs) are constructed by pairing sql&#8208;Cu&#8208;TBA&#8208;MOF cathode with dipotassium terephthalate (KTP) anode, which delivers a high reversible discharge specific capacity of 146.6 mAh g&#8208;1 (at 0.1 A g&#8208;1) and great practical application prospect. These findings provide reasonable implications for the design of 2D c&#8208;MOFs from the perspective of conjugation and topology engineering for advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation polymerization (CHAP) is an attractive tool for constructing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers in a sustainable manner. However, the existing methods primarily rely on palladium catalysis, which usually entails harsh reaction conditions and branching/cross&#8208;linking. Here we report the first example of an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation polymerization induced by visible light irradiation. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Photogeneration of Chlorine Radical from a Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorous 4CzIPN&#8226;Chloride Complex: Application in C&#8211;H bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chlorine radical is a strong HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) agent that is very useful for the functionalization of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. Albeit highly attractive, its generation from the poorly oxidizable chloride ion mediated by an excited photoredox catalyst is a difficult task. We now report that 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN, an electron&#8208;deficient fluorous derivative of the benchmark 4CzIPN photoredox catalyst belonging to the donor&#8208;acceptor carbazole&#8208;cyanoarene family, is not only a better photooxidant than 4CzIPN, but also becomes an excellent host for the chloride ion. Combining these two properties ultimately makes the self&#8208;assembled 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN&#8226;Cl&#8211; dual catalyst highly reactive in redox&#8208;neutral Giese&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8208;H bond alkylation reactions promoted by the chlorine radical. Additionally, because of its fluorous character, the efficient separation/recovery of 8Rf8&#8208;4CzIPN could be envisioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of (&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes Reveals an Unusual Indole Ring Cleavage Pathway Catalyzed by P450 Monooxygenase</title>

         <dc:description>(&#177;)&#8208;Penindolenes A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), the first representatives of indole terpenoids featuring a &#947;&#8208;lactam skeleton, were isolated from the mangrove&#8208;derived endophytic fungus Penicillium brocae MA&#8208;231. Our bioactivity tests revealed their potent antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. The biosynthetic reactions by the five enzymes PbaABCDE leading to &#947;&#8208;lactam ring formation were identified with heterologous expression and in vitro enzymatic assays. Remarkably, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase PbaB and its homolog in Aspergillus oryzae &#160;catalyzed the 2,3&#8208;cleavage of the indole ring to generate two keto groups in 1, in different manners from well&#8208;known tryptophan dioxygenases. This is the first example of the oxidative cleavage of indole by a P450 monooxygenase. In addition, rare secondary amide bond formation by the glutamine synthetase&#8208;like enzyme PbaD was reported. These findings will contribute to the engineered biosynthesis of unnatural, bioactive indole terpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Isothermal Phase Transitions in Liquid Crystals Driven by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic nature of calamitic liquid crystals is exploited to perform isothermal phase transitions driven by dynamic covalent chemistry. For this purpose, nematic (N) arrays based on aldehyde&#160;1&#160;were treated with different amines (A&#8208;E) in an on&#8208;surface process, which resulted in different isothermal phase transitions. These phase transformations were caused by&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;imination reactions and are dependent on the nature of the added amine. Transitions from the N to crystal (1A,&#160;1E), isotropic (1B), and smectic (Sm) (1C,&#160;1D) phases were achieved, while&#160;the&#160;resulting&#160;materials feature thermotropic liquid crystal behavior. A sequential transformation from the N&#160;1&#160;to the Sm&#160;1C&#160;and then to the N&#160;1B&#160;was achieved by coupling an imination&#160;to&#160;a transimination processes and adjusting the temperature. All of these processes were well characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic, and X&#8208;ray techniques, unlocking not only the constitutional but also the structural aspects of the phase transitions. This work provides new insights into designing constitutionally and structurally adaptable liquid crystal systems, paving the way toward the conception of programable evolutive pathways and adaptive materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp2)&#8211;H functionalization offers an efficient strategy for the synthesis of various elaborated N&#8208;containing heteroarenes. Along these lines, oxazino pyridines that can be readily prepared from pyridines, have been introduced as powerful substrates in radical&#8208; and ionic&#8208;mediated meta&#8208;C&#8211;H functionalization. However, the regioselective meta&#8208;C&#8211;H arylation of pyridines remains a great challenge. Herein, a copper&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;selective C&#8211;H arylation of pyridines and isoquinolines through bench&#8208;stable dearomatized intermediates is reported. Electrophilic aryl&#8208;Cu(III) species, generated from readily accessible aryl I(III) reagents, enable the efficient meta&#8208;arylation of a broad range of pyridines and isoquinolines. The method also allows the meta&#8208;selective alkenylation of these heteroarenes using the corresponding alkenyl I(III)&#8208;reagents. Late&#8208;stage arylation of drug&#8208;derived pyridines and larger&#8208;scale experiments demonstrate the potential of this synthetic methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Solvent&#8208;Mediated Cyclic Intermediates during the Alkene Epoxidation/Hydration over a Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aprotic acetone&#8208;mediated five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring intermediate as the active site for the epoxidation reaction over a Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system is observed for the first time by using in situ and 2D MAS NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The critical role of this intermediate in cyclohexene epoxidation is revealed.







Abstract
Solvent effects in catalytic reactions have received widespread attention as they can promote reaction rates and product selectivities by orders of magnitude. It is well accepted that the stable five&#8208;membered cyclic intermediates formed between the solvent molecules and Ti species are crucial to the alkene epoxidation in a heterogeneous Ti(IV)&#8722;H2O2 system. However, the direct spectroscopic evidence of these intermediates is still missing and the corresponding reaction pathway for the alkene epoxidation remains unclear. By combining in situ 13C MAS NMR, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 1H&#8722;13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the five&#8208;membered ring structures, where the protic solvents (ROH), and aprotic solvent (acetone), coordinate and stabilize the active Ti species, are identified for the first time over Ti&#8208;Beta/H2O2 system. Moreover, the role of these cyclic intermediates in the alkene epoxidation/hydration conversion is clarified. These results provide new insights into the solvent effect in liquid&#8208;phase epoxidation/hydration reactions over Ti(IV)&#8722;H2O2 system.

         <title>The Use of Xenonucleic Acids Significantly Reduces theIn Vivo Drift of Electrochemical Aptamer&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (EAB) sensors made with DNA support high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. However, to use these sensors for long durations requires their signal to remain stable overtime. Here, we show that, in the living body, enzymatic cleavage of the sensor's DNA aptamer is a major source of signal loss and that this can be reduced by replacing it with an enzyme resistant xeno nucleic acid.







Abstract
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based sensors support the high&#8208;frequency, real&#8208;time monitoring of molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest in vivo. Achieving this requires methods for correcting the sensor drift seen during in vivo placements. While this correction ensures EAB sensor measurements remain accurate, as drift progresses it reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and precision. Here, we show that enzymatic cleavage of the sensor's target&#8208;recognizing DNA aptamer is a major source of this signal loss. To demonstrate this, we deployed a tobramycin&#8208;detecting EAB sensor analog fabricated with the DNase&#8208;resistant &#8220;xenonucleic acid&#8221; 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA in a live rat. In contrast to the sensor employing the equivalent DNA aptamer, the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA aptamer sensor lost very little signal and had improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise. We further characterized the EAB sensor drift using unstructured DNA or 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA oligonucleotides. While the two devices drift similarly in vitro in whole blood, the in vivo drift of the 2&#8217;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;RNA&#8208;employing device is less compared to the DNA&#8208;employing device. Studies of the electron transfer kinetics suggested that the greater drift of the latter sensor arises due to enzymatic DNA degradation. These findings, coupled with advances in the selection of aptamers employing XNA, suggest a means of improving EAB sensor stability when they are used to perform molecular monitoring in the living body.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet carbenes are not always isolable and often even elude direct detection. When they escape observation, their formation can sometimes be evidenced by&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;trapping experiments. However, is carbene&#8208;like reactivity genuine evidence of carbene formation?

When they escape observation, their formation can sometimes be evidenced by&#160;in-situ&#160;trapping experiments. However, is carbene-like reactivity genuine evidence of carbene formation? Herein, using the first example of a spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), we cast doubt on the most common carbene trapping reactions as sufficient proof of carbene formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Ultraviolet Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Cerium Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet circularly polarized luminescence (UV&#8208;CPL) with high photon energy shows great potential in polarized light sources and stereoselective photopolymerization. However, developing luminescent materials with high UV&#8208;CPL performance remains challenging. Here, we report a pair of rare earth Ce3+&#8208;based zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7, which exhibits characteristic UV emissions derived from the Ce 5d&#8208;4f transition. The compounds show simultaneously high photoluminescent quantum yields of (32&#8208;39)% and large luminescent dissymmetry factor (|glum|) values of (1.3&#8208;1.5)&#215;10&#8208;2. Thus, the figures of merits of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7 are calculated to be (4.5&#8208;5.8)&#215;10&#8208;3, which are superior to the reported UV&#8208;CPL emissive materials. Additionally, nearly 91% of their PL intensities at 300 K can be well preserved at 380 K (LED operating temperature) without phase transition or decomposition, demonstrating the excellent structural and optical thermal stabilities of R/S&#8208;(C14H24N2)2CeBr7. Based on these enantiomers, the fabricated UV&#8208;emitting CP&#8208;LEDs exhibit high polarization degrees of &#177;1.0%. Notably, the UV&#8208;CPL generated from the devices can significantly trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene with remarkable stereoselectivity, and consequently yield polymerized products with the anisotropy factors of circular dichroism (gCD) up to &#177;3.9&#215;10&#8208;2, outperforming other UV&#8208;CPL materials and demonstrating their great potential as UV&#8208;polarized light sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Blue Long Afterglow and Ultra Broadband Vis&#8208;NIR Emission from All&#8208;Inorganic Copper&#8208;Doped Silver Halide Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic metal halides with afterglow emission have attracted increasing attention due to their significantly longer afterglow duration and higher stability compared to their organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their afterglow colors have not yet reached the blue spectral region. Here, we report all&#8208;inorganic copper&#8208;doped Rb2AgBr3 single crystals with ultralong blue afterglow (&gt;300 s) by modulating defect states through doping engineering. The introduction of copper(I) ions into Rb2AgBr3 facilitates the formation of bromine vacancies, thus increasing the density of trap states available for charge storage and enabling bright, persistent emission after ceasing the excitation. Moreover, cascade energy transfer between distinct emissive centers in the crystals results in ultra&#8208;broadband photoluminescence, not only covering the whole white light with near&#8208;unity quantum yield but also extending into the near&#8208;infrared region. This &#8216;cocktail&#8217; of exotic light&#8208;emission properties, in conjunction with the excellent stability of copper&#8208;doped Rb2AgBr3 crystals, allowed us to demonstrate their implementation to solid&#8208;state lighting, night vision, and intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Factors Introduced in the Feasibility Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Sensitive Triggers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for cellular signaling. Various pathophysiological conditions are also associated with elevated levels of ROS. Hence, ROS&#8208;sensitive triggers have been extensively used for selective payload delivery. Such applications are predicated on two key functions: (1) a sufficient magnitude of concentration difference for the interested ROS between normal tissue/cells and intended sites and (2) appropriate reaction kinetics to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity for payload release. Further, ROS refers to a group of species with varying reactivity, which should not be viewed as a uniform group. In this review, we critically analyze data on the concentrations of different ROS species under various pathophysiological conditions and examine how reaction kinetics affect the success of ROS&#8208;sensitive linker chemistry. Further, we discuss different ROS linker chemistry in the context of their applications in drug delivery and imaging. This review brings new insights into research in ROS&#8208;triggered delivery, highlights factors to consider in maximizing the chance for success and discusses pitfalls to avoid.</dc:description>

         <title>Perfluorooxosulfate Salts as SOF4&#8208;Gas&#8208;Free Precursors to Multidimensional SuFEx Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry stands as a well&#8208;established method for swiftly constructing complex molecules in a modular fashion. An especially promising segment of this toolbox is reserved for multidimensional SuFEx hubs: three or more substituents pluggable into a singular SVI centre to make &#8216;beyondlinear&#8217; clicked constructions. Sulfurimidoyl difluorides (RNSOF2) stand out as the prime example of this, however their preparation from the scarcely available thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) limits this chemistry to only a few laboratories with access to this gas. In this work, we identify silver pentafluorooxosulfate (AgOSF5) as a viable SuFEx hub with reactivity equal to SOF4. The AgF2&#8208;mediated oxidation of SOCl2 gives rise to the hexacoordinate AgOSF5 adduct, which in contact with primary amines produces the sulfurimidoyl fluorides in high yields. In addition, we have found this workflow to be fully extendable to the trifluoromethyl homologue, AgOSF4CF3, and we propose the use of AgOSF4X salts as a general route to azasulfur SuFEx electrophiles from commercial starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Organo&#8208;Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydroamidation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Azides: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds via direct N&#8208;centered radical addition with olefins under benign conditions is a desirable but challenging strategy. Herein, we describe an organo&#8208;photocatalytic approach to achieve anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydroamidation with sulfonyl azides in a highly efficient manner under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. A broad range of substrates, including both activated and unactivated alkenes, are suitable for this protocol, providing a convenient and practical method to construct sulfonylamide derivatives. A synergistic experimental and computational mechanistic study suggests that the additive, Hantzsch ester (HE), might undergo a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer manner to achieve photosensitization by the organo&#8208;photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. Next, the resulted triplet excited state 3HE* could lead to a homolytic cleavage of C4&#8722;H bond, which triggers a straightforward H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) style in converting sulfonyl azide to the corresponding key amidyl radical. Subsequently, radical addition of the amidyl radical to alkenes followed by HAT from p&#8208;toluenethiol could proceed to afford the desired anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation product. It is worth noting that mechanistic pathway bifurcation could be possible for this reaction. A feasible radical chain propagation mechanistic pathway is also proposed to rationalize the high efficiency of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lipopeptidomimetic of Transcriptional Activation Domains Selectively Disrupts the Coactivator Med25 Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, amphipathic peptide derived from transcriptional activators is transformed from a weak inhibitor of transcriptional protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) to an effective inhibitor through the addition of a chiral, medium&#8208;length lipid. The resulting lipopeptidomimetic (8) selectively blocks Med25 PPIs in vitro, stabilizes full&#8208;length protein, and down&#8208;regulates a key Med25&#8208;dependent gene.







Abstract
Short amphipathic peptides are capable of binding to transcriptional coactivators, often targeting the same binding surfaces as native transcriptional activation domains. However, they do so with modest affinity and generally poor selectivity, limiting their utility as synthetic modulators. Here we show that incorporation of a medium&#8208;chain, branched fatty acid to the N&#8208;terminus of one such heptameric lipopeptidomimetic (LPPM&#8208;8) increases the affinity for the coactivator Med25 &gt;20&#8208;fold (Ki &gt;100&#8197;&#956;M to 4&#8197;&#956;M), rendering it an effective inhibitor of Med25 protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). The lipid structure, the peptide sequence, and the C&#8208;terminal functionalization of the lipopeptidomimetic each influence the structural propensity of LPPM&#8208;8 and its effectiveness as an inhibitor. LPPM&#8208;8 engages Med25 through interaction with the H2 face of its activator interaction domain and in doing so stabilizes full&#8208;length protein in the cellular proteome. Further, genes regulated by Med25&#8208;activator PPIs are inhibited in a cell model of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Thus, LPPM&#8208;8 is a useful tool for studying Med25 and mediator complex biology and the results indicate that lipopeptidomimetics may be a robust source of inhibitors for activator&#8208;coactivator complexes.

     alt="A Lipopeptidomimetic of Transcriptional Activation Domains Selectively Disrupts the Coactivator Med25 Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short, amphipathic peptide derived from transcriptional activators is transformed from a weak inhibitor of transcriptional protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) to an effective inhibitor through the addition of a chiral, medium-length lipid. The resulting lipopeptidomimetic (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) selectively blocks Med25 PPIs in vitro, stabilizes full-length protein, and down-regulates a key Med25-dependent gene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short amphipathic peptides are capable of binding to transcriptional coactivators, often targeting the same binding surfaces as native transcriptional activation domains. However, they do so with modest affinity and generally poor selectivity, limiting their utility as synthetic modulators. Here we show that incorporation of a medium-chain, branched fatty acid to the N-terminus of one such heptameric lipopeptidomimetic (LPPM-8) increases the affinity for the coactivator Med25 &amp;gt;20-fold (&lt;i&gt;Ki&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;100&#8197;&#956;M to 4&#8197;&#956;M), rendering it an effective inhibitor of Med25 protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). The lipid structure, the peptide sequence, and the C-terminal functionalization of the lipopeptidomimetic each influence the structural propensity of LPPM-8 and its effectiveness as an inhibitor. LPPM-8 engages Med25 through interaction with the H2 face of its activator interaction domain and in doing so stabilizes full-length protein in the cellular proteome. Further, genes regulated by Med25-activator PPIs are inhibited in a cell model of triple-negative breast cancer. Thus, LPPM-8 is a useful tool for studying Med25 and mediator complex biology and the results indicate that lipopeptidomimetics may be a robust source of inhibitors for activator-coactivator complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Chemiluminescent Probe for Imaging of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophilic tandem&#8208;locked probe based on a highly efficient chemiluminophore is developed to only activate chemiluminescent signal in the presence of both tumour and M1 macrophage biomarkers, enabling monitoring tumor&#8208;associated macrophage polarization.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor functions; and the targeted polarization from M2 to M1 TAMs has become an effective therapy option. Although detection of M1 TAMs is imperative to assess cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy, existing optical probes suffer from shallow tissue penetration depth and poor specificity toward M1 TAMs. Herein, we report a tandem&#8208;locked NIR chemiluminescent (CL) probe for specific detection of M1 TAMs. Through a combined molecular engineering approach via both atomic alternation and introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophores are screened out to possess record&#8208;long emission (over 800&#8197;nm), record&#8208;high CL quantum yield (2.7&#8201;% einstein/mol), and prolonged half&#8208;life (7.7&#8197;h). Based on an ideal chemiluminophore, the tandem&#8208;locked probe (DPDGN) is developed to only activate CL signal in the presence of both tumour (&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase) and M1 macrophage biomarkers (nitric oxide). Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures its high specificity towards M1 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment over those in normal tissues or peripheral blood. Thus, DPDGN permits noninvasive imaging and tracking of M1 TAM in the tumor of living mice during R837 treatment, showing a good correlation with ex vivo methods. This study not only reports a new molecular approach towards highly efficient chemiluminophores but also reveals the first tandem&#8208;locked CL probes for enhanced imaging specificity.

Search drugs for pain from freshly&#8208;made polychiral heterocycles: Asymmetric Cascade to a C5aR1 inhibitor as a Novel Pain Blocker.







Abstract
This study introduces a novel approach for synthesizing Benzoxazine&#8208;centered Polychiral Polyheterocycles (BPCPHCs) via an innovative asymmetric carbene&#8208;alkyne metathesis&#8208;triggered cascade. Overcoming challenges associated with intricate stereochemistry and multiple chiral centers, the catalytic asymmetric Carbene Alkyne Metathesis&#8208;mediated Cascade (CAMC) is employed using dirhodium catalyst/Br&#248;nsted acid co&#8208;catalysis, ensuring precise stereo control as validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Systematic substrate scope evaluation establishes exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, creating a unique library of BPCPHCs. Pharmacological exploration identifies twelve BPCPHCs as potent Nav ion channel blockers, notably compound 8&#8201;g. In vivo studies demonstrate that intrathecal injection of 8&#8201;g effectively reverses mechanical hyperalgesia associated with chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), suggesting a promising therapeutic avenue. Electrophysiological investigations unveil the inhibitory effects of 8&#8201;g on Nav1.7 currents. Molecular docking, dynamics simulations and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay provide insights into the stable complex formation and favorable binding free energy of 8&#8201;g with C5aR1. This research represents a significant advancement in asymmetric CAMC for BPCPHCs and unveils BPCPHC 8&#8201;g as a promising, uniquely acting pain blocker, establishing a C5aR1&#8208;Nav1.7 connection in the context of CIPN.

         <title>Ynamide and Azaalleneyl. Acid&#8208;Base Promoted Chelotropic and Spin&#8208;State Rearrangements in a Versatile Heterocumulene [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication, we highlight the chelotropic rearrangement of a relatively rare heterocumulene, [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722; on a [VIII] core from &#954;1&#8208;N&#8208;ynamide to a &#954;2&#8208;C,N&#8208;azaalleneyl and vice versa, with an accompanying change in the spin&#8208;state of the metal ion. Our system demonstrates how Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry can trigger, reversibly, chelotropic rearrangements along with significant spin&#8208;state changes.







Abstract
We introduce the heterocumulene ligand [(Ad)NCC(tBu)]&#8722; (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl (C10H15), tBu=tert&#8208;butyl, (C4H9)), which can adopt two forms, the azaalleneyl and ynamide. This ligand platform can undergo a reversible chelotropic shift using Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry, which promotes an unprecedented spin&#8208;state change of the [VIII] ion. These unique scaffolds are prepared via addition of 1&#8208;adamantyl isonitrile (C&#8801;NAd) across the alkylidyne in complexes [(BDI)V&#8801;CtBu(OTf)] (A) (BDI&#8722;=ArNC(CH3)CHC(CH3)NAr), Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) and [(dBDI)V&#8801;CtBu(OEt2)] (B) (dBDI2&#8722;=ArNC(CH3)CHC(CH2)NAr). Complex A reacts with C&#8801;NAd, to generate the high&#8208;spin [VIII] complex with a &#954;1&#8208;N&#8208;ynamide ligand, [(BDI)V{&#954;1&#8208;N&#8208;(Ad)NCC(tBu)}(OTf)] (1). Conversely, B reacts with C&#8801;NAd to generate a low&#8208;spin [VIII] diamagnetic complex having a chelated &#954;2&#8208;C,N&#8208;azaalleneyl ligand, [(dBDI)V{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(Ad)NCC(tBu)}] (2). Theoretical studies have been applied to better understand the mechanism of formation of 2 and the electronic reconfiguration upon structural rearrangement by the alteration of ligand denticity between 1 and 2.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Network Breakdown Boosts Selective CO2 Photoreduction by Suppressing H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we discover that breaking down the hydrogen bond network can suppress the H2 evolution side reaction in CO2 photoreduction, leading to improved CO production. We design a series of photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s as photocatalysts to study the effect of hydrogen bond network on CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CO rate and selectivity are 35.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 98.9&#8201;%, respectively, with no H2 detected.







Abstract
Conventional strategies for highly efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction focus on the design of catalysts and cocatalysts. In this study, we discover that hydrogen bond network breakdown in reaction system can suppress H2 evolution, thereby improving CO2 photoreduction performance. Photosensitive poly(ionic liquid)s are designed as photocatalysts owing to their strong hydrogen bonding with solvents. The hydrogen bond strength is tuned by solvent composition, thereby effectively regulating H2 evolution (from 0 to 12.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). No H2 is detected after hydrogen bond network breakdown with trichloromethane or tetrachloromethane as additives. CO production rate and selectivity increase to 35.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 98.9&#8201;% with trichloromethane, compared with 0.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 26.2&#8201;%, respectively, without trichloromethane. Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations confirm that trichloromethane broke the systemic hydrogen bond network and subsequently suppressed H2 evolution. This hydrogen bond network breakdown strategy may be extended to other catalytic reactions involving H2 evolution.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Characterization and Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease&#8208;Relevant Tau Aggregates in Human Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing MAPTau, a novel single&#8208;molecule approach for detailed analysis of tau aggregates in human brain and blood, offering unprecedented insights into the quantity, size, and phosphorylation profile of individual tau aggregates. By identifying distinctive Alzheimer's disease&#8208;specific tau aggregate morphologies and phosphorylation patterns, MAPTau opens new avenues for investigating disease mechanisms and novel diagnostic strategies.







Abstract
Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the protein tau play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the molecular structure of the filamentous tau aggregates has been determined to atomic resolution, there is far less information available about the smaller, soluble aggregates, which are believed to be more toxic. Traditional techniques are limited to bulk measures and struggle to identify individual aggregates in complex biological samples. To address this, we developed a novel single&#8208;molecule pull&#8208;down&#8208;based assay (MAPTau) to detect and characterize individual tau aggregates in AD and control post&#8208;mortem brain and biofluids. Using MAPTau, we report the quantity, as well as the size and circularity of tau aggregates measured using super&#8208;resolution microscopy, revealing AD&#8208;specific differences in tau aggregate morphology. By adapting MAPTau to detect multiple phosphorylation markers in individual aggregates using two&#8208;color coincidence detection, we derived compositional profiles of the individual aggregates. We find an AD&#8208;specific phosphorylation profile of tau aggregates with more than 80&#8201;% containing multiple phosphorylations, compared to 5&#8201;% in age&#8208;matched non&#8208;AD controls. Our results show that MAPTau is able to identify disease&#8208;specific subpopulations of tau aggregates phosphorylated at different sites, that are invisible to other methods and enable the study of disease mechanisms and diagnosis.

         <title>Asymmetric Pd/Organoboron&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Carbohydrate Functionalization with Alkoxyallenes Involving Noncovalent Stereocontrol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing synergistic asymmetric palladium and organoboron catalysis, a host of formidable site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and chemoselectivity challenges can be concomitantly addressed to precisely functionalize one out of multiple hydroxyl groups on a remarkable range of carbohydrate polyols. Mechanistic investigations unexpectedly revealed the pivotal stereocontrolling role of noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate the robustness of a synergistic chiral Pd/organoboron system in tackling a challenging suite of site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity issues across a considerable palette of biologically relevant carbohydrate polyols, when prochiral alkoxyallenes were employed as electrophiles. In view of the burgeoning role of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) in stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis, our mechanistic experiments and DFT modeling of the reaction path unexpectedly revealed that NCIs such as hydrogen bonding and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between the resting states of the Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl complex and the borinate saccharide are critically involved in the stereoselectivity control. Our strategy thus illuminates the untapped potential of harnessing NCIs in the context of transition metal catalysis to tackle stereoselectivity challenges in carbohydrate functionalization.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Migratory Hydrocyanation of Internal Alkenes: Expanding the Scope to &#945;,&#969;&#8208;Diaryl Internal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of internal alkenes involving a chain&#8208;walking process is reported. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and delivers benzylic nitriles in high yields. Even &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diaryl internal alkenes could be successfully converted to the desired products with good regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by modifying the electronic and steric effects.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed migratory functionalization of alkenes witnessed extensive development in the past few years. However, the asymmetric version of this reaction has remained largely underdeveloped owing to the difficulty in simultaneous control of both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. In addition, exploring the wider alkene substrate scope to enable more synthetically valuable applications represents another challenge in this field. In this context, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrocyanation of internal alkenes involving a chain&#8208;walking process is demonstrated. The reaction exhibits excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and delivers benzylic nitriles in high yields. Even &#945;,&#969;&#8208;diaryl internal alkenes, which are known to be one of the most challenging substrates of this type, could be successfully converted to the desired products with good regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity by modifying the electronic and steric effects. Theoretical calculations suggest that the &#951;3&#8208;benzyl coordination mode and the aryl substituent (3,5&#8208;(OMe)2C6H3) on the diphosphite ligand are both key factors in regulating regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes Fabricated on Flexible Polymer Supports for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy gives metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes with areas over 2,400&#8197;cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm). Three spiral wound membrane modules with an area of 4,800&#8197;cm2 were prepared. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).







Abstract
Ultrathin continuous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes have the potential to achieve high gas permeance and selectivity simultaneously for otherwise difficult gas separations, but with few exceptions for zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) membranes, current methods cannot conveniently realize practical large&#8208;area fabrication. Here, we propose a ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy for preparing large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes on flexible polymeric support layers. The bipolymer directs metal ions to form a cross&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network with a uniform distribution of metal ions on support layers. Ligand back diffusion controls the feed of ligand molecules available for nuclei formation, resulting in the continuous growth of large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes. We report the practical fabrication of three representative defect&#8208;free MOF membranes with areas larger than 2,400&#8197;cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm), including ZIFs and carboxylate&#8208;linker MOFs. Among these, the ZIF&#8208;8 membrane displays high gas permeance of 3,979&#8197;GPU for C3H6, with good mixed gas selectivity (43.88 for C3H6/C3H8). To illustrate its scale&#8208;up practicality, MOF membranes were prepared and incorporated into spiral&#8208;wound membrane modules with an active area of 4,800&#8197;cm2. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin continuous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes have the potential to achieve high gas permeance and selectivity simultaneously for otherwise difficult gas separations, but with few exceptions for zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) membranes, current methods cannot conveniently realize practical large-area fabrication. Here, we propose a ligand back diffusion-assisted bipolymer-directed metal ion distribution strategy for preparing large-area ultrathin MOF membranes on flexible polymeric support layers. The bipolymer directs metal ions to form a cross-linked two-dimensional (2D) network with a uniform distribution of metal ions on support layers. Ligand back diffusion controls the feed of ligand molecules available for nuclei formation, resulting in the continuous growth of large-area ultrathin MOF membranes. We report the practical fabrication of three representative defect-free MOF membranes with areas larger than 2,400&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm), including ZIFs and carboxylate-linker MOFs. Among these, the ZIF-8 membrane displays high gas permeance of 3,979&#8197;GPU for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, with good mixed gas selectivity (43.88 for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;). To illustrate its scale-up practicality, MOF membranes were prepared and incorporated into spiral-wound membrane modules with an active area of 4,800&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The ZIF-8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Palladium/Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Dienes for Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5&#8208;Nonadjacent Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic palladium/copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported for stereodivergent construction of 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. Mechanistic studies indicate a mechanism involving a Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost cascade. DFT calculations disclose that the palladium and copper catalysts separately control the newly formed stereocenters at C1 and C5.







Abstract
The construction of two distal stereocenters through a single catalytic process is of great interest in organic synthesis. While there are some successful reports regarding stereodivergent preparation of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;stereocenters, the more challenged 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters have never been achieved in a stereodivergent fashion. Herein we describe a synergistic palladium/copper catalysis for 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes, providing access to 1,5&#8208;nonadjacent quaternary stereocenters. Because each of the two catalysts separately controlled one of the newly formed stereocenters, stereodivergent synthesis of all four diastereomers of the products could readily be achieved simply by choosing an appropriate combination of chiral catalysts. Experimental and computational studies supported a mechanism involving a Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost cascade reaction, and the origins of the stereoselectivity were elucidated.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Supporting Atomic Bi&#8722;N2O2 Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation effect and interlayer coordination of Bi3+ ions result in an oriented variation of the exposed crystal plane and the slight lattice strain of the original hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, forming a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework for high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single atomic catalysts (SACs) offer a superior platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to obtain well&#8208;defined and novel site configuration owing to the uncertainty of functional framework&#8208;derived SACs through calcination. Herein, a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported directly for CO2RR. In flow cell, the target catalyst Bi1&#8208;HOF maintains a faradaic efficiency (FE) HCOOH of over 90&#8201;% at a wide potential window of 1.4&#8197;V. The corresponding partial current density ranges from 113.3 to 747.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. And, Bi1&#8208;HOF exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of over 30&#8197;h under a successive potential&#8208;step test with a current density of 100&#8211;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density function theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of HOF effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from Bi center to CO2 molecule, reaching an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. Besides, this study offers a versatile method to reach series of M&#8722;N2O2 sites with regulable metal centers via the same intercalation mechanism, broadening the platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during CO2RR.

         <title>Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin free&#8208;standing porous aromatic framework (PAF) membranes were prepared by liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization, and applied in the anion conduction for the first time, with excellent performance in hydroxide conductivity and stability due to the rational presence of transporting sites and rigid structure of PAF.







Abstract
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) show promising potential in anionic conduction due to their high stability and customizable functionality. However, the insolubility of most PAFs presents a significant challenge in their processing into membranes and subsequent applications. In this study, continuous PAF membranes with adjustable thickness were successfully created using liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization. The rigid backbone and the stable C&#8722;C coupling endow PAF membrane with superior chemical and dimensional stabilities over most conventional polymer membranes. Different quaternary ammonium functionalities were anchored to the backbone through flexible alkyl chains with tunable length. The optimal PAF membrane exhibited an OH&#8722; conductivity of 356.6&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. Additionally, the PAF membrane exhibited outstanding alkaline stability, retaining 95&#8201;% of its OH&#8722; conductivity after 1000&#8197;hours in 1&#8197;M NaOH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of PAF materials in anion exchange membranes, achieving the highest OH&#8722; conductivity and exceptional chemical/dimensional stability. This work provides the possibility for the potential of PAF materials in anionic conductive membranes.

         <title>A Tag&#8208;Free Platform for Synthesis and Screening of Cyclic Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The platform PEPTIC for cyclic peptide drug discovery offers a tag&#8208;free workflow for the synthesis, sequencing, and identification of cyclic peptide binders. This innovative approach enables the generation of diverse cyclic peptide libraries, as well as facile linearization and decoding of cyclic peptide binder sequences, and is expected to expedite the discovery of novel cyclic peptide binders of biological targets.







Abstract
In the realm of high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS), macrocyclic peptide libraries traditionally necessitate decoding tags, essential for both library synthesis and identifying hit peptide sequences post&#8208;screening. Our innovation introduces a tag&#8208;free technology platform for synthesizing cyclic peptide libraries in solution and facilitates screening against biological targets to identify peptide binders through unconventional intramolecular CyClick and DeClick chemistries (CCDC) discovered through our research. This combination allows for the synthesis of diverse cyclic peptide libraries, the incorporation of various amino acids, and facile linearization and decoding of cyclic peptide binder sequences. Our sensitivity&#8208;enhancing derivatization method, utilized in tandem with nano LC&#8208;MS/MS, enables the sequencing of peptides even at exceedingly low picomolar concentrations. Employing our technology platform, we have successfully unearthed novel cyclic peptide binders against a monoclonal antibody and the first cyclic peptide binder of HIV capsid protein responsible for viral infections as validated by microscale thermal shift assays (TSA), biolayer interferometry (BLI) and functional assays.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Euphorbia Diterpenoid Pepluacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic utilization of a Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade reaction, a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/cyclopropanation protocol, and a transannular C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion/Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation/ring&#8208;opening sequence enabled the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208; and (+)&#8208;pepluacetal. The synthesis also features the control of concave&#8208;face bond formation and the application of a remote traceless stereochemical relay strategy.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of the Euphorbia diterpenoid pepluacetal is disclosed in both racemic and chiral fashions. The synthesis strategically relies on a photo&#8208;induced Wolff rearrangement/lactonization cascade (WRLC) reaction to access the cyclobutane moiety, a ring&#8208;closing metathesis/cyclopropanation sequence to rapidly forge the 7&#8211;3&#8197;bicyclic system, and a late&#8208;stage Rh&#8208;catalyzed transannular carbenoid insertion to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond followed by a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation and ring&#8208;opening manipulations to install the side chain. The synthetic route demonstrates excellent stereochemical control on the non&#8208;classical concave&#8208;face bond formation, remote traceless stereochemical relay and high scalability to provide 20&#8197;mg of (+)&#8208;pepluacetal.

         <title>Chelating Additive Regulating Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry for Highly Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two carbonyl groups of N&#8208;ac (N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;caprolactam) chelating additive could coordinate with Zn2+ to maximally reduce the water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths, thereby greatly inhibited water induced side&#8208;reactions and HER. Moreover, the N&#8208;ac additive can also preferentially adsorb on Zn (002) facets, thereby promote the highly reversible Zn2+ deposition and led to dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) usually suffered from poor reversibility and limited lifespan because of serious water induced side&#8208;reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and rampant zinc (Zn) dendrite growth. Reducing the content of water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths can effectively suppress those inherent defects of AZMBs. In this work, we originally discovered that the two carbonyl groups of N&#8208;Acetyl&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;caprolactam (N&#8208;ac) chelating ligand can serve as dual solvation sites to coordinate with Zn2+, thereby minimizing water molecules within Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheaths, and greatly inhibit water&#8208;induced side&#8208;reactions and HER. Moreover, the N&#8208;ac chelating additive can form a unique physical barrier interface on Zn surface, preventing the harmful contacting with water. In addition, the preferential adsorption of N&#8208;ac on Zn (002) facets can promote highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn2+ deposition. As a result, Zn//Cu half&#8208;cell within N&#8208;ac added electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;high 99.89&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency during 8000&#8197;cycles. Zn//Zn symmetric cells also demonstrated unprecedented long life of more than 9800&#8197;hours (over one year). Aqueous Zn//ZnV6O16&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H2O (Zn//ZVO) full&#8208;cell preserved 78&#8201;% capacity even after ultra&#8208;long 2000&#8197;cycles. A more practical pouch&#8208;cell was also obtained (90.2&#8201;% capacity after 100&#8197;cycles). This method offers a promising strategy for accelerating the development of highly efficient AZMBs.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Vicinal Diols through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Allylation of Ketones with Siloxypropadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted vicinal diols is accomplished by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective and enantioselective reductive allylation of ketones with siloxypropadienes. The generation of both syn&#8208;diols and anti&#8208;diols is rationalized by DFT calculations, which show that cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;siloxy&#8208;allyl copper species are generated favorably in the reduction of either 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene or 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene by copper hydride species.







Abstract
Chiral trisubstituted vicinal diols are a type of important organic compounds, serving as both common structure units in bioactive natural products and chiral auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, by using siloxypropadienes as the precursors of allyl copper(I) species, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective and enantioselective reductive allylation of ketones was achieved, providing both syn&#8208;diols and anti&#8208;diols in good to excellent enantioselectivity. DFT calculations show that cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;siloxy&#8208;allyl copper species are generated favorably with either 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene or 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene. Moreover, the steric difference of TBS group and TIPS group distinguishes the face selectivity of acetophenone, leading to syn&#8208;selectivity for 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene and anti&#8208;selectivity for 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene. Easy transformations of the products were performed, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the present method. Moreover, one chiral diol prepared in the above transformations was used as a suitable organocatalyst for the catalytic asymmetric reductive self&#8208;coupling of aldimines generated in situ with B2(neo)2.

         <title>A Sensitive Technique Unravels the Kinetics of Activation and Trans&#8208;Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method enables kinetic studies of the binding (kobs, kon, koff, and Kd) and trans&#8208;cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems, which reveals that once the crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is activated by its binding with the RNA activator, the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas13a is sustained over a broad temperature range (7&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C). Cas13a at the ambient temperature is useful for transcriptomic and diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Activation of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system requires the formation of a crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and the binding of an RNA activator to the RNP. These two binding processes play a crucial role in the performance of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system. However, the binding kinetics remain poorly understood, and a main challenge is the lack of a sensitive method for real&#8208;time measurements of the dynamically formed active CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a enzyme. We describe here a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding between Cas13a and its activator. The method is able to unravel and quantify the kinetics of binding and cleavage separately, on the basis of measuring the real&#8208;time trans&#8208;cleavage rates of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system and obtaining the real&#8208;time concentrations of the active CRISPR&#8208;Cas ternary complex. We further discovered that once activated, the Cas13a system operates at a wide range of temperatures (7&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C) with fast trans&#8208;cleavage kinetics. The new method and findings are important for diverse applications of the Cas13a system, such as the demonstrated quantification of microRNA at ambient temperatures (e.g., 25&#8201;&#176;C).

A sufficiently reactive intermediate for chemi&#8208;excitation was obtained by reduction of Ir(ppy)3, providing a multi&#8208;colour ECL system in which the ratio of the two spectrally distinct emissions can be controlled through the applied potential.







Abstract
We report the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of a 3d6 Cr(0) complex ([Cr(LMes)3]; &#955;em=735&#8197;nm) with comparable photophysical properties to those of ECL&#8208;active complexes of 4d6 or 5d6 precious metal ions. The electrochemical potentials of [Cr(LMes)3] are more negative than those of [Ir(ppy)3] and render the [Cr(LMes)3]* excited state inaccessible through conventional co&#8208;reactant ECL with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine or oxalate. ECL can be obtained, however, through the annihilation route in which potentials sufficient to oxidise and reduce the luminophore are alternately applied. When combined with [Ir(ppy)3] (&#955;em=520&#8197;nm), the annihilation ECL of [Cr(LMes)3] was greatly enhanced whereas that of [Ir(ppy)3] was diminished. Under appropriate conditions, the relative intensities of the two spectrally distinct emissions can be controlled through the applied potentials. From this starting point for ECL with 3d6 metal complexes, we discuss some directions for future development.

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral Agent Enables One&#8208;pot Spontaneous Deracemization of Racemic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization method using a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) was developed. The BCA helps achieve the dual functions of catalytic racemization and cocrystallization with the resulting enantiomers (see picture). This method was successfully implemented for the deracemization of chiral drugs containing one or multiple stereocenters, thus extending current strategies to the enantioseparation of racemic compounds.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot deracemization method using a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) is proposed for the first time to convert a racemate to the desired enantiomer. Specifically, chiral &#945;, (&#945;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinemethanol) formed enantiospecific cocrystals with racemic dihydromyricetin, and used its own alkaline catalysis to catalyze the racemization between the (2R,3R)&#8208;enantiomer and (2S,3S)&#8208;enantiomer in solution, achieving a one&#8208;pot spontaneous deracemization. This strategy was also successfully extended to the deracemization of three other racemic compound drugs: (R,S)&#8208;carprofen, (R,S)&#8208;indoprofen, and (R,S)&#8208;indobufen. The one&#8208;pot deracemization method based on the BCA strategy provides a feasible approach to address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reactions that are commonly encountered in the cocrystallization&#8208;induced deracemization process and opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products with atom economy.

         <title>Effective C4 Separation by Zeolite Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;supported zeolite CGC membranes were fabricated by incorporating zeolites as fillers within the agZIF&#8208;62 matrix. There was excellent compatibility between two microporous phases through the formation of interfacial bonds, ensuring efficient separation of C4H6/C4 hydrocarbon gases. The strategy of combining zeolite with agZIF&#8208;62 reduces the catalysis of olefin gas and facilitates the stable separation process.







Abstract
Inorganic zeolites have excellent molecular sieving properties, but they are difficult to process into macroscopic structures. In this work, we use metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass as substrates to engineer the interface with inorganic zeolites, and then assemble the discrete crystalline zeolite powders into monolithic structures. The zeolites are well dispersed and stabilized within the MOF glass matrix, and the monolith has satisfactory mechanical stabilities for membrane applications. We demonstrate the effective separation performance of the membrane for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) from other C4 hydrocarbons, which is a crucial and challenging separation in the chemical industry. The membrane achieves a high permeance of C4H6 (693.00&#177;21.83&#8197;GPU) and a high selectivity over n&#8208;butene, n&#8208;butane, isobutene, and isobutane (9.72, 9.94, 10.31, and 11.94, respectively). This strategy opens up new possibilities for developing advanced membrane materials for difficult hydrocarbon separations.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;chiral Nonlinear Optical Effect with Large Anisotropic Response in Two&#8208;Dimensional Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient discrimination and generation of circularly polarized light through nonlinear optical responses are achieved by dominant contribution of magnetic dipole (MD) transitions in two&#8208;dimensional perovskite. This study not only contributes to the advancement of our comprehension of chiral nonlinear optics in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites but also showcases the advantageous potential in optical quantum information devices.







Abstract
The chiral organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are vital candidates for superior nonlinear optical (NLO) effects associated with circularly polarized (CP) light. NLO in chiral materials often couples with magnetic dipole (MD) transition, as well as the conventional electric dipole (ED) transition. However, the importance of MD transition in NLO process of chiral OIHPs has not yet been well recognized. Here, the circular polarized probe analysis of second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) provides the direct evidence that the contribution of MD leads to a large anisotropic response to CP lights in chiral OIHPs, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBACl)2PbI4. The thin films exhibit great sensitivity to CP lights over a wide wavelength range, and the g&#8208;value reaches up to 1.57 at the wavelength where the contribution of MD is maximized. Furthermore, it is also effective as CP light generator, outputting CP&#8208;SHG with maximum g&#8208;factor of 1.76 upon the stimulation of linearly polarized light. This study deepens the understanding of relation between chirality and magneto&#8208;optical effect, and such an efficient discrimination and generation of CP light signal is highly applicable for chirality&#8208;based sensor and optical communication devices.

         <title>Constructing &#960;&#8211;&#960; Superposition Effect of Tetralithium Naphthalenetetracarboxylate with Electron Delocalization for Robust Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductive network composites i.e. carbon nanotubes interwoven tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate achieve great lithium&#8208;ion storage performance due to the multiple conjugated carboxyls, great electron delocalization in naphthalene and extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect from the interface.







Abstract
Organics are gaining significance as electrode materials due to their merits of multi&#8208;electron reaction sites, flexible rearrangeable structures and redox reversibility. However, organics encounter finite electronic conductivity and inferior durability especially in organic electrolytes. To circumvent above barriers, we propose a novel design strategy, constructing conductive network structures with extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect by manipulating intermolecular interaction. Tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate (LNTC) interwoven by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forms LNTC@CNTs composite firstly for Li&#8208;ion storage, where multiple conjugated carboxyls contribute sufficient Li&#8208;ion storage sites, the unique network feature enables electrolyte and charge mobility conveniently combining electron delocalization in &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect between LNTC and CNTs endows laudable structural robustness. Accordingly, LNTC@CNTs maintain an excellent Li&#8208;ion storage capacity retention of 96.4&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles. Electrochemical experiments and theoretical simulations elucidate the fast reaction kinetics and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage stability owing to the electron delocalization and &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect, while conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates during charging/discharging. Consequently, a dual&#8208;ion battery combining this composite anode and expanded graphite cathode exhibits a peak specific capacity of 122&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long cycling life with a capacity retention of 84.2&#8201;% after 900&#8197;cycles.

Consequently, a dual-ion battery combining this composite anode and expanded graphite cathode exhibits a peak specific capacity of 122&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and long cycling life with a capacity retention of 84.2&#8201;% after 900&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering a Dual&#8208;Functionalized PolyHIPE Resin for Photobiocatalytic Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyHIPE (high internal phase emulsion) resin served as a solid support system for both a halogenase enzyme and a benzothiadiazole (BTZ) photosensitizer. It was then used in a continuous flow system for the electrophilic bromination of aromatic substrates. This support offers excellent single pass and recirculation yields. It is stable and reusable and allows for straightforward product separation owing to its heterogeneous nature.







Abstract
The use of a dual resin for photobiocatalysis, encompassing both a photocatalyst and an immobilized enzyme, brings several challenges, including effective immobilization, maintaining photocatalyst and enzyme activity and ensuring sufficient light penetration. However, the benefits, such as integrated processes, reusability, easier product separation, and potential for scalability, can outweigh these challenges, making dual resin systems promising for efficient and sustainable photobiocatalytic applications. In this study, we employed a photosensitizer&#8208;containing porous emulsion&#8208;templated polymer as a functional support that is used to covalently anchor a chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO). We demonstrate the versatility of this heterogeneous photobiocatalytic material, which enables the bromination of four aromatic substrates, including rutin&#8212;a natural occurring flavonol&#8212;under blue light (456&#8197;nm) irradiation and continuous flow conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate in a NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O Ternary Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glut in NH3 production has resulted in a heavily imbalanced N&#8208;cycle causing massive accumulation of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in our ecosystems, destroying the environment. Upcycling these Nr via electrochemical conversion into NH3 can partially close the N&#8208;cycle and reduce reliance on the carbon&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosh process. Here we report the remarkable performance of a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni catalyst at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
A glut of dinitrogen&#8208;derived ammonia (NH3) over the past century has resulted in a heavily imbalanced nitrogen cycle and consequently, the large&#8208;scale accumulation of reactive nitrogen such as nitrates in our ecosystems has led to detrimental environmental issues. Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste nitrogen back into NH3 holds promise in mitigating these environmental impacts and reducing reliance on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance electrolyzer using an ultrahigh alkalinity electrolyte, NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O, for low&#8208;cost NH3 electrosynthesis. At 3,000&#8197;mA/cm2, the device with a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst achieves an unprecedented faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5&#177;1.5&#8201;% under a low cell voltage of 3.83&#8197;V; whereas at 1,000&#8197;mA/cm2, an FE of 96.5&#177;4.8&#8201;% under a cell voltage of only 2.40&#8197;V was achieved. Techno&#8208;economic analysis revealed that our device cuts the levelized cost of ammonia electrosynthesis by ~40&#8201;% ($30.68 for Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni vs. $48.53 for Ni foam per kmol&#8208;NH3). The NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O electrolyte together with the Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst can enable the high&#8208;throughput nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia applications for affordable and scalable real&#8208;world wastewater treatments.

         <title>A Dicopper(II)&#8208;Based Carbonic Anhydrase Model &#8208; Quantum&#8208;Chemical Evaluation of the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyanobacterium Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of different species of colonial ascidians, occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, produces a variety of cyclic peptides. These patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles lead to relatively stable dicopper(II) complexes that are extremely efficient carbonic anhydrase mimics, the most active model systems known so far. Importantly, it recently was shown that copper(II) is coordinated to patellamide derivatives in Prochloron cells. An interesting question therefore is, whether the biological function of patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles is related to the catalytic activity in CO2 hydration or its reverse. Here, we present a computational study to evaluate the energetics of the catalytic cycle in search of a possible answer to these questions and compare the computed energy barriers with the experimental kinetic data. It emerges that release of the bridging carbonate is a critical step and that the catalysis product inhibits catalysis at pH values above approx. 7. Therefore, carbonate transport rather than CO2 hydrolysis is proposed as the biological function of copper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes in the Prochloron&#8208;Ascidian symbiosis.</dc:description>

         <title>SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S &#8208; DABB Proteins Catalyzing Enantiospecific Hydrolysis of Organosilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silyl ethers fulfil a fundamental role in synthetic organic chemistry as protecting groups and their selective cleavage is an important factor in their application. We present here for the first time two enzymes, SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S, which are able to hydrolyze silyl ethers. They belong to the stress&#8208;response A/B barrel&#160;domain (DABB) family and are able to cleave the Si&#8208;O bond with opposite enantiopreference. Silyl ethers containing aromatic, cyclic or aliphatic alcohols and, depending on the alcohol moiety, silyl functions as large as TBDMS are accepted. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of SilE&#8208;R, determined to a resolution of 1.98 &#550;, in combination with mutational studies, revealed an active site featuring two histidine residues, H8 and H79, which likely act synergistically as nucleophile and Br&#248;nsted base in the hydrolytic mechanism, which has not previously been described for enzymes. Although the natural function of SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S is unknown, we propose that these &#8216;silyl etherases&#8217; may have significant potential for synthetic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging High&#8208;Pressure Syngas Metal Catalysis and Biocatalysis in Tandem One&#8208;Pot Processes for the Synthesis of Non&#8208;chiral and Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While simultaneously proceeding reactions are among the most fascinating features of biosynthesis, this concept of tandem processes also offers high potential in the chemical industry in terms of less waste production and improved process efficiency and sustainability. Although examples of one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic syntheses exist, the combination of completely different reaction types is rare. In this work, we demonstrate that extreme &#8220;antipodes&#8220; of the &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221; such as syngas&#8208;based high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation and biocatalyzed reduction can be combined within a tandem&#8209;type one&#8208;pot process in water, which both play an outstanding role as individual reactions. No significant deactivation was found for either the biocatalyst or the chemocatalyst. A proof&#8209;of&#8209;concept for the one&#8208;pot process starting from 1&#8208;octene was established with &gt;99% conversion and 80% isolated yield of the desired alcohol isomers. All necessary components for hydroformylation and biocatalysis were added to the reactor from the beginning. This concept has been extended to chiral products by conducting the hydroformylation of styrene and an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution in a tandem mode, leading to an excellent conversion of &gt;99% and an enantiomeric ratio of 91:9 to (S)&#8209;2&#8208;phenylpropanol. The overall process runs in water under mild and energy&#8208;saving conditions, without any need for intermediate isolation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultrahigh Porosity for High&#8208;temperature and High&#8208;humidity Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is a newly synthesized all&#8208;inorganic zeolitic material and has been used for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Herein, a new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide was synthesized and characterized. The porous framework was established through the assembly of [P2Mo13O50] clusters with PO4 linkers. Guest molecules occupied the framework, which could be removed through heat treatment, thereby opening the micropores. The pore characteristics were controlled by the cations within the micropore, enabling the adjustment of the interactions with alkynes and alkenes. This resulted in good separation performance of ethylene/acetylene and propylene/propyne even under high temperature and humidity conditions. The high stability of the material enabled the efficient recovery and reuse without discernible loss in the separation performance. Due to the relatively weak interaction between the adsorbed alkyne and the framework, the adsorbent facilitated the recovery of a highly pure alkyne. This feature enhances the practical applicability of the material in various industrial processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating Sodium Ordering for Enhanced Solid Solution Behavior in Layered NaNiO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The O&#8208;type layered nickel oxides suffer from undesired co&#8208;operative Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion stemming from Ni3+ ions and undergo multiple biphasic structural transformations during the insertion/extraction of large Na+ ions, posing a significant challenge to stabilize the structural integrity. We present here a systematic investigation of the impact of substituting 5% divalent (Mg2+) or trivalent (Al3+ or Co3+) ions for Ni3+ to alleviate Na+&#8208;ion ordering and perturb the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect to enhance structural stability. We gauge a fundamental understanding of the Mg&#8208;O and Na&#8208;O or Mg&#8208;O&#8208;Na bonding interactions, noting that the ionicity of the Mg&#8208;O bond deshields the electronic cloud of oxygen from Na+ ions. Furthermore, calculations of the Van Vleck distortion modes reveal a relaxation of NiO6 octahedra from Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and a reduced electron density at the interlayer with Mg2+ substitution. Long&#8208;range (operando X&#8208;ray diffraction) and short&#8208;range (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) structural analyses provide insights into reduced ordering, allowing a stable continuous solid solution. Overall, Mg&#8208;substitution results in a high&#8208;capacity retention of ~ 96% even after 100 cycles, showcasing the potential of this strategy for overcoming the structural instabilities and enhancing the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;&#8208;OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron&#8208;deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA in water via SNAr chemistry. In particular, trialkyl&#8208;ammonium (TAA)&#8208;activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8208;3 h. Remarkably, a TAA triazine previously used only for reaction with carboxylic acids, shows unprecedented selectivity for RNA over water, reacting rapidly with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups while exhibiting a half&#8208;life in water of &gt;10 days. We further show that a triazine aryl species can be used as a probe at trace&#8208;level yields to map RNA structure in vitro. Finally, we prepare a number of functionalized trialkylammonium triazine reagents and show that they can be used to covalently label RNA efficiently for use in vitro and in living cells. This direct arylation chemistry offers a simple and distinct structural scaffold for post&#8208;synthetic RNA modification, with the potential for utility in multiple applications in transcriptome research.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Rotational Polyanion Coupling Enables Fast Li Ion Dynamics in Tetrafluoroborate Ion Doped Antiperovskite Li2OHCl Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich antiperovskite (LiRAP) hydroxyhalides are emerging as attractive solid electrolyte (SEs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) due to their low melting point, low cost, and ease of scaling&#8208;up. The incorporation of rotational polyanions can reduce the activation energy and thus improve the Li ion conductivity of SEs. Herein, we propose a ternary rotational polyanion coupling strategy to fasten the Li ion conduction in tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8211;) ion doped LiRAP Li2OHCl. Assisted by first&#8208;principles calculation, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state magnetic resonance and electrochemical impedance spectra, it is confirmed that Li ion transport in BF4&#8211; ion doped Li2OHCl is strongly associated with the rotational coupling among OH&#8211;, BF4&#8211; and Li2&#8211;O&#8211;H octahedrons, which enhances the Li ion conductivity for more than 1.8 times with the activation energy lowering 0.03 eV. This work provides a new perspective to design high&#8208;performance superionic conductors with multi&#8208;polyanions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Foldamer is a scaled&#8208;down version of coil spring, which can absorb and release energy by conformational change. Here, polymer networks with high&#8208;density of molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based foldamers as the monomer. The coiling of the foldamer is controlled by oligourea ligands coordinating to chloride ions; subsequently, the folding and unfolding of foldamer conformations endow the polymer network with excellent energy dissipation and toughness. The mechanical performance of the corresponding polymer network shows a dramatic increase from P&#8208;L2UCl (non&#8208;folding), P&#8208;L4UCl (a full turn) to P&#8208;L6UCl (1.5 turns), in terms of strength (2.62 MPa; 14.26 Mpa; 22.93 Mpa), elongation at break (70%; 325%; 352%), Young&#8217;s modulus (2.69 MPa; 63.61 Mpa; 141.50 Mpa), and toughness (1.12 MJ/m3; 21.39 MJ/m3; 49.62 MJ/m3), respectively, which are also better than those without anion centers and the non&#8208;foldamer based counterparts.&#160;Moreover, P&#8208;L6UCl shows enhanced strength and toughness than most of the molecular&#8208;spring based polymer networks.Moreover, P&#8208;L6UCl shows enhanced strength and toughness than most of the molecular&#8208;spring based polymer networks.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with a Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Topology and High Electrical Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrically conducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest due to their remarkable structural tunability and outstanding electrical properties. However, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials face challenges due to the limited availability of specific ligands and pore structures. In this study, we have employed a novel highly branched D3h symmetrical planar conjugated ligand, dodechydroxylhexabenzotrinaphthylene (DHHBTN) to fabricate a series of 2D conductive MOFs, named M&#8208;DHHBTN (M = Co, Ni, and Cu). This new family of MOFs offers two distinct types of pores, elevating the structural complexity of 2D conductive MOFs to a more advanced level. The intricate tessellation patterns of the M&#8208;DHHBTN are elucidated through comprehensive analyses involving powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical simulations, and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope. Optical&#8208;pump terahertz&#8208;probe spectroscopic measurements unveiled carrier mobility in DHHBTN&#8208;based 2D MOFs spanning from 0.69 to 3.10 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. Among M&#8208;DHHBTN famility, Cu&#8208;DHHBTN displayed high electrical conductivity reaching 0.21 S cm&#8722;1 at 298 K with thermal activation behavior. This work leverages the &#8220;branched conjugation&#8221; of the ligand to encode heteroporosity into highly conductive 2D MOFs, underscoring the significant potential of heterogeneous double&#8208;pore structures for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of Halide Methyltransferase BxHMT through Dynamic Cross&#8208;correlation Network Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles such as methyl iodide (MeI) or methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). Compared with MeI, the cost&#8208;effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessible directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. Herein, we developed a dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the enzyme&#8217;s catalytic efficiency, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from Paraburkholderia xenovorans. Finally, the optimal mutant, M4 (V55T/C125S/L127T/L129P), exhibited remarkable improvements, with a specific activity of 4.08 U/mg towards MeOTs, representing an 82&#8208;fold increase compared to the wild&#8208;type (WT). Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work not only contributes promising biocatalyst for the regeneration of SAM, but also offers a strategy for efficient enzyme engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Radical Functionalization of Aldehydes Enabled by a Redox Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminocatalysis is a well&#8208;established tool that enables the production of enantioenriched compounds under mild conditions. Its versatility is underscored by its seamless integration with various synthetic approaches. While the combination of aminocatalysis with metal catalysis, photochemistry, and stoichiometric oxidants has been extensively explored, its synergy with electrochemical activation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present the successful merger of electrochemistry and aminocatalysis to perform SOMO&#8208;type transformations, expanding the toolkit for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. The methodology harnesses electricity to drive the oxidation of catalytically generated enamines, which ultimately partake in enantioselective radical processes, leading to &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes. Crucially, mechanistic studies highlight how this electrochemical strategy is enabled by the use of a redox shuttle, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl, to prevent catalyst degradation and furnishing the coveted compounds in good yield and high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;based Small Molecular Donor with Multiple Conformation Locks for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.3%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary organic solar cells (T&#8208;OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high&#8208;performance T&#8208;OSCs incorporates well&#8208;established Y&#8208;acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T&#8208;OSCs. This innovative molecule comprises ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine as the end group, with the EDOT unit facilitating the creation of multiple conformation locks. Consequently, the EDOT&#8208;based molecule exhibits two&#8208;dimensional charge transport, distinguishing it from the thiophene&#8208;bridged small molecule, which displays fewer conformation locks and provides one&#8208;dimensional charge transport. Furthermore, the robust electron&#8208;donating nature of EDOT imparts the small molecule with cascade energy levels relative to the electron donor and acceptor. As a result, OSCs incorporating the EDOT&#8208;based small molecule as the third component demonstrate enhanced mobilities, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 19.3%, surpassing the efficiency of 18.7% observed for OSCs incorporating thiophene&#8208;based small molecule as the third component. The investigations in this study underscore the excellence of EDOT as a building block for constructing conjugated materials with multiple conformation locks and high charge carrier mobilities, thereby contributing to elevated photovoltaic performance in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;(sulfonio)sulfilimine reagents: Non&#8208;oxidizing Sources of Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom for Skeletal Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#955;4&#8208;dibenzothiophen&#8208;5&#8208;imino&#8208;N&#8208;dibenzothiophenium triflate (1) in multigram scale is reported. This compound reacts with Rh2(esp)2 (esp = &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedipropionic acid) generating a Rh&#8208;coordinated sulfonitrene species, which is able to transfer the electrophilic nitrene moiety to olefins. When indenes are used as substrates, isoquinolines are obtained in good yields. We assumed that after formation of the corresponding N&#8208;sulfonio aziridine, a ring expansion occurs via selective C&#8208;C bond cleavage and concomitant elimination of dibenzothiophene. Unexpectedly, a similar protocol transforms 1&#8208;arylcyclobutenes into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes. Our calculations indicate that aziridination is not favored in this case; instead, sulfilimine&#8208;substituted cyclobutyl carbocations are initially formed, and these evolve to the isolated cyclopropanes via ring contraction. Both procedures are operationally simple, tolerate a range of functional groups, including oxidation&#8208;sensitive alcohols and aldehydes, and enable the convenient preparation of valuable 15N&#8208;labelled products. These results demonstrate the potential of 1 to provide alternative pathways for the selective transfer of N&#8208;atoms in organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Ethers to Mitigate Electrode Surface Reactivity in High&#8208;Voltage NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel (Ni)&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes exhibit twice the energy density of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their lifespan is limited by severe side reactions caused by high electrode reactivity. Fluorinated solvent&#8208;based electrolytes can address this challenge, but they pose environmental and biological hazards. This work reports on the molecular engineering of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers to mitigate electrode surface reactivity in high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich LMBs. By merely extending the alkyl chains of traditional ethers, we effectively reduce the catalytic reactivity of the cathode towards the electrolyte at high voltages, which suppresses the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte, microstructural defects and rock&#8208;salt phase formation in the cathode, and gas release issues. The high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich NCM811&#8208;Li battery delivers capacity retention of 80% after 250 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85%, even superior to that in carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, this strategy facilitates passivation of the Li anode by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, boosting the Li reversibility to 99.11% with a cycling life of 350 cycles, which outperforms conventional F&#8208;free ether electrolytes. Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100% and 500% compared to those in conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively.</dc:description>

Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100% and 500% compared to those in conventional carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Radical Aromatic C&#8211;H Functionalization of Alloxazine and Flavin through Ground&#8208;State Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavins and their alloxazine isomers are key chemical scaffolds for bioinspired electron transfer strategies. Their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by functional groups, which must be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis as their aromatic ring is inert towards post&#8208;functionalization. We show that the introduction of a remote metal&#8208;binding redox site on alloxazine and flavin activates their aromatic ring towards direct C&#8211;H functionalization. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a synthetic sequence involving ground state single electron transfer (SET) with an electrophilic source followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling. This unprecedented reactivity opens new opportunities in molecular editing of flavins by direct aromatic post&#8208;functionalization and the utility of the method is demonstrated with the site&#8208;selective C6 functionalization of alloxazine and flavin with a CF3 group, Br or Cl, that can be further elaborated into OH and aryl for chemical diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Crucial Chemical Processing Parameters Influencing the Performance of Solution&#8208;processed Inorganic Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Production of thermoelectric materials from solution&#8208;processed particles involves the synthesis of particles, their purification and densification into pelletized material. Chemical changes that occur during each one of these steps render them performance determining. Particularly the purification steps, bypassed in conventional solid&#8208;state synthesis, are the cause for large discrepancies among similar solution&#8208;processed materials. In present work, the investigation focuses on a water&#8208;based surfactant free solution synthesis of SnSe, a highly relevant thermoelectric material. We show and rationalize that the number of leaching steps, purification solvent, annealing, and annealing atmosphere have significant influence on the Sn:Se ratio and impurity content in the powder. Such compositional changes that are undetectable by conventional characterization techniques lead to distinct consolidated materials with different types and concentration of defects. Additionally, the profound effect on their transport properties is demonstrated. We emphasize that understanding the chemistry and identifying key chemical species and their role throughout the process is paramount for optimizing material performance. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive reporting of these steps as a standard practice to ensure material reproducibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Complex&#8208;Templated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry for the Selection and Identification of Homo&#8208;PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) leverages a reversible reaction to generate compound libraries from constituting building blocks under thermodynamic control. The position of this equilibrium can be biased by addition of a target macromolecule towards enrichment of bound ligands. While DCC has been applied to select ligands for a single target protein, its application to identifying chimeric molecules inducing proximity between two proteins is unprecedented. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we develop a DCC approach to select bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) based on their ability to stabilize the ternary complex. We focus on VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs as model system, and show that the formation of a VHL2:Homo&#8208;PROTAC ternary complex reversibly assembled using thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry leads to amplification of potent VHL Homo&#8208;PROTACs with degradation activities which correlated well with their biophysical ability to dimerize VHL. Ternary complex templated dynamic combinatorial libraries allowed identification of novel Homo&#8208;PROTAC degraders. We anticipate future applications of ternary&#8208;complex directed DCC to early PROTAC screenings and expansion to other proximity&#8208;inducing modalities beyond PROTACs.</dc:description>
