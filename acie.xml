         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top&#8208;down reconstruction of a Ni&#8208;based MOF yields ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional, defect&#8208;rich Ni hydroxides. In situ studies unveil pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;driven phase transitions to active NiOOH species. In situ XAS reveals dynamic Ni&#9472;O bond evolution and reversible Ni2+/Ni3+ redox states. DFT supports an adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism via exposed Ni2+ centers.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness &#8764; 1.5&#8211;2.6&#160;nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA.cm&#8722;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#9472;O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89&#160;&#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Evolution of CoxNiy Alloy Electronic Structure Buffered by Carbon Nanolayer to Tune Selective Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of electronic structure and its critical role for non&#8208;radical ROS generation via PMS was first investigated by carbon nanolayer&#8208;supported CoxNiy alloys (CoxNiy@CNT) with preset atomic Ni/Co ratio. The carbon nanolayer, as formed in situ with controllable lattice distance, exhibits the unique electron buffering effect to replenish or accept electron to CoxNiy, thereby driving selective generation of surface PMS* or free 1O2.








Abstract
Generation of non&#8208;radical reactive oxygen species (ROS) via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is desired to drive selective Fenton&#8208;like reactions and strongly affected by the electronic structure of catalyst. While the static structure&#8211;activity relationship of catalysts is well explored, how the evolution of electronic structure dynamically affects the ROS generation remains poorly understood. This study fabricated carbon nanolayer&#8208;supported CoxNiy alloys (CoxNiy@CNT) with preset atomic Ni/Co ratio (x/y&#160;=&#160;1:3, 2:2, 3:1) to probe the dynamic evolution of electronic structure and its subsequent role for the generation of non&#8208;radical ROS. During catalytic PMS activation, the paired electrons of O 2p in PMS fill the corresponding hybrid orbitals of Co to form coordinative Co&#8212;O endowed with paired/unpaired electrons. The carbon nanolayer support, as in situ formed with controllable lattice distance, exhibits the unique electron buffering effect to replenish electron to Co1Ni3 or accept electron from Co3Ni1, thereby driving selective generation of surface PMS* or free 1O2 respectively. Further, the specific reaction preferences of PMS* and 1O2 toward different organic contaminants were elucidated, and a combined process integrating both alloys was proposed to efficiently treat actual hospital wastewater. Overall, this study offers a molecule&#8208;level design of bimetallic alloys with tunable electronic structure for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Electronic Cloud Topology&#8208;Driven Electrostatic Decoupling: To Suppress High&#8208;Voltage Parasitic Reactions of Phosphate Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital coupling induces coupled redox behavior, causing structural changes and triggering parasitic self&#8208;reduction and high&#8208;voltage irreversibility. The electrostatic field decoupling strategy modulates TM&#9472;O bond covalency with electron cloud distribution, adjusts the V t2g&#8211;Mn eg orbital gap, expands the Mn/V redox window, suppresses coupled reactions, and activates high&#8208;voltage Mn4+/3+ and V5+/4+ redox pairs. As a result, the NMVTP cathode achieves high reversible capacity, surpassing the two&#8208;electron transfer limit.








Abstract
The polyanionic structure cathodes with synergistic Mn/V redox couples enables high&#8208;voltage platform and delivers considerable theoretical energy density in sodium&#8208;ion battery. However, achieving stable and reversible high&#8208;voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high&#8208;voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t2g state of V and the eg state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na3.5MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high&#8208;voltage Mn4+/3+ and V5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. This strategy opens new paths for developing high&#8208;energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.

         <title>Tailoring Lattice Oxygen Redox and Robust Structure Stability in High&#8208;Entropy Superlattice Layered Cathode for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropy&#8208;modulated layered oxide material (K0.7Mn0.4Li0.1Co0.125Ni0.125Fe0.125Cu0.125O2) is designed to leverage the inversed anion&#8211;cation redox process with a stable single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;state mechanism originating from macroscopic ion disorder and local lattice distortion features to achieve breakthroughs in potassium cathode functionality in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density.








Abstract
To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high&#8208;entropy superlattice layered oxide (K0.7Mn0.4Li0.1Co0.125Ni0.125Fe0.125Cu0.125O2, KMNCFCL0.1) is proposed as a cathode for K&#8208;ion storage. High&#8208;entropy composition and [Li&#9472;O&#9472;K] configuration coupled with Cu&#9472;O covalency and local CuO6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic&#8211;cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration.

     alt="Tailoring Lattice Oxygen Redox and Robust Structure Stability in High-Entropy Superlattice Layered Cathode for Superior Potassium-Ion Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entropy-modulated layered oxide material (K&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed to leverage the inversed anion&#8211;cation redox process with a stable single-phase solid-state mechanism originating from macroscopic ion disorder and local lattice distortion features to achieve breakthroughs in potassium cathode functionality in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high-entropy superlattice layered oxide (K&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, KMNCFCL&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;) is proposed as a cathode for K-ion storage. High-entropy composition and [Li&#9472;O&#9472;K] configuration coupled with Cu&#9472;O covalency and local CuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic&#8211;cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid-solution mechanism benefited from high-entropy stabilization, and &#8220;cocktail&#8221; effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) lattice distortion, O&#9472;O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt; delivers a high energy density of 327.8&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Discovery and Molecular Engineering Design for Enhancing Interface Stability of Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study leverages large language model and machine learning to identify and validate effective molecular candidates for stabilizing black phosphorus (BP) interfaces, achieving enhanced stability and introducing a synergistic molecular engineering strategy.








Abstract
Molecular engineering offers significant potential for developing advanced interfacial materials, yet the complexity of organic molecules poses challenges in discovering optimal structures. This study leveraged large language model (LLM) and machine learning (ML) to accelerate molecular discovery and guide molecular engineering for enhancing the stability of black phosphorus (BP), a promising 2D semiconductor but rapidly degrades when exposed to oxygen and moisture. By utilizing GPT&#8208;4o, molecular groups such as &#9472;SiR3, &#9472;PR2, &#9472;SH, and &#9552;NH that interact effectively with BP were identified and a high&#8208;throughput workflow employing graph neural networks (GNNs) models was developed to successfully predict and screen 662 promising candidates from over 117 million molecules. These candidates were validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments, with synthesis protocols guided by GPT&#8208;4o, achieving great interfacial stabilization of BP for up to 24 days under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a new synergistic molecular engineering strategy was proposed by incorporating functional head, linker, and tail groups of molecules to even enable the use of hydrophilic molecules to stabilize BP surface, overcoming traditional design limitations. This work highlights the AI technologies not only in optimizing BP interfacial stability but also in broader aspects of molecular engineering for various materials.

         <title>Molecular Insights into the Formation and Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots: From Precursor Intermediates to Surface Chemistry Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>Key molecular intermediates formed in the early stages of carbon nanodot (CND) formation from arginine and ethylenediamine were identified. The resulting CNDs were isolated and thoroughly characterized by several techniques. Multi&#8208;detection gel permeation chromatography enabled absolute determination of the molecular weight, dispersity, and hydrodynamic diameter, as well as estimation of the number of reactive surface amines per particle.








Abstract
Understanding the mechanistic pathways underlying carbon nanodot (CND) formation is essential for the rational design of synthesis strategies and the development of well&#8208;defined nanomaterials. In this work, we combine chromatographic isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and synthetic validation to identify key molecular intermediates in the early stages of CND formation from arginine (Arg) and ethylenediamine (EDA) under hydrothermal conditions. Using reverse&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, 1H/13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, we isolate and structurally confirm multiple reaction intermediates, including species arising from Arg cyclization and EDA&#8208;derived condensation products. Each proposed intermediate was validated via direct synthesis and comparative analysis. Fully formed CNDs were then isolated and extensively characterized through several techniques. Multi&#8208;detection gel permeation chromatography enabled the determination of absolute number average molecular weight (Mn&#160;=&#160;4,400&#160;&#177;&#160;458&#160;g mol&#8722;1), dispersity (&#272;&#160;=&#160;1.34), and hydrodynamic diameter (2.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm). Quantification of amine functionalities using Kaiser test and 19F NMR, upon condensation with a fluorinated aldehyde probe, established the presence of 6&#8211;7 amines per particle. Together, this systematic approach not only elucidates the mechanistic origin of CND formation but also establishes a robust framework for molecular&#8208;level CND design and functionalization.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Decrypted Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting in Chirality&#8208;Driven Supramolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive groups have been used to photo&#8208;decrypt the narcissistic self&#8208;sorting phenomenon. The inherent chirality of each component (homochiral or heterochiral) dictated the chirality&#8208;dependent assembly behaviors, leading to either social or narcissistic self&#8208;sorting. Photoirradiation triggered the formation of narcissistically self&#8208;sorted nanokebab nanostructures, which facilitated its direct visualization at the nanoscale. 








Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is crucial in biological systems, but achieving precise control over chiral narcissistic or social self&#8208;sorting as well as the distinction between them remains a major challenge in multicomponent supramolecular systems. To investigate chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, two classes of chiral building blocks, photo&#8208;responsive (cinnamic glutamide derivative, L/D&#8208;CG) and fluorescent molecules (dansyl glutamide derivative, L/D&#8208;DNSG), were designed and integrated into homochiral systems (L&#8208;CG/L&#8208;DNSG or D&#8208;CG/D&#8208;DNSG) and heterochiral systems (L&#8208;CG/D&#8208;DNSG or D&#8208;CG/L&#8208;DNSG). Either homo&#8208; or heterochiral systems could form organogels with fibrous structures. Upon photoirradiation, the homochiral systems remained stable, whereas the heterochiral systems underwent a significant transformation from uniform organogels to suspensions, in which nanokebab structures appeared. The results demonstrate that social self&#8208;sorting dominates in the homochiral systems while narcissistic self&#8208;sorting prevails in the heterochiral systems. Remarkably, the difference between homochiral and heterochiral systems is magnified through photodimerization. Various characterizations and simulations unveil the underlying homo&#8208; and heterochiral interactions that drive narcissistic self&#8208;sorting from the molecular to hierarchical nanoscale levels. This work decrypts the narcissistic or social self&#8208;sorting behavior in chirality&#8208;driven supramolecular systems through photoirradiation and provides a new perspective for understanding the regulation of chiral&#8208;driven functions in biological or material systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Aromatic Polyamide Membranes with Tunable Microporosity for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin aromatic polyamide membranes with tunable microporous structures were fabricated by modulation&#8208;assisted IP strategy for organic solvent nanofiltration. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of membranes are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate IP. Moreover, the optimized membranes demonstrate exceptional performance in separating high&#8208;value active pharmaceutical ingredients compared to commercial membranes.








Abstract
Advanced membrane technology for the separation and purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) requires improvement in both membrane materials and manufacturing processes to achieve&#160;the high rejection of macromolecular solutes combined with high permeance for organic solvents in pharmaceutical industry. Here, we report a novel approach to preparing aromatic polyamide membranes (PAMs) with tunable microporosity and micropore size via modulator&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of PAMs are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate interfacial polymerization, which can be demonstrated through experiments and molecular simulations. The resulting optimal membrane achieves a methanol permeance of 11.9&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, representing a impressive 19.8&#8208;fold increase compared to commercial benchmark membrane (0.6&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;bar&#8722;1) at the same molecular weight cut&#8208;off (&#8764;460&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1). For&#160;practical applications, the optimal membrane demonstrates exceptional capability in the separation of high&#8208;value APIs such as dipyridamole, achieving not only accelerated ethanol permeance but also a 6&#8208;fold enrichment factor relative to commercial membranes. This work demonstrates the significant potential of phenolphthalein&#8208;based microporous polyamide membrane in advancing API separation technologies. It provides valuable insights into the development of next&#8208;generation membrane systems tailored for pharmaceutical applications.

The resulting optimal membrane achieves a methanol permeance of 11.9&#160;L&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing a impressive 19.8-fold increase compared to commercial benchmark membrane (0.6&#160;L&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at the same molecular weight cut-off (&#8764;460&#160;g&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). For&#160;practical applications, the optimal membrane demonstrates exceptional capability in the separation of high-value APIs such as dipyridamole, achieving not only accelerated ethanol permeance but also a 6-fold enrichment factor relative to commercial membranes. This work demonstrates the significant potential of phenolphthalein-based microporous polyamide membrane in advancing API separation technologies. It provides valuable insights into the development of next-generation membrane systems tailored for pharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Iminium Singlet and Triplet Diradical(oid)s with Intense NIR&#8208;II Absorptions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized and isolated a series of stable iminium diradical(oid)s, their ground state was unequivocally confirmed by EPR and SQUID experiments, and their structure and electronic properties were revealed. CNR2+ features an open shell singlet ground state, and CNR3+ has an open shell triplet ground state. Both the open shell CNR2+ and CNR3+ display distinctively narrow band&#8208;gaps and exhibit long wavelength absorption bands that extend up to approximately 2400 nm.








Abstract
This study presents the successful synthesis of a series of stable iminium diradical(oid)s. CNR1+OTf&#8722;, CNR2+OTf&#8722;, and CNR3+OTf&#8722; can be readily prepared by treating their corresponding methoxy precursors with triflate acid. Remarkably, they all display excellent stability under light and ambient conditions. CNR1+ exhibits a closed shell electronic feature, whereas CNR2+ features an open shell singlet ground state. CNR3+OTf&#8722; possess triplet ground electronic state, as evidenced by ESR and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. Through meticulous fitting of the SQUID data, a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#8710;ES&#8208;T) of +1.04&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 along with intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions (&#952;) of &#8208;28&#160;K were obtained. In comparison to CNR1+, both the open shell CNR2+ and CNR3+ display distinctively red shifted long wavelength absorption bands that extend up to approximately 2400&#160;nm. Such long wavelength absorption characteristics are quite scarce among organic materials. This research offers a novel approach for the design and synthesis of iminium diradical(oid)s, which feature tunable ground states and exhibit intense absorption in the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region, opening up new possibilities in the field of organic materials research.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Anion Coordination Design for Tuning Li+ Transport Energy Barrier and Promoting the Performance of Li&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple&#8208;anion coordination design, featuring a broad and dense &#8220;energy band&#8221;, effectively tamed solvent reactivity and generated a robust rigid&#8208;soft coupled interfacial layer at the phosphorus (P) anode through the NO3&#8722;&#8208;FSI&#8722;&#8208;TFSI&#8722; adsorption&#8208;decomposition&#8208;sustained release cooperative mechanism.








Abstract
The complex phase transitions of lithiated phosphorus (P)&#160;species&#8208;derived interfacial side reactions can be substantially mitigated through a triple&#8208;anion coordination design within the solvation sheath. Our results indicate that the triple&#8208;anion electrolyte exhibits an expanded energy level distribution of solvation sheaths, a low barrier for migrating Li+ solvation sheath, a high Li+&#8208;anion coordination number, a low Li+&#8208;ether solvent coordination number and an effective NO3&#8722;&#8208;FSI&#8722;&#8208;TFSI&#8722; adsorption&#8208;decomposition&#8208;sustained release cooperative mechanism that generates a robust rigid&#8208;soft coupled SEI layer during the cycling process. When coupled with a LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell utilizing the triple&#8208;anion ether electrolyte demonstrates superior stability compared to cells using commercial LiPF6&#8208;EC/DEC electrolytes. More importantly, we establish a universal principle governing P/ether electrolyte compatibility, driven by anion&#8208;rich configurations: a higher Li+&#8208;FSI&#8722; coordination number and a lower Li+&#8208;solvent coordination number in the triple&#8208;anion electrolyte not only broaden the electrochemical window but also enable a remarkable 94% capacity retention at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles for P&#8208;based NCM523 full cells.

         <title>Skeletal Remodeling of Pyridines Through Nitrogen Atom Transposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel skeletal remodeling strategy allows for the transformation of pyridine into aniline, which serves as a multifunctional synthetic intermediate. By utilizing Lewis acid catalysis, the process enhances nucleophilic addition and nitrogen atom transposition, facilitating the rapid synthesis of diverse bioactive compounds. Mechanistic investigations through DFT calculations provide insights into the underlying processes, highlighting the potential of this strategy in pharmaceutical applications.








Abstract
Heterocyclic replacements are crucial tools in medicinal chemistry, enhancing the physicochemical properties of lead compounds. Pyridine, a core structural motif in numerous drug candidates, often serves as a key heterocyclic scaffold. Nonetheless, a universally applicable synthetic strategy for the direct conversion of pyridines into a diverse array of other heterocycles has yet to be established. In this study, we present a skeletal remodeling strategy that enables the transformation of pyridines into corresponding anilines via Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen atom transposition. These anilines can subsequently serve as versatile intermediates for accessing a variety of heterocyclic structures, thereby facilitating the rapid synthesis of novel bioactive analogs. DFT calculations indicate that the Lewis acid catalyst not only aids in the formation of pyridinium salts, enhances nucleophilic addition and nitrogen release. This methodology demonstrates considerable utility across a range of complex pyridine derivatives and several commercially available drugs, highlighting its potential for pharmaceutical diversification.

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclization&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the modular synthesis of unsaturated P5 reagents starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide via CuAAC. Diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides enable rapid, selective and stable antibody disulfide rebridging, exemplified by the generation of a potent and selective ADC. In addition, triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide enables a unique single reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol to access functional cyclic&#8208;peptide protein conjugates.








Abstract
Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo&#8208;[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.

         <title>Programmable DNA Nanocages Enable Adaptive Spatiotemporal Organization of Biomimetic Organelle Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanocages on extracellular vesicles form synthetic cytoskeletal scaffolds that stabilize compartmentalized units while enabling programmable reconfiguration of contact sites. This adaptive system achieves stimulus&#8208;responsive spatiotemporal control of inter&#8208;biomimetic&#8208;organelle communication.








Abstract
Synthetic organelles have emerged to simulate the multicompartmental organization and communication within cells. However, current synthetic organelles (e.g., lipid vesicles and polymer&#8208;based assemblies) often suffer from insufficient structural stability and lack adaptive feedback mechanisms due to the absence of support and dynamic regulation by natural cytoskeletal proteins, which limits the construction of autonomous communication networks. Here, we present a modular and programmable DNA nanocage strategy for constructing stable and adaptive synthetic organelle networks. Using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a model, we anchored tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDNs) on the EV surface and assembled a mechanically reinforced biomimetic DNA nanocage via palindromic hybridization chain reaction (PHCR), thereby significantly enhancing vesicle stability and effectively preventing membrane fusion upon contact. The modular design enables the integration of logic&#8208;gated DNA elements as dynamic contact sites, allowing environment&#8208;responsive reconfiguration of inter&#8208;artificial&#8208;organelle spatial organization and signaling. This work provides a customizable platform for constructing artificial organelles with adaptive feedback regulation, offering broad potential in synthetic biology, biomedical applications, and smart material design.

         <title>Noble Metal&#8208;Free Low&#8208;Temperature Aromatization of Polyethylene Waste for High&#8208;Quality Fuel Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of polyolefin cracking with the in situ generation of CH3OH via the Prins reaction enables the efficient, one&#8208;pot conversion of polyolefins into light aromatics under mild conditions, without the need for noble metals.









Abstract
The chemical recycling of waste plastics into high&#8208;quality fuels is highly attractive due to their similar chemical structures. Conventional methods like hydrocracking and hydrogenolysis, however, primarily yield alkanes with low octane numbers. This work presents a metal&#8208;free approach that converts polyethylene (PE) waste into fuels with tunable octane number (79&#8211;103) by leveraging a Prins reaction mediated low&#8208;temperature aromatization process, offering broad applicability for diverse combustion needs. By synchronizing CO hydrogenation rate with the aromatization of reactive dienes and oxygenates intermediates generated via the Prins reaction, up to 68% selectivity of light aromatics by weight was attained for octane number modification on a ZnZrO and ZSM&#8208;5 tandem catalytic system below 300&#160;&#176;C. A technical&#8208;economic analysis predicts a net post&#8208;tax profit of USD 65.3 million per year with a payback period of 3.8 years for a 200&#160;kton per year facility, providing a scalable and cost&#8208;effective pathway to upcycle polyolefins into fuels ranging from commercial gasoline (high octane) to aviation&#8208;grade compositions.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Long&#8208;Term Cycling Capability of Lithium Batteries Enabled by Releasing Local Constriction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the failure mechanism in sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries with Si anodes at high temperatures, where insufficient Li&#8208;ion diffusion leads to creep phase formation, triggering Li dendrite growth and aggravated interfacial side reactions. A GaP&#8208;doped and cPAN&#8208;coated Si anode is proposed, enabling stable battery operation at 120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Reusable interstellar exploration and commercial spaceflight urgently require the development of high&#8208;temperature secondary battery technology. However, metal/semimetal anodes contributing to high theoretical capacity are prone to creep at high temperatures, which raises&#160;significant concerns about battery safety and cycling performance. Here, we identify the generation of Li&#8208;rich phases at anodes that leads to the sustained degradation of high&#8208;temperature batteries. The non&#8208;conformal interface between anode and electrolyte constricts lithiation in local contact areas, resulting in extremely low chemical potential and subsequent evolution of high temperature unstable Li&#8208;rich phases. We therefore designed a heat&#8208;resistant anode featuring a Zintl&#8208;like phase core and an ion&#8208;electron co&#8208;conducting conformal coating, which releases local constriction while inhibiting high&#8208;temperature interfacial deactivation. Consequently, solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) assembled with this designed anode can stably cycle over 1,000 cycles at 120&#160;&#176;C (2C, pouch cell&#8208;340&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). Particularly distinguishing itself from molten salt high&#8208;temperature batteries, the SSB exhibits outstanding temperature adaptability in full&#8208;temperature dynamic tests (&#8722;40&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Au&#8208;Decorated Nb2O5 Featuring Unsaturated Niobium Centers and Photoinduced Oxygen Vacancies for Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane to C2+ Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold loaded Nb2O5 nanorods featuring unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OV) sites significantly boost the photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane into C2+ hydrocarbons, in which unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced OV sites cooperatively mediated CH4 activation, C&#9472;C bond formation and lattice oxygen looping to deliver exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) holds considerable potential for producing value&#8208;added chemicals. However, this technology currently faces two major challenges: low methane conversion and significant overoxidation. Herein, we report a gold (Au) decorated niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) featuring unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced oxygen vacancies (OV), which achieved a CH4 conversion rate of 3.21&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of &#8764;98.1% toward C2+ hydrocarbons (&#955;&#160;=&#160;320&#8722;780&#160;nm, 300&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), outperforming the selectivity of previously reported photocatalysts. Operando characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that the unsaturated Nb centers play a crucial role in promoting methane activation and facilitating the transfer of methyl (*CH3) intermediates to the Au cocatalyst, thereby boosting the C&#9472;C coupling pathway while suppressing undesired overoxidation. Concurrently, the photoinduced OV sites enable the timely release of H2O from the lattice oxygen, thus enhancing O2 activation and improving the lattice oxygen looping efficiency. This work provides new insights into the atomically precise design of photocatalysts that deliver both good activity and high selectivity in methane valorization.

Operando characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that the unsaturated Nb centers play a crucial role in promoting methane activation and facilitating the transfer of methyl (*CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) intermediates to the Au cocatalyst, thereby boosting the C&#9472;C coupling pathway while suppressing undesired overoxidation. Concurrently, the photoinduced O&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; sites enable the timely release of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from the lattice oxygen, thus enhancing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and improving the lattice oxygen looping efficiency. This work provides new insights into the atomically precise design of photocatalysts that deliver both good activity and high selectivity in methane valorization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Peptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis Unlocks Asymmetric Desymmetrization of Phosphoryl Acids: Programmable Synthesis of P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired peptide&#8208;phosphonium salt (PPS) catalytic system enables efficient desymmetrization of prochiral phosphinic acids under ambient, metal&#8208;free conditions, establishing a versatile platform for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic architectures. It features a modular two&#8208;stage protocol transforms the stereodefined P(V) building blocks into structurally diverse phosphinate esters and tertiary phosphine oxides with &gt;99% ee stereofidelity. Moreover, comprehensive mechanistic investigations reveal the chiral microenvironment within the PPS catalyst orchestrates stereochemical control via synergistic hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic steering effects.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral phosphorus(V) compounds represents a pivotal strategy for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic skeletons, yet existing methods face limitations in structural diversification and metal&#8208;free catalytic systems. Here we disclose that a bioinspired peptide&#8208;phosphonium salt (PPS) catalytic system successfully enables precise desymmetrization of phosphinic acids through synergistic ion&#8208;pairing and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. This strategy affords multifunctional platform molecules bearing P(V)&#8208;stereocenters with excellent enantiocontrol and broad compatibility (43 examples, up to 92% yield, up to &gt;99% ee) at very low catalyst loading (1 mol%). Furthermore, the P(V)&#8208;chiral building blocks undergo stereospecific derivatization to access structurally diverse phosphinates (27 examples, up to 75% yield, up to &gt;99% ee) and tertiary phosphine oxides (10 examples). Mechanistic studies reveal that the stereochemical origin is from a semi&#8208;enclosed chiral cavity, where dynamic electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions synergistically orchestrate the stereodetermining transition state. The two&#8208;stage desymmetrization&#8211;derivatization process establishes a versatile platform for modular synthesis of valuable P(V)&#8208;stereogenic pharmaceuticals and functional molecules.

         <title>In Situ Interface Reaction Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ interface reaction strategy has been developed to prepare perovskite films with strong quantum confinement, yielding stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 468&#160;nm. Consequently, the resulting deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes achieve an impressive peak external quantum efficiency of 16.3%. Additionally, this strategy enables large&#8208;scale bright deep&#8208;blue devices and high&#8208;quality active&#8208;matrix displays.








Abstract
The development of blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is critical for advancing next&#8208;generation display technologies. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide blue perovskites remains challenging due to their intrinsic vulnerability to high defect densities, ion migration, and inefficient charge transport. To address this, we introduce a rapid in situ interface reaction at the buried interface between the perovskite layer and the underlying poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) film. This engineered interface reaction represents a novel method for preparing high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue CsPb(Br/Cl)3 films. By incorporating lithium salicylate (SAL) as a reaction initiator into the perovskite precursor, a proton exchange is triggered between PEDOT:PSS and SAL, resulting in the formation of a multifunctional PSS&#8208;Li interfacial layer. This layer modulates perovskite nucleation and growth, producing compact, uniform, and small&#8208;grained deep&#8208;blue perovskite films with reduced trap densities and enhanced quantum confinement. Combined with optimized charge dynamics, the resulting spectrally stable deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 16.3% at 468&#160;nm. This approach facilitates the successful integration of uniform and high&#8208;clarity active&#8208;matrix displays on thin&#8208;film transistor circuit substrates.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired 2D Asymmetric Nanochannels for High&#8208;Resolution Li+/Mg2+ Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric structure of Janus graphene oxide membranes (JGOM) with diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior was constructed. Based on the synergy of the two nanochannels, the JGOM demonstrated robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, outperforming symmetrical structure GO membranes and other reported 2D membranes.








Abstract
Extracting lithium from salt lake brines is crucial to achieve sustainable development of lithium resources. However, it remains a major challenge to design nanochannels with efficient selectivity and fast transport for target ions. Here, inspired by biological membranes, we reported a Janus graphene oxide membrane (JGOM) with an asymmetric structure that exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport behavior and achieves high&#8208;efficiency Li+/Mg2&#8314; separation for lithium extraction applications. During the forward transport of ions, the nGO nanochannels modified by sulfonate groups (SO3&#8722;) with precise size provide hopping recognition sites and additional electrostatic attraction for the fast transport of Li+, while imposed Mg2+ dehydration and exposure to a stronger positive charge. The continuous pGO nanochannels modified by amino groups (NH3+) further prevent the passage of dehydrated Mg2+ by enhanced electrostatic repulsion while allowing Li+ to transfer. Under the synergy of the two nanochannels, the JGOM demonstrates robust Li+/Mg2+ separation performance, outperforming symmetrical structure GO membranes and other reported membranes, which was further confirmed by simulation results. This study provides a new insight into the rational design of ion sieving membranes.

         <title>Deep Eutectic Solvent Binder Facilitating Reaction Kinetics of Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep eutectic solvent (DES) binder comparing citric acid and betaine (CB) is developed for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries using the microwave irradiation method. A highly reversible hydrogen bond network is conducive to providing exceptional binding capability, excellent self&#8208;healing ability, and flame&#8208;retardant performance, while Li+ flux is directly regulated by the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) of DES. 








Abstract
Existing binders fail to integrate all designed functionalities, including the polysulfide shuttle effect, sluggish kinetic transformation, electrode volume variation, slow Li&#8314; transfer, and flammable characteristics. Herein, the microwave irradiation method is used to prepare deep eutectic solvent (DES) binder; with the rapid conduction and full utilization of energy, citric acid and betaine (CB) binder is formed in a flash. Intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between C and B provide robust adhesion, self&#8208;healing capability, and flame&#8208;retardant properties. More importantly, Li&#8314; flux is directly improved by hydrogen bond acceptor (B) of DES rather than introducing additional segments or chemical treatment; then the redox kinetics are significantly promoted and the polysulfide shuttle is further suppressed. The types and dynamics of the hydrogen bonds are observed via Raman and dynamic mechanical analysis, while effective LiPS adsorption capability is confirmed through theoretical calculations and in situ Raman measurements. Furthermore, rapid LiPS conversion is verified by nucleation/dissolution experiments of Li2S and distribution of relaxation times (DRTs) analysis, and nucleation transformation ratio (NTR) calculation shows the similar result. Benefiting from the superior merits of the DES binder, lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) battery presents stable cycling at 5&#160;C with 61.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles.

         <title>Efficient Electronic&#8208;Structure Methods Toward Catalyst Screening: Projection&#8208;Based Embedding Theory for CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows how projection&#8208;based embedding theory can be successfully applied to study chemical reactions on metal surfaces by providing guidelines for adequate system partitioning and an appropriate description of the intersystem interactions. This efficient and systematically improvable approach contributes significantly to the computational chemistry toolbox for heterogeneous catalysis as it paves the way toward routine application.








Abstract
Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro&#8208;)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange&#8208;correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open&#8208; and closed&#8208;shell CO2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full photoisomerization mechanism of the all&#8208;red&#8208;light addressable peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) has been decoded. Theory and transient absorption spectroscopy show that both E&#8594;Z$E\rightarrow Z$ and Z&#8594;E$Z\rightarrow E$ switching proceed via the triplet state. Competing pathways differ: whereas E$E$&#8208;PAT shows a flat T1$T_1$ minimum, Z$Z$&#8208;PAT undergoes fast singlet deactivation. These insights explain PAT's efficient bidirectional switching and guide rational design.








Abstract
In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;$\pi$&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared addressability. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and second&#8208;order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the T1$\mathsf {T_1}$ PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;$\pi$&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational&#160;way.

         <title>The ConPET Mechanism Remains Veiled: Reply to &#8220;Unlocking the ConPeT Mechanism&#8221;</title>

This Reply addresses Ceroni's Correspondence, which proposed a revised electron transfer (ET) mechanism for the cyanoarene&#8208;photocatalyzed consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) process via time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. While their model highlights solvated electrons from the excited radical anion 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenyl amino)phthalonitrile (4DPAPN&#8226;&#8722;), new experimental and theoretical analyses underscore the plausibility of the original proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET)/ConPET pathway. Rigorous reinvestigation under controlled conditions reaffirms the complexity of the mechanism and calls for further spectroscopic and computational studies to resolve these interplaying pathways. The discussion advances the debate on photoredox mechanisms, offering actionable strategies for future mechanistic elucidation.








Abstract
In this journal, a Correspondence by Ventura, Cozzi, and Ceroni reported time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy studies in the electron transfer process from cyanoarene photocatalyst 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenyl amino)phthalonitrile (4DPAPN) in the presence of tetrabutylammonium oxalate (TBAOx). This was used as a model reaction to investigate the mechanism of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) in our previously reported asymmetric [3+2] photocycloaddition. They proposed a new electron transfer pathway in which the electron from the excited state of the radical anion 4DPAPN*&#8226;&#8722; solvated in acetonitrile. This article replies to their Correspondence, including: the experimental and theoretical analysis on the driving force of electron transfer and a series of new experiments conducted with purer reagents under more stringent conditions, which suggest that the process of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) followed by ConPET cannot be excluded, as proposed in our previous publication. Yet, Ceroni et&#160;al.&#8217;s efforts to study organic photochemical reactions using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy remain worthwhile, and their proposed mechanism also led us to consider other possible pathways for the reaction. This article concludes with a series of constructive suggestions for further studying the ConPET mechanism using time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy and other techniques.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical confinement strategy combined spatial confinement at nanoscale and strong anchoring effect at atomic scale, enabling the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nano sized cluster as ideal electrocatalyst materials. These sub&#8208;Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER).








Abstract
The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (&#8764;1&#160;nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub&#8208;nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.

         <title>Molecular Design of Asymmetric Difluorinated Ether Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated alkyl groups were found to greatly influence the Li+ transport behavior and final interface chemistry of derived ether electrolytes. The Li&#9472;F coordination of the &#9472;CF2H group is proven to tailor electrolyte solvation and enable optimal electrochemical performance, while the &#9472;CF2CF2H group shows no Li&#9472;F coordination and leads to the sluggish transport of Li+ cations.








Abstract
Fluorination of electrolyte solvents is key to improving the cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet the critical role of fluorinated alkyl chain length in governing solvation and interphase chemistries remains unclear. Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the &#9472;CF2H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li&#9472;F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated &#9472;CF2CF2H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li+ ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual&#8208;layer interface featuring a LiF&#8208;rich inner phase and a Li2CO3&#8208;dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO2 cells (2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140&#8208;mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles. Our study offers fundamental insights into the design of advanced fluorinated electrolytes for the stable operation of high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

The Li&#9472;F coordination of the &#9472;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H group is proven to tailor electrolyte solvation and enable optimal electrochemical performance, while the &#9472;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H group shows no Li&#9472;F coordination and leads to the sluggish transport of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorination of electrolyte solvents is key to improving the cycling stability of high-voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet the critical role of fluorinated alkyl chain length in governing solvation and interphase chemistries remains unclear. Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the &#9472;CF&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li&#9472;F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated &#9472;CF&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CF&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual-layer interface featuring a LiF-rich inner phase and a Li&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cells (2.5 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140-mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles. Our study offers fundamental insights into the design of advanced fluorinated electrolytes for the stable operation of high-voltage LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide diradicaloid compound [(ADC)2Ge4] featuring a stretched bridgehead Ge&#9472;Ge bond is reported as a Venetian red crystalline solid. [(ADC)2Ge4] has been characterized by experimental and computational methods and its reactivity with TEMPO and Fe2(CO)9 has been explored.








Abstract
The synthesis, structure, and reactivity of the bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Ge2]2 (3), which features a Ge4 core bridged by two anionic dicarbene frameworks (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), are reported. Treatment of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized amidine Me3SiC&#8801;CN(Dipp)C(Ph)&#9552;N(Dipp) (1) with GeCl4 affords [(ADC)GeCl3(GeCl4)] (2). KC8 reduction of 2 yields 3 as a Venetian red crystalline solid. DFT calculations reveal a singlet ground state for 3 with the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 14&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. CASSCF (complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) calculations suggest a modest diradical character (&#946;&#160;=&#160;9%) for 3. Compound 3 readily reacts with TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) to yield the Ge&#9472;Ge bond&#8208;cleaved product, [(ADC)Ge(Ge&#8208;TEMPO)]2 (4). Treatment of 3 with Fe2(CO)9 gives [(ADC)Ge(Ge{Fe(CO)4})]2 (5).

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational design strategy for molecular glue degraders. By appending specific chemical gluing moieties to small molecule inhibitors, we successfully converted them into degraders without the need for a dedicated E3 ligase&#8208;binding motif. We found that introducing an aromatic ring or a double bond into a CDK12/13 inhibitor enabled the recruitment of the ubiquitination factor DDB1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that installing a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead onto a BRD4 inhibitor promotes DCAF16&#8208;dependent BRD4 degradation.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4&#8208;associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.

         <title>Aqueous Separation of Styrene from Ethylbenzene Using a Water&#8208;Soluble Cyclophane</title>

Abstract
The selective separation of hydrocarbons such as styrene (ST) and ethylbenzene (EB) remains a formidable challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their nearly identical molecular structures and physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a robust, water&#8208;soluble, metal&#8208;free tetracationic cyclophane (B) capable of achieving&#160;&gt;99% selective extraction of ST from EB in aqueous media with excellent recyclability. B features a hydrophobic, conformationally adaptive cavity (&#8764;6.5&#160;&#197;&#160;&#215;&#160;14.3&#160;&#197;) that selectively recognizes planar over nonplanar guests in aqueous medium. Solution&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state analyses confirm that the preferential binding of ST is driven by favorable interactions with its vinyl group and induced planarization of the host. B also distinguishes phenanthrene (P) from 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (DHA), further validating its precision in shape&#8208;selective molecular recognition. Our findings demonstrate a unique aqueous separation of ST from EB employing a metal&#8208;free receptor that advances the design of selective host&#8211;guest systems and supports greener alternatives for hydrocarbon purification.

         <title>Transforming Chemiluminescence from Flash to Glow by Breaking the Catalytic Limitation with a Medium&#8208;Entropy Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic limitation of nanozymes severely restricts their high&#8208;active catalysis for achieving persistent chemiluminescence. A medium&#8208; entropy Prussian blue analogue is constructed to efficiently break the catalytic limitation and achieve the application of persistent chemiluminescence imaging. The mechanism is ascribed to the intrareticular electron transfer among the metal sites to accelerate the cycle of active valence.








Abstract
Intensive and persistent chemiluminescence (CL) emission is highly desired in biological imaging and is also a conundrum for most CL systems. Catalysts can efficiently improve the flash intensity but scarcely achieve persistent enhancement due to their catalytic limitation on CL reaction. Herein, a medium&#8208;entropy (ME) nanozyme with trinuclear configuration and a classical Prussian blue analogue (PBA) structure was designed to break the catalytic limitation. The ME PBA showed favorable enhancement on both flash and persistent CL emission of luminol&#8208;H2O2 system due to the recycling generation of catalytic center Co(II) through quick electron transfer among metal sites within framework, which provided a relatively stable CL emission enhanced by over two orders of magnitude in 1&#160;h, achieving the transformation of CL from flash to glow. The CL enhancement and active valence cycle mechanism via intrareticular electron transfer were revealed by both experiments and density functional theory calculations. A facile CL imaging method was proposed to evaluate the bacterial motility, which demonstrated the application potential of the ME PBA. This work offers a new avenue to transform CL from flash to glow by breaking the catalytic limitation of nanozymes, which will conveniently expand their application in bioanalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Catalytic limitation of nanozymes severely restricts their high-active catalysis for achieving persistent chemiluminescence. A medium- entropy Prussian blue analogue is constructed to efficiently break the catalytic limitation and achieve the application of persistent chemiluminescence imaging. The mechanism is ascribed to the intrareticular electron transfer among the metal sites to accelerate the cycle of active valence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensive and persistent chemiluminescence (CL) emission is highly desired in biological imaging and is also a conundrum for most CL systems. Catalysts can efficiently improve the flash intensity but scarcely achieve persistent enhancement due to their catalytic limitation on CL reaction. Herein, a medium-entropy (ME) nanozyme with trinuclear configuration and a classical Prussian blue analogue (PBA) structure was designed to break the catalytic limitation. The ME PBA showed favorable enhancement on both flash and persistent CL emission of luminol-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system due to the recycling generation of catalytic center Co(II) through quick electron transfer among metal sites within framework, which provided a relatively stable CL emission enhanced by over two orders of magnitude in 1&#160;h, achieving the transformation of CL from flash to glow. The CL enhancement and active valence cycle mechanism via intrareticular electron transfer were revealed by both experiments and density functional theory calculations. A facile CL imaging method was proposed to evaluate the bacterial motility, which demonstrated the application potential of the ME PBA. This work offers a new avenue to transform CL from flash to glow by breaking the catalytic limitation of nanozymes, which will conveniently expand their application in bioanalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2 Photoreduction by H2O: Cooperative Catalysis of Palladium Species on Poly(triazine imide) Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particulate and isolated palladium species (Pd0 and Pd2+) supported on poly(triazine imide) prisms synergistically drive photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O. Pd0 and Pd2+ sites selectively capture photoexcited electrons and holes to drive CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation, respectively. Upon hole capture, Pd2+ is oxidized to Pd4+ that mediates H2O oxidation to O2, while bestowing H* to assist CO2 reduction on neighboring Pd0 particles.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with H2O oxidation has been pursued extensively, albeit facing challenges in efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we develop a PdSAs+NPs/PTI catalyst by co&#8208;anchoring atomic and nanoparticulate Pd species on poly(triazine imide) crystals, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability for CO2 reduction to CO using H2O as the reductant. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the dual Pd species synergistically enhance charge separation and transfer while promoting CO2 activation, CO desorption, and H2O dissociation. Photo&#8208;stimulated electrons migrate to Pd nanoparticles to reduce CO2, and holes oxidize Pd2+ sites to Pd4+ species that catalyze H2O splitting to OH* and H*. The resulting H* spills onto adjacent Pd nanoparticles to support proton&#8208;coupled CO2 reduction, whereas OH* is oxidized by Pd4+ to evolve O2, regenerating Pd2+, and closing the catalysis cycle. Importantly, the photoinduced Pd4+ sites dynamically modulate the local adsorption environment, weakening *CO binding on nearby Pd nanoparticles. This facilitates *CO desorption and hampers its hydrogenation to CH4, enabling high CO selectivity. The optimal catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 22.2&#160;mmol&#160;gPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 95.7% selectivity, stably operating over 30 h.

         <title>Promoting Ampere&#8208;Level Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Through Strong Oxide&#8211;Oxide Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly efficient oxide&#8211;oxide catalytic system fabricated by coupling Co3O4 nanoparticles with CuO nanosheets for the electrochemical reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. The NH3 Faradaic efficiencies of CuO and Co3O4 are significantly optimized through the strong oxide&#8211;oxide interface between the two components. Consequently, nitrate can be effectively converted into NH3 at an ampere&#8208;level current density.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate to value&#8208;added ammonia offers a promising approach for removing nitrate pollutants from wastewater, combining energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, developing industrially viable catalysts that combine high efficiency, low&#8208;cost, and high durability remains a significant challenge. Herein, cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles are anchored onto the copper oxide (CuO) nanosheets support (Co3O4@CuO) to boost the electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia via a strong oxide&#8211;oxide interaction. The optimized Co3O4@CuO catalyst exhibits a superb nitrate reduction performance, including a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% at an ampere&#8208;level current density of approximately 2500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the strong oxide&#8211;oxide interaction between Co3O4 and CuO regulates the adsorption configuration of nitrite and the subsequent hydrogenation process. This interaction can effectively control the overall reaction pathway, thereby enhancing the yield and selectivity of ammonia. The strategic combination of these oxide materials provides a guiding framework for developing high&#8208;performance catalytic systems.

         <title>Stable Luminescent Radicals with Efficient Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two luminescent radicals have been synthesized that feature through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states. The spatial separation and non&#8208;bonding character between the donor and radical units suppress electron&#8208;vibrational coupling, resulting in CZP&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM showing a photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 64.3% and an ultralow non&#8208;radiative decay rate of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8310; s&#8722;1. Weak orbital coupling leads to non&#8208;Aufbau electronic structures, thereby enhancing the radical stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance luminescent radicals featuring donor&#8208;radical (D&#8208;R) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on through&#8208;bond charge&#8208;transfer (TBCT) mechanisms. In this work, we report the first examples of luminescent radicals based on TTM (tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical) with through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states, represented by TPA&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM and CZP&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM. Spatial separation and non&#8208;bonding character between the donor and radical units minimizes electron&#8208;vibrational coupling and effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay. As a result, CZP&#8208;FR&#8208;TTM exhibits an outstanding photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 64.3% and an ultralow non&#8208;radiative decay rate of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1, among the lowest ever reported for luminescent radicals. Furthermore, the reduced electronic coupling leads to non&#8208;Aufbau electronic structures, enhancing radical stability. These findings establish TSCT as a powerful design strategy for high&#8208;performance and stable luminescent radicals, opening new avenues for open&#8208;shell optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Unbiased Stable Photoelectrochemical Glycerol Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased integrated system for photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction was designed by coupling the NiFeB/Ge/Zr&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)&#8208;NC cathode, showing a current density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#160;h operation with a formate selectivity of &#8764;80%.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (PEC GOR) is considered as one of the promising strategies for obtaining high&#8208;value products and transforming solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co&#8208;doped Fe2O3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co&#8208;doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co&#8208;catalyst promotes the cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)&#8208;NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with continuously operation of 100&#160;h. The bias&#8208;free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2, representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high&#8208;value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization. This work provides new avenues for the sustainable solar&#8208;powered chemical synthesis of unbiased PEC systems with high selectivity and durability.

The Ge and Zr co-doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co-catalyst promotes the cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode with Fe(Pt)-NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with continuously operation of 100&#160;h. The bias-free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high-value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization. This work provides new avenues for the sustainable solar-powered chemical synthesis of unbiased PEC systems with high selectivity and durability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Cleavage of C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C Bonds in Lignin Linkages by Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models was achieved by taking advantage of the unique and strong alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals.








Abstract
Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half&#8208;lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. The &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C&#946;&#9472;O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air&#8211;water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bonds in &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 and &#946;&#8208;1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C&#9472;O/C&#9472;C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.

         <title>Converting and Fabricating LiCoO2 Cathode Material into a Disordered Rocksalt Surface Modification Layer to Enhance Interfacial Stability of High&#8208;Voltage Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work converts layered LiCoO2 (LCO) into a disordered rocksalt coating material (DS) with anionic oxidation activity, inducing electrolyte nucleophilic decomposition to co&#8208;construct a stable LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). The synergy of enhanced CEI and DS coating, which has high Li+ conductivity and lattice coherence with LCO, notably improves interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of high&#8208;voltage LCO cathode.








Abstract
Surface coating acts as an effective strategy to enhance the interfacial stability of high&#8208;voltage cathode, but yet there remains substantial potential value in exploring optimal materials and methods. Herein, we convert spent LiCoO2 (LCO) into nanosized disordered rocksalt&#8208;phase (DS) coating material, which exhibits considerable Li+ conductivity and high lattice&#8208;coherent compatibility with LCO. Subsequently, using a facile and scalable high&#8208;speed mechanofusion technology, we construct a continuous, uniform, and tightly bound DS coating layer onto LCO, denoted as DS@LCO cathode. Benefiting from the nucleophilic reaction between fluorinated electrolyte and reactive oxygen released from DS coating layer, a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) film is achieved, with an outer LiF&#8208;rich protective shield and inner flexible fluorinated polymer. Coupled with the lattice&#8208;coherent DS coating layer and reinforced CEI film, the hybrid surface architecture synergistically enhances the interfacial stability, thermal safety, and electrochemical performance of DS@LCO cathode. As a result, a stable operation of DS@LCO half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.1% capacity retention after 250 cycles). Long&#8208;life and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density (1032&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) pouch cells are harvested, retaining over 86% capacity after 1000 cycles. This coating/CEI&#8208;coupled interface design provides a sustainable and scalable surface modification route for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathodes with enhanced interfacial stability.

         <title>Unraveling the Potential&#8208;Regulated Selectivity of the Cu&#8208;Based Catalyst in 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential&#8208;regulated selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst in 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electro&#8208;oxidation is revealed. At high potentials, CuO&#8208;derived CuOOH indirectly oxidizes HMF, preferentially targeting the aldehyde (&#8208;CHO) group. Further potential increase activates the CuOOH&#8208;mediated direct oxidation process, shifting selectivity toward the less reactive hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) group since enhanced surface coverage mainly hinders &#8208;CHO adsorption.








Abstract
2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), prepared via the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (HMFOR), is a promising bio&#8208;based plastic monomer for biodegradable polymer production. However, the sluggish hydroxyl oxidation kinetics inhibit the HMFOR efficiency. In this study, CuOxHy is grown on Cu foam as a model electrocatalyst to investigate the active phases of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst in the HMFOR, elucidate their oxidation mechanisms and adsorption behaviors at varying potentials, and ultimately to reveal the potential&#8208;regulated selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that CuIII&#9472;OOH, generated from CuO at high potentials, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, enabling HMFOR to proceed via an indirect oxidation process that favors aldehyde oxidation. A further increase in potential activates the direct oxidation process of CuIII&#9472;OOH, selectively oxidizing hydroxyl groups owing to the increased substrate coverage on the catalyst, which hinders aldehyde adsorption. This study offers a new strategy for enhancing the selectivity towards the oxidation of specific functional groups in value&#8208;added biomass conversion processes.

At high potentials, CuO-derived CuOOH indirectly oxidizes HMF, preferentially targeting the aldehyde (-CHO) group. Further potential increase activates the CuOOH-mediated direct oxidation process, shifting selectivity toward the less reactive hydroxyl (-OH) group since enhanced surface coverage mainly hinders -CHO adsorption.

         <title>Engineering Mechanostable Anticalin Scaffolds to Enhance Particle Adhesion and Targeting of CTLA&#8208;4 Under Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchor&#8208;point engineering modulates the mechanostability of targeting proteins. Clickable residues were placed at 17 sites on a CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;binding Anticalin and probed by AFM and particle&#8208;based adhesion assays. Pulling from K62 located farthest from CTLA&#8208;4&#8242;s center of mass, generated the strongest molecular complexes and the highest particle adhesion. This work introduces a simple design rule for functionalizing particles to adhere to specific cell types and resist mechanical shear.








Abstract
Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non&#8208;antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA&#8208;4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio&#8208;orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single&#8208;molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead&#8208;based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA&#8208;4) complex. Multi&#8208;regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA&#8208;4&#8242;s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA&#8208;4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.

         <title>Activation of a Secondary&#8208;Messenger Receptor via Allosteric Modulation of a Dynamic Conformational Ensemble</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically disordered loops within globular protein domains have long escaped structural biology. Here, S&#246;ldner et&#160;al. show that despite this disorder, an allosteric modulation is exerted in a secondary&#8208;messenger receptor by binding of its secondary messenger. This effectively reorients the conformational ensemble of its binding interfaces without abrogating their high degree of dynamics.








Abstract
Bacterial signaling cascades have recently become of great relevance in the context of bacterial antibiotics resistance. Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP) is a key bacterial secondary messenger involved in growth, biofilm formation, virulence gene expression and others. The activation mechanisms of c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP receptors like the trimeric PII&#8208;like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger&#8208;bound forms of the 44&#160;kDa homotrimeric PII&#8208;like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural&#8208;biology understanding.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Azides and Selenoalkynes with Built&#8208;in &#8220;Catch&#8208;and&#8208;Release&#8221; Functionality</title>

A highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of azides and selenoalkynes has been developed. This process is robust in air and water as well as biological media, including PBS and cell lysate. Owing to the unique advantage of facile oxidative cleavage of the C&#9472;Se bond, this reaction features a built&#8208;in &#8220;catch&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; functionality that has potential applications in biological systems.








Abstract
Click reactions with a &#8220;catch&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; functionality featuring both cross&#8208;linking and bond cleavage may have unique biomedical applications. However, despite the high demand, such reactions are rarely known in the toolbox of biochemists. Herein we introduce a robust click reaction of selenoalkynes that not only facilitates mild cross&#8208;linking with azides but also permits exceptionally facile cleavage of the C&#9472;Se bond in the adducts. This highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed protocol features high chemoselectivity and regioselectivity, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and good tolerance of functional groups and solvents. The compatibility with air and water as well as biomolecules has been demonstrated in parallel with the &#8220;catch&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; functionality.

         <title>Facet Engineering and Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co Bridged Heterojunction Enable Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 as High&#8208;Performance Photocatalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 core&#8208;shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The design incorporates carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 within ZIF67&#8208;D, exposing (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption.








Abstract
Ammonia synthesis is vital for global fertilizer production but traditionally relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, a major contributor to CO2 emissions. Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a sustainable alternative by harnessing solar energy under ambient conditions. However, challenges such as low nitrogen adsorption, poor conductivity, and high electron&#8208;hole recombination of the photocatalysts limit their efficiency. This study introduces an Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 core&#8208;shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co bridged Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This design incorporates carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 in ZIF67&#8208;D (ZIF67&#8208;dodecahedron) with exposed (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption. Fe&#9472;N4 and Co&#9472;N4 active sites improve catalytic activity, while the carbon layer enhances conductivity and facilitates oxygen vacancy formation. The Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co bridged heterojunction further promotes charge separation and transfer. Therefore, the Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 composite achieves an outstanding ammonia yield of 33.2 mmol&#160;L&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (outperforming other systems) with high selectivity and minimal by&#8208;products. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts by integrating the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks, core&#8208;shell architectures, and interfacial engineering, marking a significant step forward in sustainable ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Manipulating Competitive Li+ Coordination of F&#8208;Rich Polymer and High Flash Point Glyme Electrolyte Enabling High Rate and Intrinsically Safe Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deconstruction strategy of a solvation cage for PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes, we adopted the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms within the in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) matrix and Li+ in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries to disrupt the tight tetraglyme (G4)&#8208;Li+ chelating effect. Subsequently, the Li+&#8208;transport behavior and cycle performance at a high rate have been effectively improved. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based batteries incorporating quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes (QSEs) represent a promising approach to attain both high safety and high energy density. Nevertheless, the issues of limited ionic conductivity and insufficient solid&#8211;solid contact interfaces significantly impede their practical applications. In this study, an intrinsically safe QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) in high flash point tetraglyme (G4)&#8208;based electrolyte is developed. Owing to the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms within the polymer matrix and Li+, solvation cage caused by the &#8220;chelating&#8221; effect between Li+ and solvent molecules is disrupted. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that a solvated structure predominantly characterized by the contact ion pair is formed. Therefore, a robust solid electrolyte interface enriched with anion&#8208;derived LiF&#8208; and B&#8208;species is constructed. As a result, matched with a commercial&#8208;level loading LiFePO4 cathode, a capacity retention of 92.7% is obtained even after 200 cycles. These results elucidate the polymer matrix's pivotal role in QSEs, offering novel pathway for designing advanced quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, such as Li/Na/K/Mg/Ca et&#160;al.

         <title>Architecture Engineering and Phase Engineering of Rhodium Metallene Co&#8208;Boost Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium metallene nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) integrating architecture engineering and phase engineering are well&#8208;designed to boost nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroconversion. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique structure of Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, which exposes more active sites due to its ultrathin nature and abundant pores. Meanwhile, amorphous regions enhance nitrite adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier, guiding catalyst design.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) offers an effective strategy for sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis and N&#8208;pollutants wastewater degradation. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;engineering strategy by combining architecture engineering and phase engineering on nanosheet&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NS) coupled with twisted nanoribbon&#8208;like rhodium metallene (Rh&#8208;NR) nanoarchitectonics (Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR) to boost NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electroconversion. Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO2&#8722; and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 44.3&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for NO2RR at high reduction potential (0.00&#160;V). Using Rh&#8208;NS/Rh&#8208;NR as cathode, the assembled zinc&#8211;nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and promising NH3 synthesis capacity (5.96&#160;mg mgcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). This work not only guides the architecture&#8208;engineering design of metallene but also demonstrates the practical potential of zinc&#8211;nitrite batteries in integrated energy&#8208;environmental applications.

     alt="Architecture Engineering and Phase Engineering of Rhodium Metallene Co-Boost Nitrite-to-Ammonia Electroconversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodium metallene nanoarchitectonics (Rh-NS/Rh-NR) integrating architecture engineering and phase engineering are well-designed to boost nitrite-to-ammonia electroconversion. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique structure of Rh-NS/Rh-NR, which exposes more active sites due to its ultrathin nature and abundant pores. Meanwhile, amorphous regions enhance nitrite adsorption and lower the reaction energy barrier, guiding catalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) offers an effective strategy for sustainable ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis and N-pollutants wastewater degradation. Herein, we propose a dual-engineering strategy by combining architecture engineering and phase engineering on nanosheet-like rhodium metallene (Rh-NS) coupled with twisted nanoribbon-like rhodium metallene (Rh-NR) nanoarchitectonics (Rh-NS/Rh-NR) to boost NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electroconversion. Rh-NS/Rh-NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh-NS/Rh-NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 44.3&#160;mg mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR at high reduction potential (0.00&#160;V). Using Rh-NS/Rh-NR as cathode, the assembled zinc&#8211;nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and promising NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis capacity (5.96&#160;mg mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work not only guides the architecture-engineering design of metallene but also demonstrates the practical potential of zinc&#8211;nitrite batteries in integrated energy-environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(p&#8208;phenylene phosphaborene): A Modified Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with &#960;&#8208;Conjugated B&#9552;P Linkages</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene phosphaborene) (BP&#8208;PPV), derived from poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by substitution of the bridging C&#9552;C moieties by valence isoelectronic B&#9552;P units, has been prepared. The polymer and related monodisperse oligomers feature an effectively &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone&#8212;involving the B&#9552;P bonds&#8212;and they show fluorescence from a pyramidalized excited state as well as aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE).








Abstract
While the isoelectronic substitution of selected C&#9552;C by B&#9552;N units in &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds has evolved into a well&#8208;established concept to create novel hybrid materials with modified properties, the use of valence isoelectronic B&#9552;P units for such purposes has been hardly explored. Herein, we demonstrate substitutional doping of the famous optoelectronic organic polymer poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) with B&#9552;P linking groups for the first time. We report on the successful synthesis of a soluble polymer and a series of monodisperse oligomers of BP&#8208;PPV type. Our structural and photophysical investigations, supported by in&#8208;depth DFT calculations, evidence effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation along their backbone, which is similary pronounced as in their previously reported BN congeners. In addition, the novel BCP compounds show distinct fluorescence emission in solution and emission enhancement upon aggregation (AIEE), occurring from a P&#8208;pyramidalized excited state.

         <title>Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Migratory Insertion in a Bismuth Redox Platform: Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multicomponent reaction involving an aryl halide, an aldehyde, and a silane derivative, facilitated by low&#8208;valent bismuth redox catalysis under mild conditions. The protocol represents an unprecedented example of four elementary organometallic steps at a Bi center within the catalytic cycle. Experimental and computational studies indicate the involvement of intermediate species that supports a Bi(I)/Bi(III) cycle.








Abstract
Herein, we report a catalytic defluorinative arylation of aldehydes with (per) A fluoroarenes facilitated by a pincer&#8208;based PheBox&#8208;Bi(I) under mild conditions. The protocol features various novel aspects in bismuth redox catalysis; namely, (1) a catalytic 1,2&#8208;aryl migratory insertion to forge a C&#9472;C bond, (2) an unprecedented example of multicomponent reaction through four elementary organometallic steps at a Bi center, (3) an unusual strategy for Bi(I) compounds regeneration via O&#9472;Si reductive elimination. Experimental and computational studies aided in dissecting the various mechanistic aspects of the bismuth redox cycle.

         <title>Experimentally Guided Iterative Parameter Estimation for Predictive Chemical Oscillator Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an iterative, experimentally guided parameter estimation method to improve the predictivity of chemical oscillator models. This method enables the efficient identification of sustained oscillations in the Fmoc oscillator across diverse conditions. Culminating in the development of a new oscillating system with a different amine at its core in only two iterations of parameter estimation followed by model prediction.








Abstract
Chemical oscillators are fundamental to dynamic processes in biology, from circadian rhythms to metabolic regulation, inspiring efforts to design synthetic analogues for use in responsive materials, autonomous systems, and molecular computing. However, creating robust and tunable synthetic oscillators remains a major challenge due to the inherent complexity and difficulty of identifying conditions that support sustained oscillations. We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time&#8208;efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.

         <title>Judicious Use of Chalcogens in Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters Leads to OLEDs with Efficiencies Exceeding 36% and Showing Mild Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At doping ratios ranging from 1 to 12&#160;wt%, the BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se&#8208;based sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs exhibited nearly unchanged EL spectra with small FWHMs of 27&#8211;30&#160;nm and EQEmax of 36.4&#8211;43.1%. The BN&#8208;Se&#8208;based OLED exhibited low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQEs remaining at 36.7 and 31.8% at 100 and 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best EL performance among mono&#8208;boron MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs to date. 








Abstract
Strategies that produce OLEDs that simultaneously achieve outstanding electroluminescence efficiency, small efficiency roll&#8208;off, good stability, and high color purity remain in strong demand. Herein, we report how judicious decoration of a benzochalcogenophene onto the BCzBN core leads to an acceleration of reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) without sacrificing either color fidelity and photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL). Compared with BCzBN, the kRISC of BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se are accelerated to 2.5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 and 7.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 from 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;s&#8722;1, each with near&#8208;unity &#934;PLs. BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se show narrowband emission at 483&#160;nm (FWHM of 22&#160;nm) and 485&#160;nm (FWHM of 22&#160;nm). The corresponding non&#8208;sensitized OLEDs using BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se exhibited record&#8208;breaking maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 43.1 and 36.9%, without any external light extraction techniques. Furthermore, the BN&#8208;Se&#8208;based OLED showed ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQEs remaining at 36.7 and 31.8% at 100 and 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. These emitters do not easily suffer from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Even at 12&#160;wt% doping, the EQEmax of the OLEDs with BN&#8208;S and BN&#8208;Se were 36.7 and 36.4%, respectively, with mild efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQEs at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 of 19.1 and 30.8%, respectively), and nearly unchanged electroluminescence spectra.

Even at 12&#160;wt% doping, the EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of the OLEDs with &lt;b&gt;BN-S&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BN-Se&lt;/b&gt; were 36.7 and 36.4%, respectively, with mild efficiency roll-off (EQEs at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 19.1 and 30.8%, respectively), and nearly unchanged electroluminescence spectra.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient C&#9472;S Coupling in Thioether Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first single&#8208;atom catalyst for C&#9472;S cross&#8208;coupling, featuring atomically dispersed Cu sites on mesoporous carbon nitride. The catalyst enables efficient, selective, and recyclable thioether synthesis under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst resists sulfur poisoning and operates via a concerted, non&#8208;radical mechanism, enabling a novel, scalable, and sustainable method for pharmaceutically relevant thioethers.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in synthetic chemistry. However, the formation of carbon&#8211;sulfur (C&#9472;S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C&#9472;S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur&#8208;induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single&#8208;atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C&#9472;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C&#9472;S coupling and demonstrate the power of single&#8208;atom catalysts in addressing long&#8208;standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.

         <title>Crown Ether&#8211;Peptide Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of crown ether&#8208;peptide rotaxanes is reported, incorporating a broad range of canonical and unnatural peptides into a threaded peptide backbone without the need for additional nonamide template sites in the axle. The 24C8 macrocycle is locked on the glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane, allowing the formation of different kinetically stable positional isomers.








Abstract
We report on the metal&#8208;free active template synthesis of crown ether&#8211;peptide rotaxanes. A 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether&#8211;tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide&#8211;axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.

         <title>Distance&#8208;Dependence of Photo&#8208;CIDNP in Biomimetic Tryptophan&#8211;Flavin Diads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR and MRI are crucial in sciences, but their low sensitivity limits their use. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) offers a solution. This study explores structure&#8208;photo&#8208;CIDNP relationships in liquid&#8208;state NMR using biomimetic tryptophan&#8211;flavin diads with varying oligoproline linker lengths. Findings show significant hyperpolarization effects, especially in diads with six proline units. Insights from this work pave the way for advanced NMR and bio&#8208;MRI studies.








Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential tools in natural and life sciences, but their low sensitivity often hampers their applicability. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) offers a versatile and mild method to overcome this limitation. Here, we report on structure&#8208;photo&#8208;CIDNP relationship studies in liquid&#8208;state NMR utilizing a holistic approach. We synthesized biomimetic tryptophan&#8211;flavin diads with varying linker lengths composed of conformationally rigid oligoproline units. The predominant polyproline II (PPII) helical structure ensures consistent donor&#8211;acceptor distances. Photo&#8208;CIDNP NMR experiments revealed significant hyperpolarization effects, particularly in diads with six proline units, mimicking the spatial arrangement found in natural photoactive proteins. Our findings highlight the potential of these biomimetic diads to enhance nuclear hyperpolarization in NMR spectroscopy. This work provides valuable insights into the design of diads for efficient photo&#8208;CIDNP generation, paving the way for advanced studies in modern NMR and bio&#8208;MRI.

The predominant polyproline II (PPII) helical structure ensures consistent donor&#8211;acceptor distances. Photo-CIDNP NMR experiments revealed significant hyperpolarization effects, particularly in diads with six proline units, mimicking the spatial arrangement found in natural photoactive proteins. Our findings highlight the potential of these biomimetic diads to enhance nuclear hyperpolarization in NMR spectroscopy. This work provides valuable insights into the design of diads for efficient photo-CIDNP generation, paving the way for advanced studies in modern NMR and bio-MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition of Diynes via Vinyl Cations</title>

         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations has been disclosed, enabling the efficient and practical synthesis of valuable chiral polycyclic indoles with excellent yields and unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. This reaction features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations and the first enantioselective triyne cyclization for the construction of carbon stereocenters. 








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes represents an efficient and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the assembly of valuable chiral cyclic targets in a single step. However, this strategy traditionally relies on the cyclometallation process. Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3&#8208;b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Thermodynamics of Water Displacement from Binding Sites and its Contributions to Supramolecular and Biomolecular Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of a hard non&#8208;interacting sphere to a macrocyclic cavity has been investigated to expose the importance of cavity water as determinant of supramolecular and biomolecular binding affinity in aqueous solution. The results demonstrate that the thermochemical properties of water molecules present inside different macrocyclic receptors can largely increase or decrease their binding affinities, for example, for the popular host cucurbit[8]uril, as reported by Jeffry Setiadi, Frank Biedermann, Werner M. Nau, and Michael K. Gilson in their Research Article (e202505713).

         <title>Robust A&#8208;site Cation Engineering for Stable 2D High&#8208;n Tin Perovskite Homologs with Bridged Lasing Emission Gaps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating distinct A&#8208;site cations, a library of homologous 2D tin halide perovskites was synthesized. A&#8208;site cation engineering enables&#160;the continuous bandgap tuning (1.62&#8211;2.01&#160;eV) with minimal lattice mismatch (&lt;3.6%). The n&#160;=&#160;3 tin perovskites with multications exhibited exceptional phase stability, and the corresponding nanolasers bridged the emission gaps between single&#8208;A&#8208;cation analogs.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional high&#8208;n halide perovskites (e.g., n&#160;&#160;=&#160;3) offer a unique platform for stable, efficient optoelectronics by synergizing improved stability with bulk&#8208;like carrier transport. However, their development is hindered by the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between continuous bandgap tunability and structural integrity. Here, we report robust&#160;A&#8208;site cation engineering to overcome these limitations in n&#160;&#160;=&#160;3 tin perovskites. By incorporating distinct cations, we synthesized a library of homologous single crystals, including metastable&#160;(BA)2Cs2Sn3I10&#160;(BA+: butylammonium) via growth kinetics control. It is revealed that A&#8208;site cations critically govern structural symmetry, exciton&#8208;phonon coupling, lasing, etc. Tailoring cation composition enables&#160;the continuous bandgap tuning (1.62&#8211;2.01&#160;eV) with minimal lattice mismatch (&lt;3.6%). A&#8208;site cation engineering idealized the perovskite lattice and improved the crystal quality, e.g., the multication (BA)2Cs0.7MA0.4EA0.5GA0.4Sn3I10&#160;(MA+: methylammonium, EA+: ethylammonium, GA+: guanidinium) achieves a long carrier lifetime (15.1&#160;ns), nearly three times that of containing single A&#8208;site, and then increases diffusion length to &gt;1&#160;&#181;m. The n&#160;=&#160;3 tin perovskites with multication exhibited exceptional phase stability and the corresponding nanolaser bridged the emission gaps between single&#8208;A&#8208;cation analogs, delivering a low threshold and unprecedented stability.

         <title>Chiral Induction and Memory via Supramolecular Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The helical chirality of a dynamic crown&#8208;ether switch can, by light&#8208; or redox&#8208;switching to a prochiral state, be erased and subsequently stereoselectively re&#8208;formed by relaxation in the presence of a point&#8208;chiral ammonium guest. This unique supramolecular deracemization enables facile transfer and stable memory of chiral information.








Abstract
Chirality is intrinsic to nature, and control of molecular chirality remains at the forefront of the chemical sciences. The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.

This unique supramolecular deracemization enables facile transfer and stable memory of chiral information.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is intrinsic to nature, and control of molecular chirality remains at the forefront of the chemical sciences. The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetranitroazacalixarene captures cyanide reversibly via SNAr to form a metastable dianionic bis&#8208;Meisenheimer complex. Stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the dianionic adduct spontaneously regenerates the parent macrocycle under mild conditions. This dynamic, fuel&#8208;driven process can be finely tuned by the counterion, concentration, solvent, and temperature.








Abstract
An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.

This image illustrates a Fe(II)&#8208;based Hofmann clathrate incorporating redox&#8208;active ligands, where electron transfer is highlighted. The three&#8208;dimensional framework represents the crystalline organization, while the spheres and curves depict the electronic motion within the material. This electron transfer is correlated with Marcus theory, explaining the coupled modulation of the redox potential and the spin transition temperature. Details are reported by Saioa Cobo et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202506965).

The anion vacancies triggered spin polarization enables efficient piezocatalysis for water cleanup is described by Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu and Huan He et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202507265). The cover image illustrates an anion vacancy&#8208;triggered spin polarization strategy to efficiently convert organic pollutant into carbon monoxide (CO) with fast kinetics. The unpaired spin electrons of Fe and Mo atoms can effectively interact with the carbon reduction intermediates, not only promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH, but also provides spin electrons to enhance *COOH adsorption and reduces activation barriers.

In their Research Article (e202507071), Yongbin Zhuang et al. propose a new framework that combines on&#8208;the&#8208;fly probability&#8208;enhanced sampling and machine learning potential techniques for studying the oxygen evolution reaction at oxide&#8208;water interfaces. This framework is applied to the study of BiVO4 materials and successfully predicts that proton transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step, while electron transfer is mediated by the Bi&#9472;O bond in the first proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of the oxygen evolution reaction.

Narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet and pure deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials were developed by Y. Kitamoto et al. in their Communication (e202510891). The TADF materials, a new family of N,N&#8208;bridge&#8208;type and N,N,O&#8208;bridge&#8208;type triphenylboranes, was synthesized via halogen&#8208;free directed tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions followed by nucleophilic substitution reactions. The present synthetic strategy and molecular design rely on ether groups.

         <title>Enhanced Cycling Performance of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode via a Vaccine Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface spinel&#8208;like layer serves as a vaccine inoculated in the initial layered structure. During initial 70 cycles, the Mg located in Li slab gradually migrates to the bulk and act as a pillar against further structural collapse, by this way the layered structure merges with the spinel&#8208;like layer into a partially disorder phase. This process is like the vaccine taking its function. With the help of the in situ formed partially disorder phase, deep cycling stability is finely enhanced, with no capacity fade after 500 cycles.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;component incorporation and its inoculated gradient disorder structure can greatly modify the properties of materials. However, the contribution of the inoculated surface gradient disorder structure on the Li&#8208;rich cathodeswith distinctive integrated structure of LiMO2 (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Mn, Co) and Li2MnO3 has been overlooked. Here, we reveal a vaccine effect of surface gradient disorder structure, demonstrating its significant improvement on the cycling performance of inoculated Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. The inoculated Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of 85% and maintains ultra&#8208;high stability with 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, it delivers a capacity of 154.5 mAh g&#8722;1 with 84.2% retention after 900 cycles at current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Through a combination of electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulations via the basic Nernst equations, we demonstrate that the inoculated gradient disorder structure changes the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the lattice oxygen redox process, which follows three sequential steps O2&#8722;&#8594;O22&#8722;&#8594;O2&#8722;&#8594;O2. This structural modification reconstructs the lattice oxygen redox, specially enhancing the electrode potential of the O2&#8722;&#8594;O2 step and reducing the reaction rate of O2&#8722;&#8594;O22&#8722;&#8594;O2&#8722; of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. These findings bring a novel perspective on the conventional foreign element incorporation strategy, providing valuable insights to support the continued development of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Breaking Bonds at Tin(II): Reductive or Oxidative Addition?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typically, the addition of a chemical bond to a metal centre is assumed&#9472;without question&#9472;to be an oxidative process. Here, through studies of bond addition to tin(II), we reveal a spectrum ranging from &#8216;oxidative&#8217; (Cl&#9472;Cl) to &#8216;reductive&#8217; (Be&#9472;Be) processes, with other bonds (B&#9472;B, B&#9472;H, H&#9472;H) falling between these two extremes.








Abstract
Here, the addition of H&#9472;H, Be&#9472;Be, B&#9472;B, and B&#9472;H bonds to SnII is studied by experimental and theoretical means. We report the first examples of B&#9472;B and Be&#9472;Be bond additions to a main group metal centre, along with the first example of borazine B&#9472;H bond addition to any element of the Periodic Table. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the classification of these reactions as prototypical &#8220;oxidative&#8221; addition processes may be misleading and that a more nuanced description is warranted.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanisms Behind Structural Repair of Spent Layered Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural repair is key to direct recycling, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. By combining XRD, XAS, and 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR, this study identifies a repair process involving re&#8208;lithiation, oxygen capture, transition&#8208;metal oxidation, and migration for LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 layered cathode &#8212;governed by temperature and lithium compensation. An atomic&#8208;level repair mechanism is thus proposed, offering valuable insights into cathode performance recovery.








Abstract
Structural repair is a vital step in the direct recycling of spent LiNixCoyMnzO2 lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently clear. Herein, the thermal solid&#8208;state structural repair of spent LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) layered cathode material is systematically investigated. Through multiscale techniques combining XRD, XAS, and 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR, we identify the structural degradation in spent NCM622 and monitor both long&#8208; and short&#8208;range structural evolution during repair. Our findings reveal that degradation predominantly occurs through Ni migration into Li octahedral sites, while Co and Mn demonstrate relatively lower occupancies in the Li layer. Such occupancies are primarily responsible for structural disorder and cubic&#8208;symmetry domain formation within the spent material. The repair process is demonstrated to involve re&#8208;lithiation, oxygen capture, increased transition metal (TM) oxidation states, and the migration of TM ions from the Li layer back to the TM layer, followed by cation diffusion. Both temperature and lithium compensation ratio are identified as critical factors promoting these processes. Capacity recovery studies show a strong correlation between reduced TM occupancy in the Li layer and improved electrochemical performances. These insights allow us to move beyond conventional phase&#8208;transition perspectives, offering an atomic&#8208;level understanding of structural degradation and repair mechanisms in spent layered cathode materials.

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Active Site Exposure Using C60 Fullerenolamine Enable High&#8208;Performance Alcohol Oxidation on Pd Metallene Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through Pd&#8208;NH&#8322; coordination bonding, C60 fullerolamine (FA) was successfully anchored onto the Pd metallene (Pdene) surface. This surface functionalization induces an electron&#8208;deficient state in Pd through charge redistribution while simultaneously enhancing the electrochemical active surface area. The resulting electron&#8208;deficient Pd sites demonstrate optimized adsorption behavior toward ethanol oxidation intermediates. These synergistic effects endow FA&#8208;Pdene to exhibit enhanced mass activity and specific activity for ethanol oxidation compared to Pdene.








Abstract
The availability of active sites and the electronic structure of metal heterogeneous catalysts are crucial to maximize their catalytic performance. In this study, we describe a new and efficient catalyst system, C60 fullerenolamine (FA)&#8208;modified Pd metallene (Pdene), and demonstrate that the FA molecules not only increase the active sites availability but also exert an electronic effect that enhances the catalytic performance of Pdene in alcohol oxidation reactions. Specifically, FA increases the electrochemical active surface area through dispersion, while its electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics induce an electron&#8208;deficient surface on Pdene, which facilitates the adsorption of electron&#8208;rich intermediates (OH*) and the desorption of electron&#8208;deficient poisonous intermediates (CO*). The practical significance of this modification is demonstrated by achieving a 54.5% increase in mass activity and 46.3% enhancement in specific activity for ethanol oxidation relative to Pdene. Beyond these improvements, the FA&#8208;Pdene catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability, superior CO poisoning resistance, and enhanced C1 pathway selectivity. An in&#8208;depth analysis utilizing in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory calculations, offers valuable insights into how the FA ligand modulates the mechanistic pathways involved in ethanol oxidation processes. This fullerene&#8208;mediated catalytic effect could hold the key to unlocking the potential of the metal&#8208;based system.

         <title>Engineering a Meltable MOF to Tune Liquid Transition and Promote Coenzyme Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a liquid&#8211;liquid transition process, a bimetallic glassy MOF is fabricated. It has exceptional glass&#8208;forming properties, evenly distributed bimetallic ions, and a markedly higher visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photogeneration efficiency of enzymatically active NADH.








Abstract
Modulating the liquid phase of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) presents new opportunities for functionalizing glassy MOFs, expanding the fundamental science and practical application for this emerging family of materials. Herein, we report the fabrication of a bimetallic glassy MOF via a liquid&#8211;liquid transition process. This is achieved by introducing a robust Schiff base&#8211;cobalt functional group into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62, which attracts negatively charged imidazolate ligands, facilitating low&#8208;temperature melting. This ultimately leads to the formation of a bimetallic glassy MOF (Co/Zn&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62&#8208;ipy) upon melt&#8208;quenching. The material features an exceptionally high glass&#8208;forming capability, uniformly distributed bimetallic ions, and a markedly enhanced visible light photogeneration efficiency of enzymatically active nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) when compared with Co&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;62 glass. These findings offer novel insights into modulating the liquid phase of an MOF to develop functional glassy MOF photocatalysts for coenzyme NADH regeneration and other advanced applications.

         <title>Synergistic Stabilization of Pt Single Atoms by Cl and Ru for Industrial&#8208;Scale Current Density Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atom, synergistically stabilized by Cl ligand and Ru support, exhibits excellent stability over 1000&#160;h of PEM water electrolysis testing while drastically reducing the Pt loading as low as 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysts are considered ideal cathodic materials for PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) due to their excellent atom utilization and tunable local coordination environment, yet their durability for practical applications remains an unresolved challenge. Herein we report the Pt SAs, synergistically stabilized by Cl&#8208;ligand and Ru nanoparticles, exhibit both high activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A key finding is that the dynamically evolved Pt&#8211;Cl&#8211;Pt coordination structure protects Pt SAs against aggregation. Theoretical analysis reveals the unique electronic structure of Pt SAs is finely tuned through the synergistic role of Ru and Cl, resulting in a notable stabilization of Pt SAs. PEMWE with such a catalyst at an ultra&#8208;low Pt loading delivers a cell voltage of only 1.66&#160;V at a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2, while maintaining the outstanding electrocatalytic and structural stability of the Pt&#8211;Cl&#8211;Pt coordination over 1000&#160;h, thus providing an application potential of SA catalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Controlled Lysine&#8208;Selective Crosslinking Decodes Protein Complexes and Dynamic Interactomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled lysine&#8208;selective crosslinking (VL&#8208;XL) strategy is introduced for exploring protein complexes and dynamic interactomes in live cells. By synergistically integrating the advantages of temporal control, high biocompatibility, and lysine selectivity, VL&#8208;XL provides a robust chemical tool for proteomics and drug discovery, which is expected to inspire innovative solutions to address unresolved questions across multiple fields.








Abstract
Crosslinking strategies have emerged as an attractive technology for deciphering protein complexes and protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). However, commonly used crosslinking strategies present significant challenges for the precise analysis of protein complexes and dynamic PPIs in native biological environments. Here, we report the development of the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;inducible lysine&#8208;specific homobifunctional photo&#8208;crosslinkers and introduce Visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled Lysine&#8208;selective crosslinking (VL&#8208;XL) strategy for in&#8208;depth analysis of protein complexes and profiling dynamic interactomes in live cells. By synergistically integrating the advantages of temporal control, high biocompatibility, and lysine selectivity, the VL&#8208;XL strategy not only provides an effective solution for protein complexes studies&#8212;achieving residue&#8208;specific crosslinked peptides, delivering high&#8208;confidence data and streamlined mass spectrometry (MS) data analysis&#8212;but also reveals dynamic interactomes in various scenarios. The VL&#8208;XL strategy successfully profiles the time&#8208;resolved, epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interactome, providing valuable insights into regulatory mechanisms of EGFR signaling. More importantly, the VL&#8208;XL strategy effectively unveils molecular glue degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome, leading to discovery of neo&#8208;substrates such as Sestrin&#8208;2 (SESN2) and opening an innovative avenue for identifying novel targets for degradation. Overall, the VL&#8208;XL strategy provides&#160;a robust chemical tool, inspiring innovative solutions to address unresolved questions in multiple fields.

         <title>Anion Vacancies Triggered Spin Polarization Enables Efficient Piezocatalysis for Water Cleanup</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an anion vacancy&#8208;triggered spin polarization strategy to efficiently convert organic pollutant into carbon monoxide (CO) with fast kinetics. The unpaired spin electrons of Fe and Mo atoms can effectively interact with the carbon reduction intermediates, not only promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH, but also provides spin electrons to enhance *COOH adsorption and reduces activation barriers.








Abstract
The conversion of aromatic organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks is still suffering from sluggish carbon reduction kinetics with spin&#8208;forbidden transitions. Here, we report an anion vacancy&#8208;triggered spin polarization strategy to efficiently convert phenol into carbon monoxide (CO) with fast kinetics. The creating Se vacancies (Vse) stimulate the spin polarization of both Fe and Mo in Fe single atom modified MoSe2 (Fe/MoSe2), in which spin polarization can enhance the quantity of spin electrons and facilitate the transport of electrons that share the same spin direction with greater efficiency in charge separation. Batch experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the unpaired spin electrons of Fe and Mo atoms not only accelerate the formation and immobilization of key intermediate *COOH, but also provide spin electrons for *COOH further cleavage with a lower reaction energy barrier. Moreover, profiting from the crucial bridging role of peroxydisulfate (PDS), phenol can be first oxidized to carbonate/CO2 through PDS activation and then provide a sufficient carbon source for CO formation with favorable reaction kinetics. Impressively, the Fe/MoSe2 piezocatalysis coupled with PDS exhibits 298.28&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1 CO production rate for phenol degradation with over 60&#160;h durability.

         <title>Contrasting Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts Supported on CeOx Nanoislands with Various Ligand Environments Including Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis from chloride&#8208;containing metal salts gave metal complexes chemisorbed on the supported CeOx nanoislands, having a structure approximated as Pt1Cl2O4. Calcination removed Cl and transformed the adsorbed Pt1Cl2O4 to Pt1O6, embedded within the support and without Cl ligands. Moderate Cl coordinated with Pt exhibits the highest catalytic performance, while excess Cl ligands block the metal sites and inhibit the catalytic activity.








Abstract
Metals that are dispersed atomically on supports offer new and potentially valuable catalytic properties associated with their high atom efficiencies and opportunities for tuning their electronic properties by choice of the support and other ligands bonded to them. Herein, we report the synthesis of atomically dispersed Pt, Rh, and Ir anchored on CeOx nanoislands on a high&#8208;area SiO2 support. Synthesis from chloride&#8208;containing metal salts gave metal complexes chemisorbed on the supported nanoislands, with Pt being prototypical and having a structure approximated as Pt1Cl2O4, as shown by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and calculations at the level of density functional theory (DFT). Calcination converted the adsorbed species into a structure represented as Pt1O6, embedded in the CeOx lattice. The Pt1Cl2O4 was observed to have a higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation than the chloride&#8208;free, embedded Pt1O6 species, and DFT results indicate the role of chloride in enhancing the catalytic activity of the isolated Pt, in contrast to its role as an inhibitor when Pt is present as nanoparticles. This work emphasizes the importance of the first coordination shell in controlling the catalytic properties of atomically dispersed noble metals.

         <title>Unveiling Roles of Nonradical Electron&#8208;Donation Pathway in Peroxymonosulfate Activation for Boosted Interfacial Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study revealed a previously overlooked synergy between radical and nonradical pathway in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Key findings included dual electron migration paths for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation: besides the electron provided by Co centers, donated electrons from nonradical participated in PMS activation. This synergy boosted reactive species generation and utilization by shortening radical attack distances.








Abstract
In conventional studies, radicals and nonradicals were often considered independent mechanisms for organic pollutant oxidation, with their potential interaction between radicals and nonradicals largely overlooked in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Herein, Cu&#8208;Co3O4 catalysts (x&#160;wt% Cu&#8208;Co3O4/OVs) featuring bifunctional bonding centers were fabricated, which enabled simultaneous co&#8208;capture of electron&#8208;rich contaminants and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) at their interfaces. The optimized 0.75&#160;wt% Cu&#8208;Co3O4/OVs demonstrated exceptional efficiencies in degrading diverse micropollutants through synergistic oxidation pathways involving radicals and nonradical electron transfer process (ETP). Significantly, we found the unique dual electron migration pathways for PMS activation during synergistic oxidation process: besides the electron donation from Co centers, electron could be migrated via ETP from micropollutants to Co sites via heteroatomic Cu, serving as additional electron source for assisting PMS activation. In addition, synergistic oxidation pathways not only enhanced the generation of reactive species but also improved their utilization efficiency by shortening the migration distance of radicals. Such system exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability (up to 16&#160;h) in wastewater treatment, with its environmental applicability further validated through life cycle assessment and bio&#8208;experiments. This work uncovered a previously unrecognized synergistic interaction between radical and nonradical pathways, offering new insights into the interfacial radical&#8208;mediated oxidation behavior for advanced wastewater remediation.

         <title>Intracellular CO2 Capture Triggered Outperforming Biocatalytic Production of Selective Acetic Acid and Biohydrogen Housing in Porous&#8208;Organic&#8208;Nanofiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

A novel electrofermentation platform using VJ&#8208;POP, a polycarbazole&#8208;based porous polymer, enhances intracellular CO&#8322; capture, enabling selective acetic acid (2.11&#160;g L&#8722;1) and biohydrogen production by Bacillus subtilis without genetic modification. VJ&#8208;POP improves electron transfer, CO&#8322; adsorption, and metabolic specificity, offering a scalable solution for sustainable CO&#8322; valorization.








Abstract
The increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) necessitates innovative biocatalytic strategies for its utilization in sustainable chemical production. This study introduces a novel electrofermentation (EF) platform integrating polycarbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer (VJ&#8208;POP)&#8208;coated electrodes to enhance selective acetic acid (AA) biosynthesis by Bacillus subtilis. Impressive high surface area and tailored porosity facilitate efficient CO&#8322; capture, modulate intracellular metabolic fluxes, and improve electron transfer, thereby driving product specificity. In the bioreactor equipped with VJ&#8208;POP, AA production reached 2.11&#160;g L&#8722;1 with a yield of 0.48&#160;g g&#8722;1, achieving 71% of the theoretical maximum without genetic modifications. The process also resulted in enriched biohydrogen content (52%) in the biogas (H2&#160;+&#160;CO2) composition, highlighting the synergistic effect of VJ&#8208;POP on CO&#8322; sequestration and microbial metabolism. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of ackA (acetate kinase) and pdhA (pyruvate dehydrogenase), while buk (butyrate kinase) was downregulated, ensuring metabolic selectivity toward AA. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis unambiguously confirmed an interesting phenomenon of enhanced electron transfer and reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance in VJ&#8208;POP&#8208;assisted systems. Computational analysis using density functional theory (DFT) revealed stronger binding energy for CO2 (&#8722;17.4&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) compared to H2 (&#8722;2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1), driven by a mix of van der Waals and weak electrostatic interactions for CO2 versus solely weak van der Waals&#8208;based physisorption for H2. This pioneering approach with unique investigation results presents a scalable and sustainable biocatalytic framework for CO&#8322; valorization, bridging material science and microbial electrochemical systems for selective AA and enhanced biohydrogen production.

         <title>Mn/TiO2 Catalysts for the High&#8208;Yield Partial Oxidation of Methane with Molecular Oxygen to a Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn/TiO2 is a highly active catalyst for the conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl trifluoroacetate using molecular oxygen as an oxidant. Different Mn/TiO&#8322; catalysts with varying properties demonstrate a correlation between Mn dispersion and reducibility, and catalytic activity. Notably, around 30% yields were obtained, confirming the effectiveness of Mn/TiO2 for the partial oxidation of methane in acid to a stable methyl ester.








Abstract
We synthesize and evaluate a diverse range of Mn/TiO2 catalysts with varying physical and redox properties for the methane&#8208;to&#8208;methyl&#8208;ester reaction using molecular oxygen in a diluted acid medium (10 wt% trifluoroacetic acid). Despite initial differences in manganese distributions, nearly all catalysts are active under the reaction conditions, and the degree of activity is partially correlated to catalyst reducibility in hydrogen temperature programmed reduction and manganese K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Under methane&#8208;limited conditions, exceptionally high product yields of up to ca. 30% are obtained. Catalysts synthesized with a co&#8208;precipitation method demonstrate the highest productivity (up to 1440&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) in methane&#8208;excess conditions, and their full activity can be restored in a subsequent reaction cycle upon a mild thermal treatment. Under high conversion conditions, the co&#8208;precipitated catalyst can achieve methane&#8208;based product yields of ca. 15%. The performance of Mn/TiO2 catalysts using molecular oxygen under less corrosive conditions surpasses that of other heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Multivariate MOF Hollow Fiber Membranes with Precision&#8208;Tuned Subnanometer Channels Toward Aromatic Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate MOF (MTV&#8208;MOF) hollow fiber membranes with precision&#8208;tuned subnanometer channels were fabricated by leveraging the heterogeneous spatial distribution of ligands, where reduced coordination energy barriers drive the formation of alternating narrow&#8208;wide channels. This configuration achieves highly efficient membrane separation of aromatic hydrocarbons with reduced transport resistance. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes exhibit great potential for molecular separations, but it remains a considerable challenge to achieve precise pore aperture regulation, typically requiring the synthesis of distinct MOF structures for each targeted separation. Herein, the first multivariate MOF (MTV&#8208;MOF) hollow fiber membranes with precision&#8208;tuned subnanometer channels have been fabricated by leveraging the heterogeneous spatial distribution of ligands, where reduced coordination energy barriers drive the formation of alternating narrow (local&#8208;path limited) and wide channels, simultaneously addressing the critical permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in membrane separations. The alternating narrow&#8208;wide channel architecture has been systematically investigated through combined density functional theory calculation, molecular dynamics simulation and mathematical modeling, with direct experimental validation provided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and quantitative adsorption analysis. These MTV&#8208;MOF membranes demonstrated the ability to selectively separate aromatic hydrocarbons achieving highly selective separation while reduce the molecular transport barriers, offering significant potential for industrial separation processes.

         <title>Atomically Engineered Acridine Derivatives Serve as Metal&#8208;Free and Self&#8208;Sensitized Catalysts for Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 to Formic Acid with High&#8208;Efficiency and Near&#8208;Perfect Selectivity</title>

We reported the design and first discovery of acridine derivatives (DADN, PXZN, and PTZN) as new&#8208;type, metal&#8208;free, self&#8208;sensitized catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and selective light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to formic acid is a significant scientific challenge, particularly when utilizing purely organic, metal&#8208;free, and earth&#8208;abundant element&#8208;based molecule photocatalysts. Herein, we first reported the discovery of acridine derivatives (DADN, PXZN, and PTZN) as new&#8208;type, metal&#8208;free, self&#8208;sensitized molecule catalysts that enabled exceptional performance in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to formic acid. Notably, the atomically engineered sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycle PTZN demonstrated unprecedented formate yield rate of 47.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &gt;99% selectivity in a photocatalytic system using 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;3&#8208;ium (BI+) as proton and electron relay. The superior activity of PTZN was revealed to arise from its synergistic combination of strong CO2&#8208;binding affinity (&#8722;0.195&#160;eV), prolonged charge&#8208;separated states (11&#160;ns), and robust CO2 electronic coupling (2.51&#160;eV). Comprehensive studies including in situ electron spin resonance, in situ infrared, and transient absorption spectroscopy unambiguously unveiled a direct single electron transfer process from the excited singlet&#8208;state acridine derivatives to CO2, generating CO2&#183;&#8722;. Moreover, a hydrogen atom transfer process utilizing in situ generated BIH as a hydrogen atom carrier enabled the conversion of CO2&#183;&#8722; to formic acid. This work establishes the first demonstration of a sequential proton&#8211;electron transfer mechanism in acridine&#8208;based photocatalysis, resolving long&#8208;standing challenges in proton and electron delivery during CO2 activation.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation for the Construction of Fluoro, Chloro, and Trifluoromethyl Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;hydride catalyzed enantioconvergent hydroalkylation with allenes and alkenes is achieved with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. This method allows the streamlined synthesis of enantiomerically enriched C(sp3)&#8211;fluorine, &#8211;chlorine, and &#8211;trifluoromethyl stereocenters.








Abstract
Organic compounds containing a chiral, halogenated aliphatic carbon center are useful in medicinal chemistry, but their enantioselective synthesis remains difficult. Here, we develop a general approach to access these compounds through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of allenes and alkenes with dihaloamides. The reactions of allenes and terminal alkenes lead to alkylation only at the terminal position. In contrast, the reactions of internal alkenes occur via chain&#8208;walking and alkylation at the terminal position. These reactions operate by enantioconvergent transformation of racemic secondary alkyl halides to give enantio&#8208;enriched products. The method exhibits broad scope and high chemo, regio, and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated by further transformations of the products as well as the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex substrates.

An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid uniformly&#8208;stacked 2D crystal [Be2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(C7H3NO4)(H2O)]&#183;H2O involving hydrogen bond synthons was designed and successfully synthesized, exhibiting strong covalent tetra&#8208;coordinated BeII cations that coordinate with the O and N atoms on birefringence&#8208;active &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; organic groups with optimal spatial arrangement. The crystal demonstrates unprecedented birefringence in the solar&#8208;blind wide UV&#8208;transparent region.








Abstract
Giant birefringent crystal with large bandgap is of paramount importance for modern optical devices but simultaneous achievement of giant birefringence and large bandgap is a great challenge stemming from their inherent contradictory relationship according to Kramers&#8210;Kronig equation. Herein, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid uniformly&#8208;stacked 2D crystal [Be2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(C7H3NO4)(H2O)]&#183;H2O (I) was successfully synthesized by a molecular crystal engineering involving hydrogen bond synthons. Layered I features new [Be2O2N(&#956;&#8208;OH)2(H2O)]&#8734; helical chain composed of BeII tetrahedral coordination, and the strong covalent BeII cations coordinate with the O and N atoms on birefringence&#8208;active &#960;&#8208;conjugated (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; organic groups with optimal spatial arrangement. As a result, I demonstrates the largest birefringence of 0.6 in the solar&#8208;blind UV spectral region, with large bandgap of 4.75&#160;eV and short UV absorption edge of 261&#160;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses uncover that the superior optical properties mainly originate from collective effects of highly&#8208;active (C7H3NO4)2&#8722; groups, distorted Be&#8208;tetrahedral units, and their uniform stacking. This work not only provides a potential solar&#8208;blind UV birefringent crystal for rapidly increasing number of optical applications but also a new chance for the rational design of wide UV giant birefringent crystals.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Customizable Library of Nickel Trifluoromethylation Catalysts via Selective C&#9472;F and C&#9472;O Bond Cleavage</title>

Carbatranes and anionic pincer ligands were self&#8208;assembled via one&#8208;pot C&#9472;F or C&#9472;O bond cleavage and the formation of C&#9472;O, C&#9472;N, or C&#9472;C bonds, forming ligand architectures inaccessible by common synthetic methods. This approach allowed to build a customizable library of nickel catalysts for light&#8208;induced C&#9472;H bond trifluoromethylation. Carbatrane ligands support nickel in +3 and +4 oxidation states allowing for their direct reactivity comparison.








Abstract
Using a combination of metal&#8208;promoted reactivity, in situ covalent bond modification, and hydrogen bonding&#8208;promoted fluorine labilization, a unified approach was developed to self&#8208;assemble a library of customizable ligand architectures directly at the nickel center via selective cleavage of C&#9472;F or C&#9472;O bonds and the formation of C&#9472;C or C&#9472;N bonds. As a result, a structurally diverse set of nickelacarbatrane and pincer complexes was obtained, including unsymmetrical and mixed&#8208;heterocyclic atranes and trifluoromethylated pincers that cannot be accessed by conventional organic synthetic methods or require multiple steps and a tedious and low&#8208;yielding separation. This suggests a possibility of a spontaneous generation of high&#8208;complexity structures from a commonly used metal precursor and simple N&#8208;heterocycle building blocks, despite commonly believed innocence of the C&#9472;F bonds, which may also generate catalytically active species.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Electrocatalytic Oxidative C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage in Lignin Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic oxidative provides a promising alternative to cleaving C&#9472;C bond for converting lignin biomass into high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction usually competes in the aqueous environment. Herein, we successfully recognized that the in situ formed reactive oxygen species O2&#8722; during OER could synergize with the lignin intermediates to facilitate C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage, without additional exogenous oxidants.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidative cleavage of the C&#9472;C bond is highly effective for converting lignin biomass into high&#8208;value&#8208;added aromatic chemicals. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at applied oxidative potential usually competes in the aqueous environment. In this study, we found that OER does not entirely hinder the cleavage process but rather acts as a synergistic catalytic step. By using defect&#8208;rich carbon nanotubes as the electrocatalyst and combining experimental and theoretical analysis, we found that the reactive oxygen species (O2&#8722;) formed before *O2 desorption serve as the key oxygen source. These species could interact with the enolate intermediate of lignin, which facilitates the in situ production of aromatic compounds. Under the optimal potential of 0.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl, 98.8% of 2&#8208;phenoxyacetophenone is converted into phenol and benzoic acid via C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage, with yields of 62.31% and 43.42%, respectively. Additionally, the depolymerization of quasi&#8208;natural poplar lignin achieves a total monomer yield of up to 12.41&#160;wt%. This study provides new mechanistic insights into C&#945;&#9472;C&#946; bond cleavage during electrocatalytic lignin depolymerization under alkaline conditions, contributing to efficient biomass valorization.

         <title>Multi&#8208;ion Coordinated Water Network in Dilute Acid Electrolytes for Ultralow&#8208;Temperature (&#8804;&#8722;80 &#176;C) Proton Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong&#8208;super&#8208;cooling dilute acid electrolyte with stable multi&#8208;ion coordinated water network is developed, which effectively disrupts the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through the synergetic effect between Zn2+ and ClO4&#8722; to promote proton transport. Consequently, the electrodes and hybrid proton capacitors deliver excellent rate performance and ultralow&#8208;temperature stability.








Abstract
Proton batteries/capacitors, known for fast ion diffusion kinetics, are a promising alternative for low&#8208;temperature energy storage. However, ultralow&#8208;temperature (&#8804;&#8722;60 &#176;C) proton energy storage devices have been impeded by the strong corrosion of high&#8208;concentration acids and the high freezing point of low&#8208;concentration acids. Here, a strong&#8208;super&#8208;cooling electrolyte with a multi&#8208;ion coordinated water network (hybrid electrolyte of dilute acid and chaotropic zinc salt) is designed for fast proton transport at low temperatures. The chaotropic zinc salt not only reduces the number of free water but also minimizes the number of strong hydrogen bonds in the electrolyte, thus inhibiting the transition of the water molecules to an ordered arrangement at low temperatures. More importantly, the formation of stable Zn2+&#8722;H2O&#8722;ClO4&#8722; water molecule network, driven by strong interactions between ions, can effectively improve the proton transport to achieve the excellent rate performance of electrodes. This electrolyte also enables a long cycle life of the assembled CuHCF//&#945;&#8208;MoO3 for over 15&#160;000 cycles below&#160;&#8722;60 &#176;C, expediting the development of proton energy storage devices at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Harnessing Bifunctional N&#8208;Benzoyloxyamides for Photoredox Amidative Dual Functionalizations of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalytic strategy is presented for intermolecular amidative dual functionalization of alkenes using N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides as bifunctional N&#9472;O reagents. The method enables efficient olefin 1,2&#8208;amidooxygenation and significantly extends its reactivity to encompass amidoazidation, diamination, and formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation. By harnessing the reactivity of both amidyl radicals and O&#8208;nucleophiles via mesolytic N&#9472;O bond cleavage, this approach demonstrates a unified platform for dual amido&#8208;functionalization of olefins utilizing both radical and ionic reaction pathways.








Abstract
Here, we present a photocatalytic strategy for the intermolecular dual functionalizations of alkenes using N&#9472;O bifunctional reagents in an atom&#8208;economical fashion. By leveraging N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides as bifunctional precursors for generating both amidyl radical and internal O&#8208;nucleophiles, this approach achieves chemoselective olefin amidation with simultaneous incorporation of additional functional groups. The current method readily accesses a range of doubly functionalized amino products through 1,2&#8208;amidooxygenation, amidoazidation, and formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroamidation. Mechanistic studies revealed that the selective interplay of radical and ionic pathways is operative to enable a unified platform for this olefin dual functionalization.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Alterations of Protein Polyubiquitination Revealed by Mass&#8208;Spectrometric Ubiquitome Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To monitor small molecule&#8208;induced changes in protein polyubiquitination in an unbiased manner, we employ enrichment through tandem ubiquitin binding entities coupled to LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis (TUBE&#8208;MS). By applying the workflow to PROTAC, p97&#8208; and deubiquitinase&#8208;inhibitor treatment of cells, we demonstrate its broad applicability and reveal the induction of non&#8208;degradative ubiquitination on the E3 ligase UBE3A upon inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP7.








Abstract
Small molecules that alter protein ubiquitination are emerging as therapeutics due to their ability to modulate targets previously deemed undruggable. These compounds comprise PROTACs, molecular glue degraders, and DUB inhibitors, among others. However, methods for the proteome&#8208;wide monitoring of compound&#8208;induced changes in protein polyubiquitination, which may also detect non&#8208;degradative modifications, are lacking. Here, we report the utilization of polyubiquitin enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry to monitor small molecule&#8208;induced changes in cellular protein ubiquitination. We established enrichment through tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs) following semi&#8208;denaturing cell lysis and devised an elution protocol compatible with downstream LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the workflow by assessing ubiquitination changes induced by a PROTAC, a p97 inhibitor, and deubiquitinase inhibitors. Application of the assay to compounds inhibiting the deubiquitinase USP7 revealed the induction of non&#8208;degradative ubiquitination on the E3 ligase UBE3A. Collectively, we established a versatile proteomics method to facilitate the direct investigation of cellular polyubiquitination, with high relevance for the identification and characterization of protein degraders, stabilizers, and other molecules with ubiquitin&#8208;mediated bioactivity.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Ethylene or Ethanol via Tuning *OH Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the rational design of Cu defect sites with different *OH affinities for the selective CO2 reduction to produce C2H5OH or C2H4. Grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;rich Cu gives weaker *OH favors C2H5OH formation and amorphous Cu defect sites showed stronger *OH facilitates C2H4 formation. We achieved a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 29.0&#8201;% for C2H5OH and an impressive high full&#8208;cell EE of 25.6&#8201;% for C2H4, respectively.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) into ethylene (C2H4) or ethanol (C2H5OH) is a high challenge. In this study, the rational manipulation of Cu defect sites was realized for the selective formation of C2H5OH and C2H4. Low&#8208;coordination amorphous and medium&#8208;coordination grain&#8208;boundary Cu defect sites with different *OH affinity were found to play a decisive role in the selective protonation of CH2CHO*. In particular, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;rich Cu (denoted as Cu&#8208;1) that weakly adsorbed *OH and CH2CHO* favored the protonation on &#946;&#8208;C of CH2CHO*, leading to the selective production of C2H5OH. In contrast, amorphous Cu defect sites (denoted as Cu&#8208;3) showed strong *OH adsorption and then strong CH2CHO* adsorption, facilitating C&#8722;O breaking and C2H4 formation. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configuration, a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 29.0&#8201;% for C2H5OH on Cu&#8208;1 and an impressive high full&#8208;cell EE of 25.6&#8201;% for C2H4 on Cu&#8208;3 were observed. In addition, a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.4&#177;1.5&#8201;% was achieved on Cu&#8208;3 at a notable current of 12.5&#8197;A with a 25&#8197;cm&#8722;2 MEA configuration. These results provided crucial insights into the significance of defect sites in manipulating the adsorption of *OH for the selective production of C2H4 or C2H5OH.

In their Research Article (e202506570), Jingwei Hou, Wengang Huang and co&#8208;workers developed a bimetallic MOF glass (Co/Zn&#8208;agZIF&#8208;62&#8208;ipy) via a liquid&#8211;liquid transition, incorporating Schiff base&#8211;Co units. The resulting glass shows high glass&#8208;forming ability, uniform metal dispersion, and enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. This work presents a novel strategy to tune MOF liquid phases for stable, non&#8208;noble metal photocatalysts mimicking enzymatic function.

In their Research Article (e202505634), Feilong Xing, Hideo Hosono, Masaaki Kitano, and co&#8208;workers report that CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is facilitated at room temperature on adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites on the hcp&#8208;PdMo catalyst. Mo acts as the reaction site for the activation of CO2 into CO and O, while Pd serves as the H2 dissociation site. The ordered structure of the hcp&#8208;PdMo catalyst enhances the transfer of H atoms from Pd to Mo sites, facilitating the hydrogenation of CO intermediate on Mo to form CH3OH and simultaneously reducing the Mo sites even at room temperature.

         <title>Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Mediators for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Element&#8211;Carbon Bond Homolysis in Main Group Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the facilitation of E&#9472;C bond homolysis of main group compounds with visible light by the coordination of redox non&#8208;innocent ligands. Important conceptual coherencies, potential applications, and future challenges are highlighted with respect to selected literature reports.








Abstract
Photoinitiated homolysis of element&#8211;carbon bonds is an important method for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals in catalysis and organometallic or polymer chemistry. In this respect, the use of earth&#8208;abundant main group elements such as aluminum or silicon is attractive. Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox&#8208;inactive elements are unstable and within their high&#8208;valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#9472;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#9472;C homolysis usually requires shortwave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#9472;C homolysis is possible when a redox non&#8208;innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the NILs provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8211;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#9472;C bond. In this article, the effects of NILs as mediators for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#9472;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Photoinitiated homolysis of element&#8211;carbon bonds is an important method for the generation of carbon-centered radicals in catalysis and organometallic or polymer chemistry. In this respect, the use of earth-abundant main group elements such as aluminum or silicon is attractive. Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox-inactive elements are unstable and within their high-valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#9472;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#9472;C homolysis usually requires shortwave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible-light-induced E&#9472;C homolysis is possible when a redox non-innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the NILs provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8211;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#9472;C bond. In this article, the effects of NILs as mediators for visible-light-induced E&#9472;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Janus Superiority of Membranes in Chemical Engineering and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

This review explores the Janus superiority of membrane materials in chemical engineering processes, with a focus on their design and fabrication principles, transport mechanisms, and diverse applications. It highlights their roles in chemical engineering and their multiscale impacts and concludes by discussing current challenges and future research directions. 








Abstract
Janus configurations, characterized by their inherent asymmetry, enable directional mass transfer in membrane materials that drive novel and energy&#8208;efficient chemical processes. This Janus superiority spans applications from nanoscale molecular and ionic transport to macro&#8208;scale separation systems with asymmetric spatial architectures. This review provides an analysis of the material foundations including design principles, structure regulation, and scalability challenges underlying Janus membranes. We explore the physics that governs their unique behavior and examine their diverse applications across chemical engineering, including phase transfer, and molecular or ionic transport. Through a multiscale perspective, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Janus superiority in advancing chemical engineering technologies. Finally, we discuss the hurdles in translating theoretical advances into practical applications and propose promising avenues for future research to harness the full potential of Janus membranes and systems in addressing global challenges related to energy, sustainability, and beyond.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Phase Heterostructured Catalysts for Oxygen Electrocatalysis with Lattice Oxygen Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imitating the hydrolysis behavior existing in natural geological processes, LaNiO3 nanoparticles are quenched in FeSO4 solution to accelerate the hydrolysis of Fe2+ and construct heterostructured LaNiO3/Fe(OH)3 catalyst, and then the differential thermal expansion between the core&#8208;shell is utilized to promote the re&#8208;quenching regulation of the three&#8208;phase interface, thus transforming the catalytic pathway of LaNiO3/Fe2O3&#8208;Co from AEM to LOM with reduced OER Gibbs free energy.








Abstract
Lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction can overcome the scaling relations&#8208;induced limitations imposed by conventional adsorption evolution mechanism, but faces challenges in maximizing activation of lattice oxygen species. The flexible structure of three&#8208;phase heterostructured catalysts provides the possibility for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis, yet still face the bottleneck of synthesis difficulty and insufficient regulation. Herein, a facile quenching route is proposed for the synthesis of core&#8208;shell catalysts, and the influence mechanism of three&#8208;phase heterostructure on quenching engineering is elucidated. High&#8208;temperature LaNiO3 nanoparticles are quenched in FeSO4 solution to construct a LaNiO3/Fe(OH)3 core&#8208;shell structure by inducing rapid hydrolysis of Fe2+. The differential thermal expansion coefficient between LaNiO3 and Fe2O3, as well as the three&#8208;phase interfaces composed of core&#8208;shell structure and amorphous/crystalline phases in Fe2O3 shell, result in significant surface/interface regulation for LaNiO3/Fe2O3 core&#8208;shell catalysts during re&#8208;quenching in Co(NO3)2 solution, including richer lattice distortion and defects, and more heteroatom doping. The derived three&#8208;phase heterostructured catalysts exhibit significantly improved oxygen electrocatalytic activity with lattice oxygen participation, and the assembled liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries show excellent output power density and cycling performance. Our finding provides important insights into the synthesis of three&#8208;phase heterostructured catalysts and the regulation of heterogeneous interfaces through quenching engineering.

         <title>Dynamic Photoacoustic Imaging of Mobile Cu(II) in Vivo via Catalytic Radical Cation Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel design strategy based on catalytic radical cation formation to develop molecular probes capable of in vivo photoacoustic imaging of mobile Cu(II) in the shortwave infrared region. We detail the development of this strategy and demonstrate its application through high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of mobile Cu(II) dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease model mice.








Abstract
Copper dyshomeostasis is associated with various diseases, making in vivo spatiotemporal imaging of mobile Cu(II) dynamics crucial for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms. However, imaging mobile Cu(II) dynamics remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the limitations of conventional probes in distinguishing between mobile and bound Cu(II). Herein, we developed a design strategy based on catalytic arylamine radical cation formation, enabling the creation of photoacoustic probes with superior sensitivity and micron&#8208;resolution imaging capabilities in the short&#8208;wave infrared region, specifically in response to mobile Cu(II). In vivo imaging of the brains of Parkinson's disease model mice revealed significant alternations in mobile Cu(II) levels within the cerebral cortex and cerebellar lobules during early disease stages, suggesting that these regions are particularly vulnerable to Cu(II) accumulation in early Parkinson's disease. These findings underscore the significant potential of these probes for investigating mobile Cu(II) dynamics and their role in physiological and pathological processes.

         <title>Library of Stereoregular Polythioesters for Stereocomplex Formation Enabled by Isomerization&#8208;Driven Cationic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled and racemization&#8208;free/suppressed IROPs of nine chiral five&#8208;membered thionolactones have been achieved, which allows an unprecedented access to a library of new stereoregular polythioesters. Studies on the relationship structure&#8211;stereocomplexation lead to the disclosure of two new polythioester crystalline stereocomplexes and also offer mechanistic insights into the formation ability.








Abstract
Supramolecular stereocomplexation is an important tool to advance sustainable polymers, and oxygen&#8208;containing polymers represent the most widely studied materials for stereocomplexation. However, the sulfur&#8208;containing analogues, a newly emerged class of sustainable polymers, remain essentially unexplored because of a significant challenge encountered in the synthesis of stereoregular polymers and relatively low supramolecular interaction. In this contribution, by the utilization of [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; as a metal&#8208;free cationic initiator, controlled isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (IROPs) of nine examples of chiral five&#8208;membered thionolactones have been achieved with free or suppressed racemization via unique monomer&#8208;stabilized SN2 propagation mechanism, which allows an unprecedented access to a library of new stereoregular polythioesters with high isotacticities (80.0%&#8211;99.5%). The investigations into structure&#8211;stereocomplexation relationship led to the disclosure of two new polythioester stereocomplexes with high melting temperatures (117.0&#8211;161.0&#160;&#176;C). The fundamental aspects of stereocomplex formation mechanism and critical factors that affect stereocomplexed ability have also been revealed.

         <title>A Platform for the Development of Highly Red&#8208;Shifted Azobenzene&#8208;Based Optical Tools</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our platform is built on a combination of chemical synthesis, NMR, UV&#8211;vis, and quantum chemical studies. The dfdc azobenzene scaffold provides efficient photoswitching with red light and the ability to fine&#8208;tune relaxation times. A TD&#8208;DFT&#8208;based workflow allows the in silico design of photoswitches with properties tailored to desired applications. The strong potential is demonstrated by the development of a red light&#8208;operated TRPC6 activator.








Abstract
Azobenzenes are versatile photoswitches that can be used to generate elaborate optical tools, including photopharmaceuticals. However, the targeted application&#8208;guided design of new photoswitches with specific properties remains challenging. We have developed synthetic protocols for derivatives of the dfdc (di&#8208;ortho&#8208;fluoro&#8208;di&#8208;ortho&#8208;chloro) azobenzene scaffold with chemical alterations in the para&#8208;/ortho&#8208;positions and performed an in&#8208;depth study into the effects of their structures on their photophysical properties with an emphasis on the n&#160;&#8594;&#160;&#960;* absorption band using NMR, UV&#8211;vis, and X&#8208;ray analysis. The data was used to establish and validate a computational approach that allows to compute realistic UV&#8211;vis spectra by combining TD&#8208;DFT excited&#8208;state calculations from 6000 thermally accessible structures generated through MD simulations while considering the high structural flexibility of ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes. We added 15 new visible light&#8208;operated photoswitches to the toolbox for the development of optical devices with relaxation rates across multiple orders of magnitude and identified several examples with stronger bathochromic shifts than the dfdc azobenzene lead structure. Our combined experimental and computational study forms the foundation for the advanced in silico design and synthesis of new highly red&#8208;shifted photoswitches. To showcase the potential of dfdc azobenzenes for the development of chemical tools, we synthesized dfdc&#8208;OptoBI&#8208;1 and demonstrated its biological activity as a red light&#8208;operated activator of TRPC6 channels in HEK293 cells.

         <title>Energetics Modulation for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mobile ions in perovskite films would trigger ion migration and self&#8208;accelerating chemical degradation. Here we propose an energetics modulation strategy by developing the electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinecarboxaldehyde oxime to modulate the ionization energy and energy level structure of perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions. The optimized devices demonstrate enhanced efficiency of 26.13% with an operating lifetime of T88&#160;=&#160;1000 h.








Abstract
The operational stability of n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under heat, air, and humidity has notably improved over recent years. Yet, performance degradation under light and voltage bias remains a concern for their commercial deployment. One of the main causes of such degradation relates to mobile ions in the perovskite film, which can trigger ion migration and self&#8208;accelerating chemical degradation. Here, we propose an energetics modulation strategy by developing the electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinecarboxaldehyde oxime (PO) ligand for FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The introduction of PO ligands increases the ionization potential of the perovskite, inhibiting the generation of mobile ions during the crystallization process and subsequent device operation. Furthermore, this additive promotes the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts, which can help to regulate the energy level of perovskite and facilitate charge transport to the contact stacks. As a result, the optimized n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs exhibit a high efficiency of 26.13% and maintain over 88% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h maximum power point (MPP) tracking test under 1 sun illumination. This work underlines the importance of energetics modulation for inhibiting intrinsic perovskite degradation that cannot be achieved by mere device encapsulation.

         <title>Ternary Potassium&#8208;Bismuth&#8208;Telluride Intermetallic Support Promotes Electrochemical Stability in Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the enhanced performance of potassium metal batteries enabled by a ternary potassium&#8208;bismuth&#8208;telluride intermetallic synthesized via accumulative roll bonding. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nano tomography and cryogenic focused ion beam microscopy reveal the uniform electrodeposition on the intermetallic in contrast to the porous baseline. Multiscale simulation provides&#160;insight into adatom energetics, film nucleation, early&#8208;stage SEI morphology and interfacial stability.








Abstract
We employed accumulative roll bonding to fabricate self&#8208;standing metallurgical composite of in situ formed alkaline potassium&#8208;bismuth&#8208;telluride intermetallic K2(Bi2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) embedded in potassium metal. This newly discovered thermodynamically stable potassiophilic crystal, termed &#8220;KBT&#8221;, is fcc antifluorite with K2Te archetype. Symmetric cells achieve 880 h of cycling at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Potassium metal battery (KMB) with Prussian blue (PB) cathode in carbonate electrolyte retains&#160;80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1C. In ether&#8208;based electrolyte with organic cathode, it achieves&#160;80% retention&#160;after 900 cycles at 2C. Combined synchrotron X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;tomography, cryogenic&#8208;focused ion beam microscopy (Cryo&#8208;FIB)&#160;and sputter&#8208;down X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate uniform electrodeposits, versus baseline of potassium filaments intermixed with pores and coarse SEI. Binary K3Bi&#8208;K and K2Te&#8208;K intermetallic supports also provide improved electrochemical performance, albeit to lesser extent. Multiscale simulation provides&#160;insight into role of support structure in adatom energetics, film nucleation, early&#8208;stage&#160;SEI&#160;morphology and interfacial stability.

         <title>Flexible&#8208;Linked Oligomeric Acceptors: Precise Synthesis and Enhanced Photovoltaic/Mechanical Properties for Stretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three oligomeric acceptors with progressively increasing molecular weights, named 2YF&#8208;Br (3649&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), 4YF&#8208;T (7222&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), and 6YF&#8208;BT (10&#160;953&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1), were precisely synthesized. Remarkably, the optimized molecular weight of the acceptors simultaneously achieved enhanced photovoltaic efficiency, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness. The acceptor with the largest molecular weight (6YF&#8208;BT) facilitated the highest crack&#8208;onset strain (25.92%) and the exceptional device stretchability (strain at PCE80%&#160;=&#160;35%).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are among the most promising technologies for wearable power applications. However, the development of electron acceptors that simultaneously meet the demands for high performance and mechanical stretchability remains a significant challenge. In this study, we creatively synthesized three oligomeric acceptors with flexible linkers (2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT) and achieved both high efficiency and mechanical robustness in IS&#8208;OSCs. Benefiting from an improved fibrous morphology and excellent charge dynamics, rigid OSCs based on 4YF&#8208;T demonstrated a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.76%, outperforming devices based on 2YF&#8208;Br and 6YF&#8208;BT. Additionally, the thermal stability of rigid OSCs progressively improved with increasing molecular weight, from 2YF&#8208;Br to 6YF&#8208;BT. Furthermore, the enlarged molecular weight of the acceptors significantly enhanced mechanical stretchability, with crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 16.11%, 20.62%, and 25.92% for 2YF&#8208;Br, 4YF&#8208;T, and 6YF&#8208;BT, respectively. Importantly, as molecular weight increased, the mechanical robustness of IS&#8208;OSCs also improved, with 6YF&#8208;BT&#8208;based devices achieving remarkable stretchability (strain at PCE80%&#160;=&#160;35%). This study introduces a new class of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight acceptors with well&#8208;defined structures, paving the way for the advancement and practical application of IS&#8208;OSCs in wearable electronics.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Accelerates Electrochemically Driven Single&#8208;Molecule Oxidative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic configuration of a single&#8208;molecule junction was arbitrarily modulated from flat to titled using 1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (HMIMPF6). When combined with electrochemical modulation, the final upright configuration can promote the bond&#8208;forming reactions to obtain the azo molecules.








Abstract
Molecular adsorption covers a broad spectrum of chemical processes and device fabrications at solid/liquid interfaces. The unraveling of the underlying mechanisms relies on regulating molecular adsorption. However, achieving such regulation at the single&#8208;molecule level remains a challenge. Herein, we utilized a combined ionic liquid and scanning tunneling microscope break junction methods to tune single 4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline molecules gradually from the flat configuration to the upright one and found that only the upright configuration can trigger the oxidative coupling. Experimental and theoretical findings demonstrated that the ionic liquid reduced the electron density of the Au electrode, giving rise to the evolution of the interaction between molecule and electrode from the Au&#8208;&#960; dominated coupling to the Au&#8208;&#963; dominated one. This work will inspire the exploration of strategies that can control the molecular assembly, accelerate the chemical reaction, and promote the fabrication of organic devices.

         <title>&#8220;Rigid Exterior, Soft Interior&#8221; Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage Polyether Electrolytes for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel high&#8208;voltage polyether electrolyte with &#8220;rigid exterior, soft interior&#8221; design is developed, which involves a 3D F&#8208;contained network as rigid exterior framework, and a unique solvation structure with intensified Li+&#8208;anion coordination as soft interior within the framework. Such electrolyte induces salt&#8208;philic, solvent&#8208;phobic interfacial films for stabilizing electrolyte/electrode interphases toward superior quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Polyether electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity and excellent interfacial contact have garnered significant attention. Yet further applications of such electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries are severely hindered by the instability of the electrolyte and electrolyte/electrodes interphases. Here, we report a novel high&#8208;voltage polyether electrolyte with a &#8220;rigid exterior, soft interior&#8221; design, which involves a 3D F&#8208;contained network as a rigid exterior framework, and a unique solvation structure with intensified Li+&#8208;anion coordination as a soft interior within the framework. The achieved electrolyte demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 1.13 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, a Li+ transference number of 0.85, and an extended electrochemical stability window of over 5&#160;V. Besides, such a designed polyether electrolyte further induces salt&#8208;philic, solvent&#8208;phobic interfacial films for stabilizing electrolyte/electrode interphases. An exceptional cyclability in a Li||Li cell for over 4000&#160;h, and a preferable capacity and cyclability in even 4.6&#160;V Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are demonstrated. Meanwhile, the resulting 4.3&#160;V Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 QSSB shows a Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;100% and an extremely high capacity retention of 95.4% after 600 cycles at 3C. A capacity retention of over 96.3% after 400 cycles at 1C are further realized in 4.5&#160;V Li||NCM811 QSSB.

         <title>Selective Production of Acetylene from the C&#9472;C Coupling Reaction of CH4 with CO2 Mediated by Ta2O2+ Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling reaction between CH4 and CO2 to selectively produce the C2 hydrocarbon of C2H2 has been successfully realized at room temperature mediated by the active Ta2O2+ cluster. The prereaction of Ta2O2+ with CH4 evokes an in situ reconstruction of Ta&#9472;O&#9472;Ta to Ta&#9472;CCH4&#9472;Ta, which serves as the actual reactive site to delicately control the sequential elementary reactions targeted for H&#9472;CCH4&#8801;CCO2&#9472;H generation.








Abstract
Coconversion of methane and carbon dioxide to C2 hydrocarbons via the CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling reaction is of great significance to mitigate greenhouse effect and develop an alternative route for manufacture of important industrial feedstocks (e.g., C2H2), however, it has not yet been achieved so far owing to the difficulty in breaking both of the C&#9552;O bonds in CO2 as well as the precise control of sequential elementary reactions targeted for C2 hydrocarbons. Herein, by using the tantalum oxide Ta2O2+ as an active cluster, an unprecedented CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling reaction of CH4 with CO2 to exclusively produce the C2 hydrocarbon of C2H2 has been successfully realized even at room temperature by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mass spectrometry. The in situ reconstruction from Ta&#9472;O&#9472;Ta cluster skeleton to tantalum carbide Ta&#9472;C&#9472;Ta experienced upon the prereaction with CH4 is critical to delicately control the sequential elementary reactions targeted for C2H2 generation. This finding not only leads to a breakthrough in the field of gas&#8208;phase and condensed&#8208;phase chemistry wherein the C2+ oxygenated compounds were the mainstream products for CCH4&#9472;CCO2 coupling of CH4 with CO2, but also explores a new active structure and a novel reaction mechanism beneficial for selective production of C2 hydrocarbons from coconversion of CH4 and CO2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coconversion of methane and carbon dioxide to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons via the C&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling reaction is of great significance to mitigate greenhouse effect and develop an alternative route for manufacture of important industrial feedstocks (e.g., C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), however, it has not yet been achieved so far owing to the difficulty in breaking both of the C&#9552;O bonds in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as the precise control of sequential elementary reactions targeted for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons. Herein, by using the tantalum oxide Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as an active cluster, an unprecedented C&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling reaction of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively produce the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbon of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been successfully realized even at room temperature by the state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. The in situ reconstruction from Ta&#9472;O&#9472;Ta cluster skeleton to tantalum carbide Ta&#9472;C&#9472;Ta experienced upon the prereaction with CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is critical to delicately control the sequential elementary reactions targeted for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. This finding not only leads to a breakthrough in the field of gas-phase and condensed-phase chemistry wherein the C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenated compounds were the mainstream products for C&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;C&lt;sub&gt;CO2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also explores a new active structure and a novel reaction mechanism beneficial for selective production of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons from coconversion of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Conjugated Polymers by Selective Methyl/Methylene C&#9472;H Activation on Gold Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl/methylene C&#9472;H bonds are selectively activated on gold surfaces using predesigned monomers with methylthiophene moities, leading to the successful synthesis of vinylene linkages with a yield of up to 97%. The strong adsorption of the thiophene ring on the gold substrate effectively lowers the energy barriers for methyl and methylene C&#9472;H dissociation, facilitating the two&#8208;step dehydrogenation required for the formation of vinylene&#8208;linked polymers.








Abstract
Vinylene (C&#9552;C) linkage facilitates the distribution of highly conjugated electrons along the polymer chain, thereby playing a crucial role in the development of conductive polymers for promising applications in organic electronics. Directly connecting two methyl groups to construct a vinylene linkage would streamline the synthesis process considerably, reducing the number of reaction steps required. However, reactions through alkyl groups normally form C&#9472;C single bonds as linkages. Achieving vinylene bonds via further dehydrogenation remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of vinylene linkages by selectively activating methyl/methylene C&#9472;H bonds using the predesigned monomers bearing methylthiophenes on Au(111) and Au(110) surfaces. Noncontact atomic force microscopy confirms the formation of vinylene linkage by bond&#8208;resolved imaging on both surfaces, achieving a vinylene linkage yield of 97%. Density functional theory calculations and control experiments reveal that the strong adsorption of the thiophene ring on the gold substrate effectively reduces the energy barriers for methyl and methylene C&#9472;H dissociation, enabling the two&#8208;step dehydrogenation for the formation of vinylene&#8208;linked polymers with up to 27 units. Our findings present a novel strategy for polymerization or oligomerization via vinylene linkages on surfaces.

         <title>An Engineered Multivalent TMV Nanodisk Platform for Modulating Integrin Clustering and Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Receptor clustering is essential for efficient signal transduction and cellular function. Here, a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)&#8208;based platform provides a stable scaffold for clustering up to 34 ligands with defined spacing, dramatically enhancing receptor binding and signaling. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies (TMV&#8208;SPPEPS) demonstrate its ability to promote integrin clustering, driving MSC differentiation and therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Clustering of cell&#8208;surface receptors is essential for initiating signaling cascades and regulating cellular functions. Multivalent ligands with high receptor affinity offer powerful tools for manipulating these processes and advancing therapeutic strategies. However, designing easily modifiable, stable, and uniformly structured multivalent ligands remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a novel protein&#8208;based platform derived from modified tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein, which assembles into a stable, discoid scaffold capable of displaying up to 34 ligands with evenly distributed binding sites. By introducing the T103C modification, we achieve exceptional structural stability, allowing the platform to maintain integrity across a broad pH range (5&#8211;11) and during long&#8208;term storage (up to 6 months). Using the integrin&#8208;binding peptide SPPEPS as a model, we generate a multivalent TMV&#8208;SPPEPS that exhibits a 453&#8208;fold increase in integrin affinity over the monomeric peptide and can simultaneously cluster up to seven integrins. This multivalent platform promotes integrin clustering on cell surfaces, triggering mesenchymal stem cell chondrogenesis and effectively alleviating osteoarthritis in a rat model. These results highlight the potential of the TMV nanodisk as a versatile and stable platform for controlling receptor clustering and modulating intracellular signaling in diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Lattice Distortion Promoting Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Emissions in Cu(I)&#8208;Based Halides for Thermography and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize (DMAP)Cu3I4 single crystals with wavelength&#8208;tunable emission from red to NIR, attributed to energy transfer from CC to XMCT. A high thermal sensitivity (0.0001&#8208;0.6&#160;K&#8722;1) and high spatial thermography with spatial resolution up to &#8722;20&#160;lp mm&#8722;1 were achieved by engaging characteristics of wavelength&#8208;tunable emission in (DMAP)Cu3I4&#8208;based films.








Abstract
Low dimensional hybrid metal halides as a chemically tunable platform achieve multi&#8208;functional optical applications with versatile luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we design and prepare Cu(I)&#8208;based hybrid halide (DMAP)Cu3I4 (DMAP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine), with ambient temperature&#8208;induced photoluminescence evolution from red to near&#8208;infrared emissions. The in situ variable&#8208;temperature crystallographic study reveals lattice distortion with more disordered [Cu3nI4n]n&#8722; units appear at high temperature, further indicating that the observed wavelength&#8208;tunable emission is attributed to transitions from Cu cluster center to halogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. Thus, (DMAP)Cu3I4 shows a compelling thermometric precision (high sensitivities of 0.0001&#8211;0.6&#160;K&#8722;1) at a wide temperature range of 80&#8211;300&#160;K. In particular, the remote thermography is established with a high spatial resolution of &#8722;20&#160;lp mm&#8722;1 by processable thin films. These findings enhance the potential for molecular&#8208;level illumination in Cu(I)&#8208;based halides and contribute to the exploration of their optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Patch&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Like Micropipette Electrode with Exterior and Interior Interfaces for Simultaneous Monitoring of Extracellular and Intracellular Serotonin Across Neuron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created a patch&#8208;clamp&#8208;like micropipette electrode with double sensing interfaces, together with surface serotonin binding protein modification and protein engineering, a potentiometric serotonin electrochemical sensor with broadened linear range was created for both intracellular and extracellular serotonin recording with excellent selectivity, reversibility and biocompatibility. Our findings revealed serotonin transporter reversed function to release 5&#8208;HT before intracellular exocytosis enhanced during seizures.








Abstract
Simultaneous monitoring of intracellular and extracellular serotonin (5&#8208;HT) across five orders of magnitude is crucial for understanding 5&#8208;HT&#8208;related diseases. Here, we created a patch&#8208;clamp&#8208;like micropipette electrode with double sensing interfaces, in which gold nanoparticles were coated onto exterior surface and conductive hydrogel was in situ polymerized by designed monomer to form interior interface. Furthermore, we engineered serotonin binding protein (SerBP) as recognition element to develop open&#8208;circuit potentiometric 5&#8208;HT sensor and modulated SerBP to enhance dissociation constant toward 5&#8208;HT through key residue mutation to broaden the linear ranges by five orders of magnitude for both intracellular and extracellular 5&#8208;HT recording. Meanwhile, the designed noninsertion mode together with zero potential detection caused minimal cell damage, thus significantly prolonged the recording duration. Using this powerful tool, we first discovered 5&#8208;HT transporter reversed function to release 5&#8208;HT before intracellular exocytosis enhanced, and together, through the release&#8211;reuptake&#8211;metabolism cycle, dynamically regulate the concentration of 5&#8208;HT with the development of seizure.

Here, we created a patch-clamp-like micropipette electrode with double sensing interfaces, in which gold nanoparticles were coated onto exterior surface and conductive hydrogel was in situ polymerized by designed monomer to form interior interface. Furthermore, we engineered serotonin binding protein (SerBP) as recognition element to develop open-circuit potentiometric 5-HT sensor and modulated SerBP to enhance dissociation constant toward 5-HT through key residue mutation to broaden the linear ranges by five orders of magnitude for both intracellular and extracellular 5-HT recording. Meanwhile, the designed noninsertion mode together with zero potential detection caused minimal cell damage, thus significantly prolonged the recording duration. Using this powerful tool, we first discovered 5-HT transporter reversed function to release 5-HT before intracellular exocytosis enhanced, and together, through the release&#8211;reuptake&#8211;metabolism cycle, dynamically regulate the concentration of 5-HT with the development of seizure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Ligand and Target Discovery by Using &#946;&#8208;Nitrostyrene Electrophiles: Supporting Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene as a reversible covalent warhead for both target discovery and the construction of small&#8208;molecule degraders. Several ligandable proteins that modulate cell proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia were identified. This warhead effectively induced target protein degradation by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM28. These findings establish a rational design strategy for developing potent monvalent degraders with therapeutic potential. 








Abstract
Bioconjugation chemistry has been a powerful avenue in expanding the repertoire of druggable proteome, as well as in identifying new E3 ligases to support targeted protein degradation (TPD). However, a large fraction of proteome remains inaccessible with existing covalent probes. Herein, we incorporated various electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into styrene derivatives and identified &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene as a cysteine&#8208;targeting reversible covalent warhead for target discovery. Through phenotypic screening and chemoproteomics platforms, we identified new ligandable sites such as C96 of SND1, C110 of PTGES2, modulating cell proliferation in an acute myeloid leukemia cell line. Moreover, incorporation of this warhead into the BRD4 inhibitor (+)&#8208;JQ1 demonstrated that the covalent handle engages the novel E3 ligase tripartite motif&#8208;containing 28 (TRIM28) at Cys232 residue, thereby promoting the targeted degradation. Notably, when transplanted into other protein&#8208;targeting ligands, the &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene warhead effectively induced protein degradation of EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S, PDE5, BTK, LRRK2, and BCR&#8208;ABL/c&#8208;ABL without eliciting a hook effect. Importantly, the degraders demonstrate significantly enhanced antcancer effects compared to corresponding inhibitors. To our knowledge, this is the first report of small&#8208;molecular degraders engaging TRIM28 to support targeted protein degradation, and provides a rational pathway for design and development of potent monovalent degraders.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Doping: Sulfur&#8208;Induced Electronic and Interfacial Dynamics for Advanced Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers that sulfur doping simultaneously narrows the bandgap of Co3O4 and disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks of H2O within the electric double layer. This not only reduces the electron transfer barriers but also promotes H2O dissociation for nitrate hydrogenation. The &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy presented here sets up a transformative paradigm for proton&#8208;coupled reactions.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) offers a sustainable route for NH&#8323; synthesis and environmental remediation, yet it is hindered by sluggish kinetics due to inefficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and inadequate electrocatalyst design. Conventional approaches primarily focus on the bulk electronic modulation of the electrocatalyst while neglecting interfacial water dynamics. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;functional sulfur&#8208;doping strategy in Co3O4 (S&#8208;Co3O4) to simultaneously enhance bulk conductivity and optimize interfacial proton transfer. Through innovative benzene sulfonyl chloride blocking experiment, in situ spectroscopic analyses, and kinetic isotope effect studies, we reveal that sulfur doping narrows the bandgap of Co3O4 to enhance bulk charge transport while disrupting rigid hydrogen&#8208;bond network of water in the electric double layer; the weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded H2O reduces the dissociation barrier and facilitates proton supply for nitrate hydrogenation. The proposed &#8220;electronic&#8208;interfacial synergy&#8221; strategy establishes a transformative paradigm for designing electrocatalysts in PCET&#8208;driven reactions, advancing sustainable energy conversion and environmental applications.

         <title>Promoting the Rate Performances of Weakly Solvating Electrolyte&#8208;Based Lithium&#8210;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weakly solvating electrolyte&#8208;based lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries exhibit poor rate performances due to intrinsic sluggish kinetics of polysulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur with high activation polarization and reduced electron transfer number. A redox mediation strategy is proposed to promote elemental sulfur deposition and achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;rate lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Employing weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) effectively alleviates the polysulfide shuttle effect and improves the cycling lifespan. However, the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE is highly sluggish to render degraded rate performances. Herein, the sulfur cathode kinetics of WSE&#8208;based Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically investigated to help promote the rate performances in practical pouch cells. Concretely, the sluggish cathode kinetics of the previous charging process is identified as the main limitation for specific discharge capacity loss at high rates. Further polarization decoupling manifests activation polarization corresponding to polysulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur constitutes the dominant kinetic challenge. Accordingly, a redox mediation strategy is proposed to accelerate the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics of polysulfide oxidation in WSE. 3 Ah&#8208;level pouch cells cycle stably under a high rate of 0.2 C, and 5 Ah level pouch cells achieve an actual energy density of 470&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work deepens the comprehension of the sulfur cathode kinetics in WSE and highlights the redox mediation strategy in achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;rate Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity Spatiotemporal Cholesterol Detection by Quadrature Phase&#8208;Shifted Polarization Stimulated Raman Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing quadrature phase modulation, the phase&#8208;shifted polarization SRS (QP2&#8208;SRS) microscope enables simultaneous measurement of the &#961;&#8208;related &#967;1111(3)$\chi _{1111}^{( 3 )}$ and &#967;1221(3)$\chi _{1221}^{( 3 )}$ components. In cholesterol molecular measurements, QP2&#8208;SRS leverages the structural differences between cholesterol and other biomolecules to enhance chemical identification and enable sensitive, real&#8208;time cholesterol detection in living systems.








Abstract
Visualizing cholesterol dynamics in living systems in situ remains a fundamental challenge in biomedical imaging. Although fluorescence microscopy requires bulky tags that perturb small molecule behavior, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy enables label&#8208;free detection of CH&#8208;rich molecules. However, conventional SRS probes only polarized Raman components, limiting molecular specificity by seemingly overlapped peaks. Here, we extend SRS microscopy to achieve rapid, comprehensive detection of Raman tensor through quadrature phase&#8208;shifted polarization SRS (QP2&#8208;SRS) microscopy. This technique exploits the underlying molecular signatures by detecting both polarized and depolarized components of third&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(3) that originates from molecular structural features. We adopt a specialized optical delay line that rapidly alternates between parallel&#8208; and perpendicular&#8208;polarization states. QP2&#8208;SRS enables unprecedented distinction of similar molecular species in complex mixtures, demonstrating approximately 10&#215; enhancement in chemical specificity and 5&#215; improvement in analytical accuracy. This enhanced sensitivity enables real&#8208;time monitoring of lipid dynamics in living C. elegans and reveals component heterogeneity and morphological changes of LD in NAFLD livers. QP2&#8208;SRS creates new opportunities for investigating cholesterol&#8208;dependent biological processes in their native environment, with broad potential for chemical imaging with enhanced molecular specificity.

         <title>Relay&#8208;Enhanced Electron Transfer in Triple&#8208;Layer Ru@Ir@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for the Ammonia Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a triple&#8208;layer Ru@Ir@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst for the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR)&#8212;a key process in using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. A relay electron transfer strategy driven by built&#8208;in electric fields minimizes N2 adsorption and lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. The catalyst achieves 363.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (5.24&#160;&#215;&#160;commercial Pt/C), with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability in a Zn&#8211;NH3 battery.








Abstract
Ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is important for enabling the efficient use of NH3 as a promising carrier for hydrogen storage and transportation. However, the catalytic activity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts decreases significantly due to the strong adsorption of N species. In this study, a triple&#8208;layer core&#8211;shell structured Ru@Ir@Pt model catalyst was employed to demonstrate that the relay electron transfer strategy can decelerate the adsorption of N species and increase AOR activity, a process facilitated by the built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) induced by differing work functions that drive the sequential relay of charge transfer across the interfaces between different metals. In situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that AOR proceeds primarily via the N2H4 pathway of the G&#8211;M mechanism. Both the experimental and theoretical simulation results confirm that relay electron transfer induced by a built&#8208;in electric field enables the outermost Pt electron&#8208;rich state to reduce the intensity of N adsorbed species and lower the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step in the AOR, resulting in excellent activity with a mass activity reaching up to 363.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This value is 5.24 times higher than that of 20%&#160;Pt/C and significantly surpasses most previously reported catalysts. This work presents a novel material design approach for developing high&#8208;performance advanced ammonia oxidation electrocatalysts.

         <title>Origin of Room Temperature Methanol Synthesis over Hcp&#8208;PdMo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hexagonal close&#8208;packed PdMo (hcp&#8208;PdMo) intermetallic catalyst exhibits the room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanism study revealed that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water&#8208;gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;C) pathway though a Pd&#8208;assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has garnered significant interest with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions; however, the high temperatures and pressures typically required diminish the benefits of this approach. In this study, we report a hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;PdMo catalyst that exhibits the highest room temperature catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol among reported catalysts, with 100% methanol selectivity and without any signs of deactivation. Structural analyses, which included various in situ and ex situ X&#8208;ray techniques and infrared spectroscopy, have revealed that Mo and Pd serve as the active sites for CO2 adsorption and H2 dissociation, respectively. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction is facilitated at room temperature on the surface of the hcp&#8208;PdMo intermetallic catalyst, where the adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites play important roles in methanol synthesis. Mechanistic studies, combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a reverse water&#8208;gas shift and subsequent CO hydrogenation (R&amp;C) pathway though a Pd&#8208;assisted Mo redox mechanism at room temperature. These findings not only reveal the origin of the reaction mechanism for methanol synthesis but also open a new direction for the design of highly efficient catalysts that function under mild conditions.

         <title>Modulation of Lanthanide Luminescence with the Mechanical Bond: Antenna&#8208;Emitter Confinement in a Compact [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent lanthanide emitters typically need sensitization from an attached chromophore &#8211; an &#8220;antenna&#8221; &#8211; to have useful emission intensities. Here we show that the mechanical bond can be used to connect the antenna to the emitter, providing unique stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to the resulting assemblies. The resulting lanthanide&#8208;capped [2]rotaxanes are easy to synthesize, give good emission intensities and act as efficient metal ion sensors.








Abstract
Luminescent emitters based on lanthanide ions are of ubiquitous importance in the biological sciences, but typically need sensitization from a covalently attached adjacent chromophore &#8211; an &#8220;antenna&#8221; &#8211; to have suitable emission intensities. Here we show that the mechanical bond can be used to connect the antenna to the emitter, providing dynamic features and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to the resulting assemblies. We outline a strategy to synthesize [2]rotaxanes capped with strong chelating groups, and establish that post&#8208;functionalization of the interlocked scaffold by lanthanide ion insertion is modular, high&#8208;yielding and straightforward. Photophysical studies revealed effective antenna&#8208;emitter energy transfer within the [2]rotaxane, and the sensitization mechanism as well as ring&#8208;thread dynamics were studied with spectroscopic and computational methods. The rotaxane was shown to have high selectivity toward Cu(II) ions, acting as an efficient turn&#8208;off sensor. This study validates the mechanical bond as a conjugation method between antennas and emitters, yielding otherwise hard&#8208;to&#8208;access and beneficial features to the resulting molecular systems.

         <title>A 19F&#8208;Labeled Probe for the Chiral Discrimination of Thiols and Thioethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel platinum&#8208;based 19F&#8208;labeled probe for the swift detection and chiral discrimination of sulfur&#8208;containing analytes. It generates distinctive 19F NMR signals corresponding to enantiomeric analytes. This method is applicable to both thiols and previously challenging thioethers, showcasing extensive potential applications in drug development, quality control, and screening of asymmetric reactions.








Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing compounds are pivotal in cellular processes such as redox balance and signal transduction. Traditionally, these compounds, especially thiols, are detected using fluorescence probes. However, these probes fall short in targeting thioethers due to their lower reactivity. Moreover, the chiral discrimination of thiols and thioethers typically relies on chromatographic methods, where separation&#8208;free, in situ strategies are highly desirable. To address this, we have developed a novel 19F&#8208;labeled chiral platinum probe capable of distinguishing both thiols and thioethers. This technique generates distinct 19F NMR signals that correspond to the stereoconfiguration of the analytes, enabling direct determination of their enantiocomposition. This method holds potential for integration into high&#8208;throughput workflows, boosting pharmaceutical and biological research by facilitating rapid, efficient chiral analysis of crucial compounds.

Sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8722;0.44&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl and an exceptional rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8208;1. Near&#8208;neutral redox flow batteries with 0.5&#160;M Fe complex show excellent stability over 300 cycles without capacity fading. It is attributed to hydrogen bonding, which reinforces Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promotes trimeric cluster formation, in contrast to that of the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted Fe complex.









Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective redox&#8208;active materials are essential for advancing redox flow batteries (RFBs). Iron, with its abundance and suitability as a redox couple, is a promising candidate; however, achieving stable and fast redox reactions in aqueous RFBs remains a challenge. This study presents an Fe&#8208;based negolyte stabilized by a hexadentate ligand, where Fe&#8211;ligand bonds are enhanced through intermolecular interactions. The sulfonate&#8208;substituted Fe complex exhibits a formal potential of &#8722;0.44&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl and an exceptionally high rate constant of 0.69&#160;cm s&#8722;1. Near&#8208;neutral RFBs incorporating 0.5&#160;M Fe complex show excellent cycling stability, with no discernible capacity fading over 300 cycles. This performance is attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonds that reinforce Fe&#8211;ligand coordination and promote the formation of stable trimeric clusters. Operando electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory reveal that &#960;&#8208;backdonation from Fe(II) to the imino&#8208;phenolate moiety further stabilizes the complex after reduction. In contrast, the hydroxyl&#8208;substituted complex exhibits inferior stability due to weaker hydrogen bonding and less pronounced &#960;&#8208;backdonation. These findings underscore the importance of ligand design and intermolecular interactions in developing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active materials for aqueous RFBs.

         <dc:description>
This study innovatively develops a multifunctional, multienzyme&#8208;active nanoplatform (FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx), aimed at overcoming the limitations of traditional cancer therapies and achieving precise, efficient, and long&#8208;lasting melanoma treatment. By integrating starvation therapy, CDT, mPTT, and immunotherapy, FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx generates a multidimensional synergistic effect while inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. With the enzyme activities of POD, OXD, CAT, and GOx, this system significantly improves the TME and further enhances its catalytic performance through a positive feedback mechanism, thereby increasing the overall therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Melanoma is characterized by rapid growth and high invasiveness, resulting in an exceptionally high malignancy and a significant propensity for metastasis. Current therapeutic modalities, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, exhibit limited efficacy due to severe side effects and immunosuppressive effects. Consequently, the development of precise and effective integrated therapeutic strategies is of paramount importance. Here, we report a multifunctional and multienzyme active nanosystem (FeCP@PDA&#8208;GOx) that synergistically integrates starvation therapy, chemodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and immunotherapy to achieve multidimensional therapeutic effects. This nanoplatform harnesses the enzymatic activities of glucose oxidase, peroxidase, oxidase, and catalase to enhance tumor microenvironment modulation and drug delivery efficiency, ultimately inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells. The system also establishes a positive feedback loop to further amplify its catalytic performance. Additionally, it effectively suppresses the expression of heat shock proteins in tumor cells, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT. Moreover, the system activates robust immune responses, suppressing lung metastasis and eliciting systemic antitumor effects to inhibit the growth of distal tumors. Experimental results demonstrate that this multifunctional nanoplatform exhibits exceptional therapeutic efficacy and safety in melanoma treatment, laying a solid foundation for the advancement of personalized medicine and intelligent therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Lithium Metal in Cubic Wulff Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study&#160;successfully achieved precise control over cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating the anodic interface and optimizing the deposition pressure, while demonstrating kinetically&#8208;driven morphology evolution and substrate&#8208;engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. This achievement reconciles the long&#8208;standing discrepancy between theoretical predictions of Wulff structures and experimental observations.








Abstract
Electrodeposition of lithium (Li) metal is crucial for highenergydensity rechargeable Li batteries. The electrodeposition morphology governs the reversibility of the deposition/dissolution reaction, thereby impacting battery performance and safety. Various morphologies, including hemispherical, granular, columnar, and whisker&#8208;like structures, have been realized by modulating the deposition thermodynamics and kinetics. However, the intrinsic Li deposition structure matching the body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) structure remains unexplored. Here, we first precisely&#160;controlled cubic Li deposits with (100) planes as the primary exposed surfaces via modulating anodic interface and optimizing deposition pressure, while demonstrating kinetically&#8208;driven morphology evolution and substrate&#8208;engineered epitaxial growth of cubic Li. These findings integrate the thermodynamic theory of crystal growth with interface engineering, completing the missing piece in the cubic Wulff construction of Li metal and providing a new paradigm for controlling the morphology of metal electrodes.

         <title>Co&#8208;sustained Release Strategy of Nonflammable Gel Polymer Electrolytes Enables Long&#8208;Life Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a capsule&#8208;like gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with a co&#8208;sustained release effect for sodium metal batteries. The designed GPE, featuring an insoluble polymer matrix and carbonate co&#8208;solvents, effectively mitigates phosphate&#8208;induced corrosion on sodium metal anode. More importantly, the formed NaF&#8208;rich SEI layers and the preferred orientation help to suppress sodium dendrite growth and improving sodium deposition/stripping performance.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are considered promising candidates for high energy&#8208;density batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and cost effectiveness. However, the intrinsic flammability of GPE poses challenges for their widespread application. Inspired by the concept of the capsules, a triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based GPE with co&#8208;sustained release effect has been designed. This structure features an insoluble ethoxylated trimethylopropane triacrylate (ETPTA) polymer matrix combined with carbonate co&#8208;solvents, effectively reducing the corrosion of TEP on sodium metal anodes while maintaining a continuous flame&#8208;retardant effect. In this distinctive structure, the abundant carbonyl group on ETPTA promotes the uniform migration of sodium ions, whereas the carbonate co&#8208;solvent facilitates the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, effectively suppressing the growth of sodium dendrite. Low content of TEP guide the preferential orientation of the (100) crystal plane of sodium anode, enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability. Na/GPE/Na cells can achieve stable cycling for over 1600 h, and the NVP/GPE/Na full cells exhibit 86.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the engineered GPE enables the operation of a 4.5&#160;V high&#8208;voltage cathode for 500 cycles. This strategy paves a new way for designing high&#8208;safety GPE tailored for high&#8208;performance SMBs.

         <title>Robust Ionic Gel Elastomers Derived from Molecularly Entangled Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate novel ionic gel elastomers by inducing the entanglements of polymer chains via molecularly entangled nodes. Utilizing the dissociation of entangled nodes under external stimuli, facilitating polymer chain sliding and resulting in energy dissipation and stress distribution, yields the more remarkable mechanical strength and toughness compared to the reported ionogels crosslinked via covalent and supramolecular strategies.








Abstract
In various types of intelligent devices, such as bionic robots, flexible polymeric elastomeric materials are essential for their operation, alongside the rigid skeleton. Conventional polymeric elastomeric materials, however, encounter a compromise between intelligence and mechanical robustness. Here, we construct ionic gel&#8208;based elastomers that harmoniously merge high intelligence with superior mechanical attributes by employing molecularly entangled nodes that facilitate polymer chain entanglement. The entangled nodes&#8217; dynamic interplay enables stress&#8208;induced dissociation, promoting polymer chain slippage that effectively dissipates energy and disperses stress. Consequently, these ionic gel&#8208;based elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of 33.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;MPa and a strain capacity of 4000&#160;&#177;&#160;280%, maintaining stable performance over 7000 cycles, while also possessing the ability to detect minor material defects, thereby advancing the versatility and reliability of intelligent devices.

Consequently, these ionic gel-based elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of 33.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;MPa and a strain capacity of 4000&#160;&#177;&#160;280%, maintaining stable performance over 7000 cycles, while also possessing the ability to detect minor material defects, thereby advancing the versatility and reliability of intelligent devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of Isomerically Diverse Ginsenosides Using Engineered Aerolysin Nanopore via Non&#8208;Translocation Blockade Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered aerolysin S278K with enhanced constriction, electro&#8208;osmotic flow (EOF), and interaction capability can trap fast&#8208;moving ginsenoside molecules and detain them for extended observation and characterization before release. This creates a non&#8208;translocation nanopore blockade sensing with high signal precision and resolution, enabling identification of 30 structurally complex and isomerically diverse ginsenosides.








Abstract
Typical nanopore sensing depends on slowed translocation through the pore to acquire effective blockade signals. However, this paradigm often suffers from low signal precision and poor resolution, making it challenging to resolve pools of analytes with diverse, similar structures. Here, we present a non&#8208;translocation blockade sensing based on an engineered aerolysin S278K that enables the identification of isomerically diverse ginsenosides&#8212;a class of glycoconjugates whose structural characterization has been a persistent challenge in glycoscience. By introducing the S278K mutation, the aerolysin acquires a highly positively charged interior and generates intense electro&#8208;osmotic flow and enhanced steric/enthalpic barriers, effectively trapping ginsenoside molecules in the K278&#8208;R220 region and preventing their further translocation. This distinct blockade sensing mode significantly improves the detection capability of aerolysin by prolonging residence time (e.g., 43&#8208;fold longer), enabling detailed molecular characterization. As a result, we demonstrate the unambiguous identification of 30 ginsenosides differing in glycosyl composition, isomerism, modification, and aglycone, as well as the quantitative analysis of complex ginsenosides in real samples by integrating deep learning. This work underscores the promise of non&#8208;translocation nanopore sensing for deciphering structurally complex and diverse small molecule analytes.

         <title>Probing the Heteroepitaxial Seeded Growth and Self&#8208;Sorting Processes of Segmented Co&#8208;Micelles with Chemically Distinct Crystalline Cores</title>

The investigation of heteroepitaxial crysta&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of copolymers with chemically distinct core&#8208;forming block, revealing micelle core lattices through self&#8208;assembly and lattice energy simulations, offering insights into energetic penalties and enabling screening of copolymer candidates for heteroepitaxial growth.








Abstract
The ability to produce uniform micellar nanoparticles with controlled dimension and spatially controlled functionality is a key challenge in nanoscience. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of block copolymers (BCP) has emerged as an effective approach to generate uniform size&#8208;tunable core&#8208;shell micellar nanoparticles; however, most core&#8208;shell micelles generated via CDSA consist of a continuous crystalline core from BCPs with the same core&#8208;forming block. Herein, we perform insightful studies of heteroepitaxial CDSA process from chemical distinct core&#8208;forming poly(ferrocenyldimethylgermane) (PFDMG) and poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PFDMS) based BCPs to produce segmented block comicelles. The heteroepitaxial growth process produced micelles with kinetically trapped crystalline cores that are thermodynamically less stable than the materials formed via spontaneous nucleation. This was rationalized by determining the previously unknown core lattice of PFDMG micelles, self&#8208;assembly experiments, and theoretical lattice energy calculations, providing an insight into the energetic penalty associated with heteroepitaxial growth. These methods for determining the theoretical core lattice energies in these BCP systems could provide a way to screen BCP candidates that can undergo heteroepitaxial growth. Furthermore, by using our newfound understanding of these micelle systems, we achieved the formation of micelles with crystalline cores that undergo self&#8208;sorting, driven by self&#8208;seeding from fragmented triblock comicellar structures.

         <title>Elucidating the Correlation Between the Redox Potential, Spin State, and Crystal Structure in a Series of Ferrous Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Fe(II) Hofmann&#8208;type clathrates with redox&#8208;active ligands reveals a bell&#8208;shaped relationship between redox potential and spin crossover temperature. This work uncovers how electronic ligand tuning modulates spin state, crystal symmetry, and electron transfer, rationalized through Marcus theory.








Abstract
Accurately predicting the spin crossover (SCO) temperature (T1/2) in spin crossover compounds remains a significant challenge due to their extreme sensitivity to minor variations in ligand and crystal structure. In this study, we uncover a critical link between the redox potential of ligands and SCO behavior within Hofmann&#8208;type clathrates {Fe(R&#8208;pbpy&#8314;)&#8322;[&#956;&#8322;&#8208;M(CN)&#8324;]&#8322;} (R&#160;=&#160;electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, M&#160;=&#160;Pd or Pt). Through precise tuning of the ligands' electronic properties, we establish a correlation between redox potential, space group, and SCO temperature, explained by an adaptation of Marcus theory of electron transfer. These findings not only provide a deeper understanding of the factors governing SCO behavior but also present a promising strategy for the rational design of SCO materials with tailored properties.

         <title>Mechanism of First Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer of Water Oxidation at the BiVO4${\rm BiVO}_4$&#8211;Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;energy surface for the first step of the oxygen evolution reaction at the BiOV4${\rm BiOV}_4$&#8211;water interface is obtained through machine&#8208;learning potentials at the hybrid&#8208;functional level of accuracy. This work reveals that the proton transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step, consistent with kinetic&#8208;isotope&#8208;effect experiments.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the BiVO4${\rm BiVO}_4$&#8211;water interface is considered to be the bottleneck of the overall water splitting at this aqueous interface. To provide insight into the mechanism of this reaction, the focus is set on the first proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). The free&#8208;energy surface of this first step is obtained by combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly probability&#8208;enhanced sampling and machine learning potentials at the hybrid functional level of accuracy. Our study reveals that proton transfer precedes electron transfer and determines the reaction barrier, consistent with kinetic&#8208;isotope&#8208;effect experiments. The calculated reaction barrier amounts to 0.66&#177;0.09$0.66\pm 0.09$ eV. The proton moves from the adsorbed water molecule to a surface O atom through a direct transfer mechanism. The hole hopping to the resulting hydroxide occurs via the mediation of a surface Bi atom. The presented framework can be generally applied to other PCET steps and other oxides, thus opening the door to a comprehensive investigation of the OER mechanism at oxide&#8211;water interfaces.

The method enables efficient synthesis of functionalized 2H&#8208;indazoles, facilitating the development of drug derivatives and G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;targeting fluorescent probes.

Abstract
Indazole frameworks are pivotal in medicinal chemistry and fluorescent conjugate design. Herein, we reported a photochemical strategy enabling efficient N&#8208;demethylation and aromatic cyclization of N&#8208;methyl amines via UV&#8208;induced nitroso intermediates, offering an environmentally benign route to structurally diverse 2H&#8208;indazole scaffolds. Diverging from conventional methods, this protocol demonstrates exceptional substrate compatibility with various alkyl/aryl amines, facilitating streamlined assembly of functionalized 2H&#8208;indazole modules. The methodology has been successfully applied to synthesize modified drugs and tumor&#8208;specific fluorescent probes targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes. Preliminary evaluations of physiological toxicity and cellular fluorescence imaging highlight their biomedical potential, establishing these strategies as potential tools for pharmacological development and bioimaging research.

         <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells via Chloramine Hydrochloride Molecular Bridges</title>

Here, 2&#8208;Chloroethylamine Hydrochloride (CEA), Bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)amine Hydrochloride (BCEA), and Tris(2&#8208;Chloroethyl)Amine Hydrochloride (TCEA) act as bifunctional molecular bridges to simultaneously passivate defects at both SnO2 and perovskite interfaces while controlling crystallization. TCEA accelerates &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 formation, promotes grain size, and minimizes grain boundary defects. This improves electron extraction efficiency, prolongs hot&#8208;carrier cooling, and achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.25%, with a PCE retention rate of 90% after 1000 h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) require synergistic passivation strategies to address defects at the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite interface, impacting both efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. This study introduces chloramine hydrochlorides (CAHs) &#8211; 2&#8208;Chloroethylamine Hydrochloride (CEA), Bis(2&#8208;chloroethyl)amine Hydrochloride (BCEA), and Tris(2&#8208;Chloroethyl)Amine Hydrochloride (TCEA) &#8211; as bifunctional molecular bridges to simultaneously passivate defects at both ETL (SnO2) and perovskite interfaces while controlling crystallization. Density functional theory calculations showed that TCEA forms strong Sn&#9472;Cl bonds, enhancing Sn&#8308;+ coordination. In situ characterization revealed that TCEA accelerated perovskite formation, suppressed PbI2, and promoted larger grains, thus minimizing grain boundary defects. This leads to an improved electron extraction efficiency, prolonged hot&#8208;carrier cooling, and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.25% (compared to 23.64% for controls), with negligible hysteresis and 90% PCE retention after 1000&#160;h under ambient conditions. This study establishes a universal molecular design strategy for dual&#8208;interface engineering in high&#8208;efficiency and stable PSCs.

         <title>Catalytic &#945;&#8208;Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange of Benzylic Alcohols by Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd SAC) enables &#945;&#8208;site&#8208;selective deuteration of benzylic alcohols via hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange (HDE), suppressing &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration. Mechanistic studies reveal dual pathways: direct C&#9472;H activation and a modified borrowing&#8208;hydrogen route avoiding keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. The Pd SAC combines stability, reusability, and broad substrate compatibility under mild conditions, resolving longstanding challenges in site&#8208;selective deuteration. This work advances single&#8208;atom catalysis for precision deuterated drug synthesis.








Abstract
Catalytic hydrogen&#8208;deuterium exchange (HDE) has emerged as a valuable tool for achieving site&#8208;selective deuteration and the precision labeling of bioactive molecules. Incorporation of deuterium at metabolically labile positions, enabled by such methods, can potentially improve drug efficacy through the kinetic isotope effect. However, achieving precise, site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium at specific molecular positions remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly efficient &#945;&#8208;site&#8208;selective HDE of benzylic alcohols via a palladium single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd SAC). By using the Pd SAC, exceptional activity and selectivity in HDE reactions were achieved, delivering up to 95% deuterium incorporation (D&#8208;inc.) at the &#945;&#8208;position while effectively suppressing undesired pathways (e.g., &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration). Mechanistic investigations reveal that the Pd SAC promotes site&#8208;selective HDE through two distinct surface pathways: (i) a previously unreported direct C&#9472;H bond activation and (ii) a modified borrowing hydrogen process in which high&#8208;pressure hydrogen inhibits the keto enol tautomerization, thereby largely circumvents &#945;,&#946;&#8208;multisite deuteration. The catalyst exhibits robust stability, reusability, and broad substrate compatibility, underscoring its potential for practical applications. This work marks a significant advance in heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalytic methodologies for site&#8208;selective deuteration, offering a complementary solution to longstanding challenges in catalytic organic synthesis.

         <title>Chain&#8211;Chain Synergistic Hydrogel Electrolytes Regulate Zinc Ions Desolvation for Stabilized Anodes and High Operating Voltage in Flexible Zinc Ions Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel electrolyte is composed of P(AM&#8208;SBMA) polymer chains and hydrophilic gelatin chains, which can effectively regulate the desolvation process of zinc ions, realize the rapid transference and uniform deposition of zinc ions, and stabilize the zinc anode interface. The assembled flexible zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can operate at high operating voltages.








Abstract
To maximize the energy density output, the complementary charge storage mechanism of aqueous zinc ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) is superior and advanced, but continuous water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc anodes remain challenging. Additionally, the optimization of the hydrogel electrolyte/electrode interface is necessary for the stability and kinetic reversibility of the flexible zinc&#8208;based energy storage device. Herein, the P(AM&#8208;SBMA) (copolymer of acrylamide AM and zwitterionic compound SBMA)/gelatin hydrogel electrolyte (PSG) with a special semi&#8208;interpenetrating network is designed based on the chain&#8211;chain synergistic regulation mechanism to regulate the desolvation of zinc ions and optimize the operating voltage of flexible ZIHCs and stabilize surface chemistry of zinc anode. The obtained PSG&#8208;5 hydrogel electrolyte widens the electrochemical stability windows (ESW) of the flexible ZIHC to 2.45&#160;V and achieves high Zn2+ transference number of 0.87 and highly reversible plating/stripping of the zinc anode. Furthermore, the corresponding flexible ZIHC exhibits a high operating voltage of 2.2&#160;V and provides a favorable energy density of 117&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 293&#160;W kg&#8722;1. This work provides useful insights for the development of efficient, flexible ZIHCs by preparing hydrogel electrolytes capable of stabilizing zinc anodes and widening ESW.

The Bi3+ with (18&#160;+&#160;2) electron configuration facilitates the NFPP cathode with high stability and impressive conductivity due to the high covalent characteristic of the Bi&#9472;O bond, reduced band gap, and well Na+ diffusion capability. The ionic polarization strategy make element doping solution more feasible in improve the rate capability and cycling stability at the same time.








Abstract
The Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode material faces the challenge of coordinating the improvement of high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;cycle stability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This study proposes an ionic polarization&#8208;driven defect engineering strategy, which regulates the electronic structure and Na+ transmission dynamics of NFPP through Bi3+ doping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show that Bi3+ with (18&#160;+&#160;2) electron configuration significantly enhances the crystal structure stability of NFPP by strengthening the covalency of Bi&#9472;O bonds. Meanwhile, the heterovalent Bi3+ doping optimizes the bandgap of the material (from 3.29 to 0.16&#160;eV) and promotes Na+ diffusion, while introducing lattice defects to provide additional sodium storage sites. The optimized 0.02Bi&#8208;NFPP cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance as the half&#8208;cell only takes 31.6&#160;min to charge to 80% at a rate of 1 C, and the capacity decay is only 0.000495&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 per cycle (86.9% capacity retention) over 20,000 cycles at 20 C. The full battery based on hard carbon anode maintains 95.5% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. This study reveals the synergistic mechanism between ion polarization effect and lattice defects, and provides a new strategy for designing SIBs cathode materials with both fast charging/discharging capabilities and ultra&#8208;long life.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Carbazolyl Cyanobenzene Conjugates: Enabling Biomolecule Functionalization via Photoredox and Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

We introduce two methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes onto peptides: a C&#8208;terminus decarboxylative functionalization and a Cys&#8208;selective SNAr reaction. Both conjugates exhibit excellent photoredox/energy&#8208;transfer properties, enabling their use for C&#8208;terminal alkynylation and Cys&#8208;selective thiol&#8208;ene reactions on peptides, as well as proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to integrin &#945;v&#946;3 by aryl azide excitation in living cells.








Abstract
Since their discovery in 2012, carbazolyl (iso)phthalonitrile (Cz(I)PN) derivatives have found significant applications as photocatalysts (PCs) in organic chemistry. Herein, we introduce two efficient methods for incorporating carbazolyl cyanobenzenes into various peptide sequences. The first method involves a photomediated decarboxylative functionalization of the C&#8208;terminus of peptides, leading to the formation of various carbazolyl benzonitrile (CzBN) derivatives. The second method exploits a cysteine&#8208;selective SNAr reaction on a fluorinated arene precursor, resulting in novel peptide&#8208;3CzIPN (triscarbazolyl&#8208;isophthalonitrile) conjugates. Both types of conjugates maintain delayed fluorescence properties, exhibit similar or wider redox potential, and possess higher excited state energy when compared to currently used cyanoarenes. We demonstrated the photocatalytic activity of these conjugates first through a photo&#8208;mediated peptide C&#8208;terminal decarboxylative alkynylation. Then, water&#8208;soluble peptide conjugates were used to catalyze a thiol&#8208;ene reaction on cysteine in aqueous media. Finally, we achieved protein labeling via aryl azide excitation both in vitro and at the cellular level using peptide&#8208;CzIPN conjugates. By incorporating a peptide ligand of the protein integrin &#945;v&#946;3, proximity&#8208;driven labeling next to this target was realized by aryl azide excitation in living cells, showing an excellent overlap with antibody&#8208;based imaging. These findings reveal the potential of cyanoarene&#8208;peptide conjugates for proximity&#8208;driven photochemistry in a complex biological context.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of 3D Metal Cluster&#8208;Based COFs With Record High&#8208;Connectivity for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline 3D [8&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;connected MCCOFs were synthesized by condensing Al8&#8208;8c with linear dialdehyde linkers for the first time. These AlCCOFs showed excellent photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion performances, with the maximum H2O2 yield of 16794.69&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 for AlCCOF&#8208;1.








Abstract
The assembly of metal clusters with organic building units by covalent bonds to form metal cluster&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (MCCOFs) material is a novel strategy in reticular synthesis. However, only 2, 3, and 6 connectivity of MCCOFs have been achieved in reported structures. Developing a higher connectivity remains a great challenge in the MCCOFs due to the difficulties in introducing multiple connecting nodes to the metal cluster. In this work, two 3D [8&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;connected MCCOFs were synthesized by condensing an 8&#8208;connectivity aluminum cluster&#8208;based building block (termed Al8&#8208;8c) with linear dialdehyde linkers. Furthermore, these AlCCOFs showed efficient photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion due to the suitable energy band structure, efficient photoelectron conversion capability and the AlCCOF&#8208;1 showed H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 16794.69&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 using water and benzyl alcohol reaction system. The in situ EPR, in situ FTIR, and DFT calculations were then performed to study the structure&#8208;function relationships on the two AlCCOFs for H2O2 photosynthesis. This work is the first report of high&#8208;connectivity MCCOFs bearing 8&#8208;connected cluster units, showing the great potential of using metal clusters to construct complicate reticular frameworks by covalent linkage.

         <title>Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction with Ultrahigh Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

An in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;modified Cu under acidic conditions is reported as a catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) for NO3&#8722; accumulation and electroreduction to NH3, with impressive half&#8208;cell energy efficiencies of 37.1% and 44.1% in 10&#160;mM and 0.5&#160;M NO3&#8722; solution (pH&#160;=&#160;1), respectively, higher than most reported values.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is an important feedstock for industry, an ideal energy carrier, and a perspective storage media for hydrogen. Recently, electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction under acidic conditions has received considerable attention but it suffers from limited efficiency especially under low NO3&#8722; concentration. Here, we report an in situ formed positively charged polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Cu under acidic conditions as a catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3. Such CEI can effectively accumulate NO3&#8722; anions via static interactions and accelerate *NO hydrogenation to *NOH by weakening *NO intermediate adsorption on Cu site, thereby facilitating NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Such CEI delivers an increased NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83.5% and an impressive half&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 37.1% in 10&#160;mM NO3&#8722; solution (pH&#160;=&#160;1). The NH3 FE and EE can further increase to 90.2% and 44.1% in 0.5&#160;M NO3&#8722;, respectively. The high EE of CEI surpasses previously reported catalyst performances for NO3&#8722; reduction. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel NO3&#8722;&#8208;furfural battery, showcasing a self&#8208;power electrocatalytic system capable of simultaneously treating NO3&#8722; pollutants, generating value&#8208;added NH3 and upgrading biomass. This work offers valuable insights into the construction of a CEI to enhance the efficiency of NH3 synthesis.

         <title>Direct Integration of Functionalized Bridges by One&#8208;Step Superacid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction to Fabricate Porous Polymers for CO2 Capture and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;step polymerization of unfunctionalized polyaromatic monomers and glyoxylic acid under superacid&#8208;catalysis conditions promotes the simultaneous generation of highly porous 3D architectures and the controlled decoration of pore surfaces with aliphatic carboxylic acids. These ultra&#8208;microporous frameworks and their ester and polyionic derivatives, based on Li+ and Na+ carboxylate, demonstrate exceptional affinity for CO2 and CO2/N2 separation capabilities. 








Abstract
A novel class of ultra&#8208;microporous functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs) was developed starting from glyoxylic acid as a cross&#8208;linker and triflic acid as a catalyst on polyaromatic monomers, generating in situ methine bridges with carboxylic acids. This one&#8208;pot synthetic method generated functionalized POPs with high connectivity per each aromatic group and a high density of aliphatic carboxylic acids decorating the pore walls. Remarkably, the functional groups were transformed into esters, Na&#8208; and Li&#8208;carboxylates by post&#8208;synthetic modification with high yields, generating polyionic porous polymers. These porous polymers displayed excellent CO2 adsorption at 298&#160;K and isosteric heat of adsorption with values as high as 50&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the Na&#8208;containing POP endowed with numerous ionic charges, as estimated by direct measurements with microcalorimetry coupled to CO2 adsorption isotherms. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on self&#8208;supporting monolithic composites demonstrated high selectivity for CO2 adsorption over N2 up to 500 for diluted streams and 340 under relevant conditions for carbon capture from flue gases (0.15 CO2 partial pressure).

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia Using Bimetallic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tandem Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating covalent organic frameworks electrocatalyst with bimetallic active sites and promoting cascade electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia through the copper&#8208;cobalt tandem mechanism. The Cu sites serve as the activation centers for adsorption and the initial 2e&#8722; process. The &#8208;N&#8208;Co&#8208;O&#8208; interface promotes water adsorption and dissociation, facilitates the formation of *H&#8208;rich interface, and boosts the subsequent 6e&#8722; process, thus accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to simultaneously realize pollutant removal and ammonia generation. However, this process involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons along with multiple by&#8208;products, resulting in a significant challenge for achieving high ammonia yield and selectivity. Herein, we introduced bimetallic covalent organic frameworks catalysts with Cu and Co active sites to achieve a two&#8208;step tandem reaction, avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling efficient NO3RR. For the initial two&#8208;electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate, promoting their conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen and stabilize the subsequent six&#8208;electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency (NH3 yield rate&#160;=&#160;20.8 mg&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2, FE&#160;=&#160;92.16% in 0.3&#160;M nitrate). Such coordinated two&#8208;step process advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR through optimizing a cascade catalytic reaction, thereby establishing an innovative path for the engineering of NO3RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Bypassing In Situ CO Poisoning in Furfural Conversion: Electron&#8208;Deficient Pd Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Enable One&#8208;Step Selective Synthesis of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;deficient Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts unlock a tandem decarbonylation&#8208;hydrogenation pathway for the one&#8208;step selective conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to tetrahydrofuran, overcoming the limitations of conventional Pd catalysts that yield furan as the main product due to in situ CO poisoning.








Abstract
The one&#8208;step conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfural (FUR) to tetrahydrofuran (THF) via combining decarbonylation and hydrogenation offers a sustainable alternative to the industrial Reppe process, while the selectivity control remains a significant challenge. Herein, we identify carbon monoxide (CO), in situ generated during FUR decarbonylation, as a major hindrance, significantly inhibiting subsequent furan hydrogenation. To overcome this limitation, a zeolite&#8208;encapsulated Pt1Pd single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst, namely Pt10Pd90@S&#8208;1, is designed, which effectively mitigates CO poisoning and enables efficient FUR conversion to THF, achieving 100% FUR conversion and &gt;93% THF selectivity with good long&#8208;term stability (&#8764;100&#160;h)&#8212;among the highest values reported to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that electron&#8208;deficient Pd species adjacent to single Pt atoms in Pt10Pd90@S&#8208;1 significantly enhance H2 activation and furan adsorption, enabling efficient hydrogenation at both the C&#945; and C&#946; positions of furan despite CO poisoning. Furthermore, the one&#8208;step process is economically viable with a minimum selling price (MSP) of USD 1701 per tonne of THF, and a life cycle assessment shows a CO2 equivalent emission of 1.29 tonnes per tonne of THF&#8212;less than 25% of that of the traditional Reppe process. This work represents a transformative advancement in sustainable THF production, with the potential to revolutionize industrial THF production.

         <title>Mechanochemistry&#8208;Driven Borrowing Hydrogen Processes for Ru&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation: A Pathway to Enhanced Sustainability and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical borrowing hydrogen (BH) strategy for the rapid and efficient N&#8208;alkylation of amines and heterocycles. By removing harsh conditions and toxic reagents while employing a simple Ru catalyst, this approach redefines BH as a cleaner, more versatile, and sustainable platform for synthetic chemistry.








Abstract
This study presents the first mechanochemical borrowing hydrogenation (BH) strategy, offering a direct and efficient route to N&#8208;alkylated amines and heterocycles. This solvent&#8208;free approach overcomes many challenges associated with conventional solution&#8208;based syntheses, such as toxic reagents, inert atmospheres, high temperatures, lengthy reaction times, excessive catalyst loadings, and the use of solvents. By applying this method under mechanochemical conditions and employing a readily available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst, we achieved high conversions of a diverse set of primary amines and alcohols into N&#8208;alkylated amines. Furthermore, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies and Hammett analyses provided key insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Ultimately, this protocol expands synthetic possibilities by facilitating the preparation of heterocycles.

Synergizing the quantum size effect for enhanced In2O3 reducibility with strong In&#8211;O&#8211;Zr interfacial confine for high stability enables the creation of enriched large&#8208;size VO clusters (e.g., trimers, tetramers, and larger) on ZrO2&#8208;supported monolayer In2O3&#8208;x nano&#8208;islands without overreduction to metallic indium. This boosts a higher intrinsic activity for methanol production than that of bulk In2O3 with single VO sites in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (VO) play a vital role in catalytic reactions. Tuning the VO structures beyond its density is of great significance for optimizing catalytic performance, but remains challenging due to uncontrolled reduction and its poor stability under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the integration of quantum size effect for enhanced In2O3 reducibility with strong In&#8211;O&#8211;Zr interfacial confinement for high stability enables the creation of stable large&#8208;size VO clusters (e.g., trimers, tetramers, and larger) on ZrO2&#8208;supported monolayer In2O3&#8208;x nano&#8208;islands with high density without overreduction to metallic indium. In the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, the ZrO2&#8208;supported monolayer In2O3&#8208;x catalyst with VO clusters exhibits a considerably higher intrinsic activity for methanol production than that of bulk In2O3 with single VO sites. Further addition of Pd onto these monolayer In2O3&#8208;x with enriched VO clusters allows achieving an unprecedentedly high methanol space&#8208;time yield of 46.6 mmolMeOH&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 270&#160;&#176;C along with long&#8208;term stability for at least 200&#160;h, surpassing all In2O3&#8208;based catalysts reported to date.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed COF/Zeolite Composites for Augmented Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of COF/zeolite composite photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide were fabricated via 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed architectures feature honeycomb&#8208;like channels, which facilitate the in&#8208;situ growth and high crystallinity of COFs. Leveraging the superior hydrophilicity and O2 affinity of zeolite, the homogeneous composite boosts efficiency by 52% over pristine COF.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), characterized by high porosity and fine&#8208;tuned structures, are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, their hydrophobic nature restricts the mass transfer in water, presenting challenges in achieving high performance. Coupling COFs with hydrophilic zeolites can potentially advance H2O2 production, yet integrating these two distinct types of porous materials is challenging. Herein, we first applied 3D printing technology to fabricate COF/zeolite composite catalysts, which enabled superior photosynthesis of H2O2. By precisely optimizing binders and prepolymerization conditions, homogeneous inks composed of zeolite nanocrystals and initial polymeric precursors were prepared with appropriate rheology for 3D printing. The resultant monolith with honeycomb&#8208;like open&#8208;channels was favorable for the in&#8208;situ growth and crystallization of COF by facilitating the efficient molecular transfer of condensing agents and large covalent segments during solvothermal post&#8208;treatment. Mechanistic studies indicated that introducing zeolites enhanced the hydrophilicity and O2 affinity within the composite, favoring the oxygen reduction reaction pathway. Consequently, the photosynthesis of H2O2 by the COF/zeolite composite was markedly improved by 52% compared to the bare COFs. This work provides a facile way to integrate COFs and zeolites by 3D printing, which may open diverse applications of such composites by taking advantage of both merits.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Oxygen Coordination Steering *NO Hydrogenation in Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogenation pathway of the *NO intermediate is a critical step determining the selectivity of hydroxylamine, yet current understanding remains limited. Studies reveal that the hydrogenation sites of the *NO intermediate are governed by the cobalt coordination environment. Specifically, *NO adsorbs in a bridged configuration on 4&#8208;coordinate cobalt sites, which facilitates nitrogen&#8208;site hydrogenation, whereas it adsorbs in an on&#8208;top manner on 6&#8208;coordinate cobalt sites, promoting oxygen&#8208;site hydrogenation.








Abstract
Understanding the hydrogenation behavior of *NO during electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is essential for designing catalysts with high selectivity toward ammonia (NH3) and valuable intermediates like hydroxylamine. Spinel cobalt oxides (Co3O4) are promising NO3RR electrocatalysts, yet the exact *NO hydrogenation mechanism remains unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical calculations and systematic experiments to reveal that the hydrogenation pathway is dictated by the coordination environment, which can be tuned via crystal facet engineering. Co3O4 nanoparticles enriched with (111) facets (o&#8208;Co3O4) and (100) facets (c&#8208;Co3O4) were synthesized to expose 4&#8208; and 6&#8208;coordinated Co sites, respectively. Theoretical results show that o&#8208;Co3O4 favors nitrogen&#8208;site hydrogenation (&#8727;NO&#8594;&#8727;NHO$ ^*\text{NO}\to ^*\text{NHO} $), while c&#8208;Co3O4 promotes oxygen&#8208;site hydrogenation (&#8727;NO&#8594;&#8727;NHO$ ^*\text{NO}\to ^*\text{NHO} $), leading to distinct rate&#8208;determining steps. This selectivity is experimentally supported by in situ spectroscopy, which detects the *NH2OH intermediate exclusively on o&#8208;Co3O4. Consequently, o&#8208;Co3O4 achieves superior NO3RR performance, with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.4% and an NH3 yield rate of 12.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at&#160;&#8722;0.4&#160;V. This work uncovers the coordination&#8208;governed mechanism of *NO hydrogenation and establishes facet engineering as an effective strategy for directing reaction pathways in NO3RR.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Alkynyl&#8208;Functionalized Silver&#8211;Polyoxotungstate Nanocluster with Sandwiched Three&#8208;Layer {Ag13}13+ Cluster Architecture and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>

The silver&#8211;POM hybrid nanocluster [(n&#8208;Bu)&#8324;N]&#8327;[(C&#8326;H&#8329;)&#8326;(PW&#8321;&#8321;O&#8323;&#8329;)&#8322;Ag&#8321;&#8323;] features a unique three&#8208;layered {Ag&#8321;&#8323;}&#185;3&#8314; core. Synergistic redox activity between the POM and silver enhances ROS generation via a Fenton&#8208;like mechanism, leading to strong antitumor effects.








Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise, structurally well&#8208;defined polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;stabilized silver clusters with accessible silver surfaces remains a significant challenge. Here, we report an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized silver&#8211;POM hybrid nanocluster, [(n&#8208;Bu)4&#160;N]7[(C6H9)6(PW11O39)2Ag13] ((PW11)2&#8208;Ag13), which comprises of a distinctive homovalent three&#8208;layer {Ag13}13+ cluster. This architecture yields a lower HOMO&#160;&#8722;&#160;LUMO energy gap of 1.93&#160;eV, compared to the precursor [PW11O39]7&#8722; (2.74&#160;eV). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that the lacunary [PW11O39]7&#8722; and alkynyl units direct the formation of the atomically precise {Ag13}13+ cluster, preventing undesirable silver aggregation while maintaining exposed silver surfaces that are crucial for catalytic activity. The synergistic redox capabilities of the POM and silver components enhance the redox reactivity of (PW11)2&#8208;Ag13, promoting efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via a Fenton&#8208;like mechanism. Additionally, biological evaluations further reveal that (PW11)2&#8208;Ag13 exhibits significantly superior antitumor activity than [PW11O39]7&#8722;, primarily through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis facilitated by the active silver cluster sites. These findings highlight the potential of silver cluster&#8208;POM hybrids as promising candidates for anticancer therapeutic applications.

     alt="An Atomically Precise Alkynyl-Functionalized Silver&#8211;Polyoxotungstate Nanocluster with Sandwiched Three-Layer {Ag13}13+ Cluster Architecture and Enhanced Antitumor Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The silver&#8211;POM hybrid nanocluster [(n-Bu)&#8324;N]&#8327;[(C&#8326;H&#8329;)&#8326;(PW&#8321;&#8321;O&#8323;&#8329;)&#8322;Ag&#8321;&#8323;] features a unique three-layered {Ag&#8321;&#8323;}&#185;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; core. Synergistic redox activity between the POM and silver enhances ROS generation via a Fenton-like mechanism, leading to strong antitumor effects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of atomically precise, structurally well-defined polyoxometalate (POM)-stabilized silver clusters with accessible silver surfaces remains a significant challenge. Here, we report an alkynyl-functionalized silver&#8211;POM hybrid nanocluster, [(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Bu)&lt;sub&gt;4&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;[(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;(PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), which comprises of a distinctive homovalent three-layer {Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;13+&lt;/sup&gt; cluster. This architecture yields a lower HOMO&#160;&#8722;&#160;LUMO energy gap of 1.93&#160;eV, compared to the precursor [PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;7&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (2.74&#160;eV). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that the lacunary [PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;7&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and alkynyl units direct the formation of the atomically precise {Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;13+&lt;/sup&gt; cluster, preventing undesirable silver aggregation while maintaining exposed silver surfaces that are crucial for catalytic activity. The synergistic redox capabilities of the POM and silver components enhance the redox reactivity of &lt;b&gt;(PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, promoting efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via a Fenton-like mechanism. Additionally, biological evaluations further reveal that &lt;b&gt;(PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits significantly superior antitumor activity than [PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;7&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, primarily through ROS-induced apoptosis facilitated by the active silver cluster sites. These findings highlight the potential of silver cluster-POM hybrids as promising candidates for anticancer therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Tuned Solid&#8208;Liquid Transition of Azo&#8208;Grafted Poly(thioctic acid) with Ultrahigh Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;grafted poly(thioctic acid) could undergo a reversible solid&#8208;liquid transition under green light irradiation. The light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency (LHCE) of Azo&#8208;PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90&#160;&#176;C within 30&#160;s of green light irradiation. Thus, several cutting&#8208;edge applications of Azo&#8208;PTA were explored, including photo&#8208;switchable adhesion, self&#8208;healing coating, and smart window.








Abstract
Functional materials with photo&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition have garnered significant attention and found extensive applications across cutting&#8208;edge domains. However, previous photo&#8208;liquefiable behaviors of azopolymers are usually induced through UV light, which may damage the performances of the materials and is also harmful to human health. Here, a novel azopolymer (Azo&#8208;PTA) was fabricated via the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of thioctic acid (TA) and azobenzene&#8208;modified thioctic acid (Azo&#8208;TA). Interestingly, Azo&#8208;PTA could undergo a reversible solid&#8208;liquid transition under green light irradiation. The phase transition process of Azo&#8208;PTA was investigated systematically through various experimental and measurement methods. The results demonstrated that the solid&#8208;liquid transition of Azo&#8208;PTA was ascribed to the photothermal effect rather than the photochemical process. The light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency of Azo&#8208;PTA was as high as 84.9%, and the temperature could increase to above 90&#160;&#176;C within 30&#160;s of green light irradiation. Consequently, azopolymers with green light&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition behaviors were successfully achieved. Moreover, several cutting&#8208;edge applications of Azo&#8208;PTA were explored, including photo&#8208;switchable adhesion, self&#8208;healing coating, and smart window. Our finding thus opens up a new platform for the fabrication of azopolymers with visible light&#8208;regulated solid&#8208;liquid transition.

         <title>Electrochemical Allene C&#9472;H Functionalization via Carbanion Sampling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy chemistry is pushing the boundaries of synthetic chemistry. Traditionally, the selectivity patterns of C&#9472;H functionalization have been governed by the inherent C&#9472;H bond acidity and strength. Herein, we leverage chromium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen evolution to overcome the intrinsic constraints via carbanion sampling. This strategy enables the unprecedented construction of thermodynamically unfavored products, including alkylated allenes and alkynes. 








Abstract
Functionalization of C&#9472;H bonds represents a direct and practical avenue to upgrade simple organic molecules to value&#8208;added products, whereas the reaction selectivity is largely governed by the acidity and bond dissociation energy (BDE) of C&#9472;H bonds. Developing a novel strategy to break these constraints is highly desirable, as it would open a new horizon for conventionally challenging molecules. Herein, we disclosed a carbanion sampling strategy that enables unconventional selectivity in the allene C(sp2)&#9472;H functionalization harnessing chromium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen evolution. The electrochemical protocol provides in situ access to diverse allene carbanions and facilitates a dynamic carbanion sampling process to give thermodynamically unfavored products. 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted allenes were precisely functionalized at the less acidic and stronger C(sp2)&#9472;H site to yield abnormal site&#8208;selective allene products, while the 1,1&#8208;substituted allenes proceeded isomerization to deliver functionalized alkynes. All of the products presented in this work are unprecedented and exhibit remarkable versatility in late&#8208;stage derivatization. The superiority of the carbanion sampling strategy was demonstrated in the convergent synthesis of functionalized allenes from alkyne or mixed substrates. More importantly, we conducted a series of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control experiments to rationalize the unconventional selectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Z&#8208;Substituted Enamides, Enol Ethers, and Vinyl Sulfides Using Iodine (III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequential functionalization of novel BCP&#8208;substituted ethynylbenziodoxolone (EBX) reagents into heteroatom&#8208; and BCP&#8208;substituted alkenes is described. The addition of N, O, and S nucleophiles on the EBXs was stereoselective and generated heteroatomic Z&#8208;vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) reagents. The hypervalent iodine bond reacted under mild conditions to give access to Z&#8208;substituted enamides, enol ethers, and vinyl sulfides.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are well&#8208;studied bioisosteres for para&#8208;substituted benzene rings, and numerous methods for synthesizing 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized BCPs have been developed. However, synthetic approaches to access vinyl BCP motifs remain limited, with only few reports on the synthesis of BCP&#8208;olefins bearing heteroatom substituents. Herein, we present the synthesis of BCP&#8208;substituted enamides, enol ethers, and vinyl sulfides through the sequential functionalization of ethynylbenziodoxolone (EBX) reagents containing a BCP scaffold. Stereoselective addition of a nucleophile generates heteroatomic Z&#8208;vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) reagents. The hypervalent iodine substituent of the VBX reagents serves then as a versatile platform for further arylation, vinylation, and trifluoromethylation. This method provides a modular synthesis of previously inaccessible heteroatom&#8208;substituted vinyl BCPs.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Benzaldoxime Synthesis by Glutathione&#8208;Modified CdS Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, the integration of quantum dots and glutathione (GSH) relays realizes photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis for the first time. GSH not only expedites hole transfer to enable selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde but also favors proton transfer to deliver NH2OH. The synergic orchestration of distinct chemical processes within a single reaction system paves way to valuable nitrogenous chemicals.








Abstract
Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, we report herein the first photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis from NOx&#8722; (x&#160;=&#160;2,&#160;3) and benzyl alcohol. Different from introducing co&#8208;catalysts, the integration of glutathione (GSH) relay with CdS quantum dots (QDs) can effectively mediate hole transfer and facilitate selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. At the same time, GSH assists continuous proton transfer to promote selective NOx&#8722; reduction and form NH2OH in situ. As a result, the synergic C&#8211;N coupling delivers a series of benzyl oximes from NOx&#8722; and benzyl alcohols with excellent yield and selectivity. Benzaldoxime synthesis proceeds at a rate of 18.7&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and TON of 52,875, accomplishing 90.6% benzyl alcohol conversion and 72.3% benzaldoxime yield, which is comparable to the best records for electrocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis. The excellent long&#8208;term recyclability and scaled reaction to produce 0.58&#160;g benzaldoxime with a yield of 41% demonstrate efficient, atom&#8208;economic, and step&#8208;economic photocatalytic oxime synthesis via selective C&#8211;N coupling from abundant resources.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, the integration of quantum dots and glutathione (GSH) relays realizes photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis for the first time. GSH not only expedites hole transfer to enable selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde but also favors proton transfer to deliver NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. The synergic orchestration of distinct chemical processes within a single reaction system paves way to valuable nitrogenous chemicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the secondary coordination sphere of nitrite reductase, we report herein the first photocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis from NO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;2,&#160;3) and benzyl alcohol. Different from introducing co-catalysts, the integration of glutathione (GSH) relay with CdS quantum dots (QDs) can effectively mediate hole transfer and facilitate selective benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde. At the same time, GSH assists continuous proton transfer to promote selective NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction and form NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH in situ. As a result, the synergic C&#8211;N coupling delivers a series of benzyl oximes from NO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and benzyl alcohols with excellent yield and selectivity. Benzaldoxime synthesis proceeds at a rate of 18.7&#160;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and TON of 52,875, accomplishing 90.6% benzyl alcohol conversion and 72.3% benzaldoxime yield, which is comparable to the best records for electrocatalytic benzaldoxime synthesis.

         <title>Highly Efficient Singlet Oxygen Production in a Cascade Photoelectrocatalytic System for Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction between the photoanodic and cathodic reactions to boost the singlet oxygen production without addition of chemical precursors, which circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable process and fundamentally changes the traditional singlet oxygen generation pathway, thereby promising a green, low&#8208;consumption, and sustainable approach to water decontamination. 








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) demonstrates great potential for selective wastewater detoxification, which raises the appeal to achieve a controllable, mild, and efficient generation of this reactive species for water decontamination. Herein, we present a novel cascade photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system operated via the interaction between the photoanodic and cathodic reactions without the addition of chemical precursors, realizing highly efficient &#185;O&#8322; production (79.7&#160;&#181;mol L&#8722;1 min&#8722;1) and low energy consumption (0.052&#160;kWh m&#8722;3 &#8208;log) for antibiotic degradation. The enhanced 1O2 production is proven to benefit from the synergistic effect of multiple activation pathways under PEC excitation. With the combined action of both the built&#8208;in electric field and external electric field, the holes in the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photoanode are maximally retained, and electrons are transferred to cathode to undergo the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the production of the crucial reactive oxygen species as intermediates. The occurrence of a cascade reaction is initiated by electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; ORR on the cathode and terminated by superoxide species oxidation by holes on the photoanode. The hole&#8208;involved 1O2 generation pathway circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable process of traditional 1O2 generation. This work highlights a new PEC route for highly efficient 1O2 generation, making it a potential application in more effective environmental remediation.

         <title>The Doping Effects on the NIR Emission Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters and the Application in Efficient NIR&#8208;OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

Doping effects have been clearly established based on alloy nanoclusters Au22&#8208;xCux (tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;6). The more Cu doped, the higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Au19Cu3 and Au17.1Cu4.9 show remarkable solution NIR emission under ambient conditions with the PLQYs at &#8764;710&#160;nm being &#8764;55% and &#8764;72%, respectively. A remarkable external quantum efficiency of &#8764;15.43% is achieved from a NIR&#8208;OLED with Au16Cu6 as the emitting layer, showing the prospect of metal NCs for potential applications in NIR&#8208;OLED.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive materials. A series of highly red/NIR luminescent Au&#8211;Cu nanoclusters have been synthesized, Au22&#8208;xCux (tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;6) (Au22&#8208;xCux). Compared with the parental cluster Au22(tBuC6H4C&#8801;C)18 (Au22), doping effects have been clearly established: the more the amount of doping Cu, the higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Remarkable solutions for NIR emission under ambient conditions are found with Au19Cu3 and Au17.1Cu4.9, and the PLQYs at &#8764;710&#160;nm are &#8764;55% and &#8764;72%, respectively. The study on excited state dynamics of these clusters reveals that the more copper atoms doped, the slower nonradiative decay and the faster intersystem crossing rate, the higher PLQY. Surprisingly, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;15.43% is achieved from a NIR&#8208;OLED with Au16Cu6 as the emitting layer, showing the prospect of metal NCs in potential applications for NIR&#8208;OLED.

         <title>Thermally Activated Sensitized Fluorescence Enables Efficient Carbon Quantum Dot&#8208;Based Electroluminescent LEDs with Current Efficiency of 31&#160;cd A&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
Bright and efficient electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes based on solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been demonstrated, achieving a record&#8208;high current efficiency of 31&#160;cd A&#8722;1. This exceptional performance is attributed to the implementation of a thermally activated sensitized fluorescence mechanism, which significantly enhances exciton utilization, combined with the high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 80% for CQDs doped in the host.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are gaining increasing attention as eco&#8208;friendly alternatives to conventional heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting. However, the performance of CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (CQD&#8208;LEDs) remains significantly lower than their heavy&#8208;metal counterparts, primarily due to the substantial energy loss from triplet excitons during electrical excitation and the reduced quantum yield (QY) in solid films. Here, we present the demonstration of bright and efficient electroluminescent LEDs based on a thermally activated sensitized fluorescence (TSF) mechanism, employing a new class of solid&#8208;state emissive (SSE) CQDs that exhibit efficient orange emission in the solid state and bright green emission when doped into host materials, with a QY exceeding 80%. By employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials as both hosts and sensitizers, along with highly efficient CQDs as dopants, we significantly enhance exciton utilization through effective F&#246;rster energy transfer from sensitizers to CQDs. This strategy results in bright, efficient green CQD&#8208;LEDs, achieving a maximum luminance of approximately 16,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a record&#8208;high current efficiency of 31&#160;cd A&#8722;1. This work provides a straightforward and universal strategy for creating efficient SSE CQD&#8208;LEDs using the TSF strategy.

         <title>Accelerated Exciton Dissociation and Charge Transfer via Third&#8208;Motif Engineered Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic Circulation&#8208;flow Synthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for improved electronic properties in linear conjugated polymers was presented through the modulation of an engineered third component. Optimization of the third component significantly lowers exciton binding energy, enlarges molecular dipole moment, lowers the *OOH binding energy and creates multidirectional electron transport channels, collectively boosting the solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Achieving effective exciton dissociation and charge transport in linear polymer photocatalysts for H2O2 photosynthesis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we fabricated three&#8208;motif cross&#8208;linked polymers by rationally introducing a third functional component into a two&#8208;motif linear polymer, which were employed for circulation&#8208;flow photocatalytic H2O2 production. By strategically modulating the third component, we precisely tuned the electronic structure, significantly lowering exciton binding energy and enlarging the molecular dipole moment. Compared to the original linear configuration, the resulting cross&#8208;linked structure creates multidirectional electron transport channels. Combined experimental and calculation investigations demonstrate that these synergistic effects collectively promote exciton dissociation and intramolecular electron transfer. PAQ&#8208;TABPB photocatalyst with optimized third&#8208;motif accelerates oxygen&#8208;to&#8208;superoxide radical transformation by lowering the *OOH binding energy, thereby facilitating the two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway, attaining an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3351&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Notably, we constructed a circulation&#8208;flow reactor for the photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Benefiting from improved gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer and efficient light irradiation, this high&#8208;speed flow system achieved a 5.2&#8208;fold increase in H2O2 production compared to a conventional batch reactor under the light intensity of 27&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, reaching an accumulated yield of 3125&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 with stable recyclability. This work highlights the potential of multi&#8208;component polymeric photocatalysts and circulation&#8208;flow reactors for H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>In Situ/Operando Probing of Dynamic Phase Structures of Alumina&#8208;Supported Ultrasmall Copper&#8208;Gold Alloy Nanoparticles Under Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported ultrasmall copper&#8208;gold alloy nanoparticles are active heterogenous catalysts. In situ TEM tracking under oxygen at different temperatures reveals atomic&#8208;scale dynamic phase structures, whereas combined operando synchrotron HE&#8208;XRD and DRIFTS characterizations uncover ensemble&#8208;averaged ordering/disordering phase structures and oscillatory surface adsorbates, showing implications for designing highly stable ultrasmall alloy catalysts.








Abstract
The ability to control phase structures and surface sites of ultrasmall alloy nanoparticles under reaction conditions is essential for preparing catalysts by design. This is, however, challenging due to limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;scale phases and their correlation with the ensemble&#8208;averaged structures and activities of catalysts during catalytic reactions. We reveal here a dynamic structural stability of alumina&#8208;supported ultrasmall and equiatomic copper&#8208;gold alloy nanoparticles under reaction conditions as a model system in the in situ/operando study. In situ atomic&#8208;scale morphological tracking under oxygen reveals temperature&#8208;dependent dynamic crystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structures, showing dynamic stability over an elevated temperature range. This atomic&#8208;scale dynamic phase stability coincides with a &#8220;conversion plateau&#8221; observed for carbon monoxide oxidation on the catalyst. It is substantiated by the stable lattice ordering/disordering structures and surface sites with oscillatory characteristics shown by operando ensemble&#8208;average structural tracking of the catalyst during the oxidation reaction. The understanding of the atomic&#8208;scale dynamic phase structures in correlation with the ensemble&#8208;average dynamic ordering/disordering phase structures and surface sites provides fresh insights into the unique synergy of the supported alloy nanoparticles. This understanding has implications for the design and structural tuning of active and stable ultrasmall alloy catalysts under elevated temperatures.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Assisted Nonradiative Processes to Couple Photothermy and Photosensitization for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;assisted multiple nonradiative (NR) processes have been achieved to couple 85.05% photothermal conversion and type&#8208;I photosensitization with superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation based on a well&#8208;designed near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing diradical&#8208;featured croconium (CR) dendrimer, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe, through &#8220;N&#8208;CR&#8221; molecular engineering strategy, bringing about a water evaporation efficiency of 92.6% and antibacterial efficacy under one sunlight for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation.








Abstract
Nonradiative (NR) processes are pivotal in engineering materials with tailored properties for energy utilization. However, their intrinsic rapidity and competitiveness pose huge challenges in on&#8208;demand manipulation. Herein, radical&#8208;assisted multiple NR processes were achieved to couple photothermy and photosensitization based on a unique near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing diradical&#8208;featured croconium (CR) dendrimer, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe. This dendrimer is well&#8208;designed by the direct covalent linkage between the flexible dendritic diphenylamine (DPA) and rigid diradical&#8208;featured CR units. The intrinsic diradical characteristics promote internal conversions in company with intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, and the hyperfine coupling effect between the dimeric radical&#8208;ion pair excitons and adjacent magnetic nuclei assists intersystem crossing. Besides, the abundant intramolecular motions from the twisted and flexible dendritic diphenylamine groups facilitate vibrational relaxation and electron transfer. These processes endow CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;OMe with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 85.05% and superoxide anion generation capability under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. Thus, a water evaporation efficiency of 92.6% and antibacterial efficacy under one sunlight are obtained, comprehensively superior to previously reported organic small&#8208;molecule photothermal materials for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of radicals in NR process manipulation, significantly boosting the development of organic functional materials with on&#8208;demand excited&#8208;state energy conversions.

         <title>Chemical Bond Covalency in Superionic Halide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high conductivity in halide solid&#8208;state electrolytes requires understanding key factors for ionic diffusion. This study provides direct evidence that metal&#8208;halide covalent bonding controls superionic transitions and enhances Li+ mobility. Tailoring covalency through composition, demonstrated via in situ studies and simulations on bromide&#8208;based electrolytes, offers a novel bond&#8208;centric design strategy for high&#8208;performance SSEs.








Abstract
Halide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising superionic conductors with high oxidative stability and ionic conductivity, making them attractive for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, most studies have focused on ion&#8208;stacking structures, overlooking the role of bond characteristics in ionic transport. Here, we investigate bond dynamics and the superionic transition (SIT) in bromide electrolyte, Li3InBr6, using synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We demonstrate that the SIT in halide SSEs is driven by a thermally induced transition in bonding character (ionic to covalent) rather than a change in crystal phase. AIMD simulations further reveal enhanced Li&#8314; diffusion and collective anion motion at elevated temperatures. Expanding our study to Li3LnBr6 (Ln&#160;=&#160;Gd, Tb, Ho, Tm, and Lu), we confirm the widespread occurrence of SIT in this material class, with Li3GdBr6 exhibiting the highest ionic conductivity (5.2 mS cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K). More importantly, the ionic&#8208;covalent transition is highly tunable through electrolyte modifications, such as cation/anion substitution and synthesis methods. Our findings provide a new perspective on ionic transport, highlighting the critical role of chemical bond characteristics in halide SSEs.

         <title>&#8220;Gene&#8208;Editing&#8221; Design Upgrades Eutectic&#8208;Polymer Electrolytes with Ultra&#8208;High Li+ Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of &#8220;gene&#8208;editing&#8221; in biology, a novel deep eutectic polymer electrolyte (GEPE) with precisely tailored molecular architectures is proposed. By leveraging steric hindrance and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects from tailored isophorone diisocyanate&#8208;derived segments, GEPEs mitigates strong Li&#8314;&#8208;polymer coordination, enabling ultra&#8208;high Li+ conductivity.








Abstract
Deep eutectic polymer electrolytes (DEPEs) have emerged as highly promising next&#8208;generation electrolytes, offering unparalleled electrochemical performance and safety. Their excellence stems from a synergistic blend of the robust mechanical stability of solid polymer electrolytes and the exceptional interfacial wettability and superior thermal resilience of deep eutectic electrolytes. However, conventional DEPEs frequently exhibit suboptimal Li+ conductivity due to strong coordination between Li+ and oxygen&#8208;containing polymer moieties. Inspired by the concept of &#8216;gene&#8208;editing&#8217; in biology, we propose a novel deep eutectic polymer electrolyte (GEPE) with precisely tailored molecular architectures This approach exploits the steric hindrance and electron&#8208;withdrawing inductive effects from isophorone diisocyanate&#8208;derived segments to reduce Li+&#8208;polymer interactions, thereby enabling an extraordinary ionic conductivity of 3.00 mS cm&#8315;&#185; at 25 &#176;C and a Li+ transference number of 0.61. Remarkably, GEPE exhibits extraordinary cycling stability in Li||Li symmetric cells for over 3000 h, demonstrating dendrite&#8208;free Li metal deposition during prolonged cycling. Moreover, the assembled lithium metal batteries demonstrate exceptional electrochemical performance when incorporating diverse cathodes, including LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, and LiFePO4. Notably, the Li|GEPE|LiFePO4 cells achieve an impressive nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency and remarkable long&#8208;term stability over 10 000 cycles at 5C.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Radical Relay for Remote Alkenylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H Sites in Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Electrophotochemical cerium&#8208;catalyzed radical relay strategy enabling &#948;&#8208;site alkenylation of alcohols. This protocol eliminates the requirement for external redox agents and expensive photosensitizers, directly utilizing hydroxyl groups without preactivation of alcohol substrates, thereby significantly enhancing atom economy and environmental benignity. The reaction demonstrates exceptional compatibility with diverse alcohols and alkenes, greatly expanding the scope of accessible products. Mechanistic investigations have conclusively elucidated the detailed catalytic cycle and radical transfer pathway.








Abstract
The Mizoroki&#8211;Heck reaction is a powerful method for alkene formation from various molecules; however, its application has traditionally been limited to halogenated compounds. Accessing organic molecules with halogen atoms at specific positions in aliphatic systems is highly restricted, and their synthesis is extremely difficult. Therefore, achieving site&#8208;selective alkenylation of alkyl compounds at specific positions remains challenging. This paper presents a versatile redox&#8208;neutral method for the alkenylation of long&#8208;chain alkyl alcohols at unactivated &#948;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sites, enabling the construction of alkenols through electrophotochemical (EPC) cerium (Ce) catalysis with free alcohols. The method demonstrates excellent substrate compatibility, facilitating the use of both primary and secondary alcohols and enabling the successful synthesis of quaternary carbon alkenols. Mechanistically, cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal that the oxidative reaction is driven by electrochemical oxidation at the anode under applied potential. Additionally, styrene boronic acid remains unoxidized during the reaction, confirming a radical addition mechanism rather than a radical&#8211;radical coupling process. UV&#8211;vis experiments further demonstrate that the ligand not only activates the alkene boronic acid but also functions as a base to promote the ligand exchange between alcohol and Ce(IV)&#8722;Cl species.

High&#8208;density basic sites in QPAF&#8208;225 suppressed the PA leakage, illustrating 0.04&#160;mV h&#8722;1 voltage decay (904&#160;h) and robust mechanical stability. This framework&#8208;engineered strategy overcomes PA&#8208;PBI (PA&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole) membrane limitations, enabling durable HT&#8208;PEMFCs.








Abstract
In optimizing the trade&#8208;off between power density and phosphoric acid (PA) retention in PA&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole (PA&#8208;PBI) membrane for improving performance of high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs), the self&#8208;reinforcing network of interfacial interactions of the HT&#8208;PEMs has to be deeply investigated. In this paper, a breakthrough strategy employing a quaternary ammonium (QA)&#8208;functionalized porous aromatic framework (QPAF&#8208;225) to synergistically integrate with sulfonated poly[2,2&#8242;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenylene)&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;bibenzimidazole] (SOPBI) to form the robust HT&#8208;PEM is successfully developed. The ionic interactions between the cationic QA moieties and anionic sulfonic acid groups can establish a self&#8208;reinforcing proton&#8208;conductive network, while the high&#8208;density basic sites in QPAF&#8208;225 act as the PA reservoirs and can mitigate the leakage. When benchmarked against QA&#8208;deficient PAF&#8208;225&#8211;10 (10% PAF&#8208;225 in composite membrane) composite HT&#8208;PEMs and pristine SOPBI, the QPAF&#8208;225&#8211;10 composite delivers a high proton conductivity of 174 mS cm&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C and extremely high peak power density of 847&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 of the HT&#8208;PEMFC under ultralow Pt/C loading (0.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) at 200&#160;&#176;C operation, which surpasses most of PA&#8208;PBI systems reported in literatures. Critically, such a membrane exhibits ultralow voltage decay rate (0.04&#160;mV h&#8722;1 over 904&#160;h at 200&#160;&#176;C) and high PA retention ability, coupled with mechanical robustness exceeding industrial durability thresholds. This work transcends conventional additives by exploiting porous aromatic framework&#8208;mediated proton channels and PA&#8208;philic motifs, establishing a material paradigm for next&#8208;generation HT&#8208;PEMs that reconciles high&#8208;power operation with long&#8208;term stability in harsh electrochemical environments.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Chirality Inversion in Propeller&#8208;Shaped PDI Oligomers with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent propeller&#8208;shaped PDI hexamer exhibiting solvent&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction. The propeller chirality undergoes reversible inversion, enabling discrimination between mixtures of CH2Cl2 and CHCl3.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has the potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. One of the major challenges in this field is the development of CPL emitters, whose emission properties can be modulated by external stimuli, such as solvents. However, CPL&#8208;active materials are often synthetically demanding and typically require chiral separation. To address these limitations, we have synthesized a propeller&#8208;shaped molecule, (R/S)&#8208;Bz&#8208;6PDI 1, via a one&#8208;pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, using a chiral pyrrole&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) 4 as the blade. The introduction of a chiral auxiliary into the blade enabled the induction of propeller chirality without the need for chiral chromatographic separation. (R)&#8208;Bz&#8208;6PDI 1 exhibited high CPL brightness in solution (BCPL&#160;=&#160;103&#8211;369&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1). Furthermore, the propeller chirality proved highly sensitive to the solvent environment, leading to significant modulation of both the sign and intensity of the CD and CPL signals, including complete signal inversion in CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. CD spectral analysis combined with DFT calculations revealed that the propeller chirality is governed by the orientation of the hydrogen atom in the chiral auxiliary.

     alt="Solvent-Induced Chirality Inversion in Propeller-Shaped PDI Oligomers with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly luminescent propeller-shaped PDI hexamer exhibiting solvent-responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) was synthesized via a one-pot reaction. The propeller chirality undergoes reversible inversion, enabling discrimination between mixtures of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has the potential for next-generation optoelectronic applications. One of the major challenges in this field is the development of CPL emitters, whose emission properties can be modulated by external stimuli, such as solvents. However, CPL-active materials are often synthetically demanding and typically require chiral separation. To address these limitations, we have synthesized a propeller-shaped molecule, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Bz-6PDI &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, via a one-pot nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction, using a chiral pyrrole-fused perylene diimide (PDI) &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; as the blade. The introduction of a chiral auxiliary into the blade enabled the induction of propeller chirality without the need for chiral chromatographic separation. (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-Bz-6PDI &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibited high CPL brightness in solution (&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;103&#8211;369&#160;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Ligand Exchange for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Transfer Hydrothiocarbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

Light makes difference: An efficient light&#8208;driven ligand&#8208;exchange paradigm was realized by the photochemical dissociation of CO, which enabled an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrothiocarbonylation of alkenes. The newly established reactions exhibit remarkable functional group compatibility and regioselectivity, which demonstrate its potential as a practical and reliable approach to the regioselective synthesis of thioester compounds.








Abstract
Transfer hydrocarbonylation of alkenes could streamline the synthesis of value&#8208;added carbonylated molecules by avoiding the use of pressurized toxic CO. Existing methods, however, are limited to the use of alcohol&#8208;derived formates or anhydrides as CO and nucleophile&#8208;surrogates, because the parallel mechanism does not work for other transfer carbonylation reagents comprising nucleophilic fragments with higher coordination affinities to transition metals. Herein, we present a novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy to address this challenge by promoting the ligand exchange via facilitating the dissociation of CO instead of nucleophiles, upon which was also an efficient transfer hydrothiocarbonylation of olefins with thioformates successfully established. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, excellent regioselectivities, broad functional group compatibilities, and vital synthetic efficacy. The kinetic analysis unveiled a striking linear correlation between the product concentration and the time&#8208;squared. Furthermore, the kinetic behaviors observed for the substrates were all consistent with the rate law derived from the proposed mechanism. These results demonstrated the pivotal importance of rapid CO dissociation via light excitation to suppress the side reaction of premature reductive elimination.

         <title>Single&#8208;Specie Selectivity via Subnanometer&#160;Hierarchical Porous Channel Metal&#8208;Organic Gels Toward Ultra&#8208;stable Anodes for Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have engineered a PAN based metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) electrolyte embedded with hierarchical sub&#8208;nanochannels to assure long&#8208;term stabilized zinc electrodeposition. In accordance with the ion&#8208;sieving transition state theory, the MOG specifically reduces the sieving activation energy of Zn2+ and facilitate single&#8208;specie selectivity toward Zn2+ via synergistic size exclusion effect and interaction force (including dipole&#8208;dipole interaction forces, electrostatic interaction forces and van der Waals forces), enabling ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes and Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with excellent endurance.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes demonstrate substantial potential for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, yet obtaining exquisite balance between molecular/ion sieving precision enhancement and ion conduction pathway optimization remains a persistent scientific challenge. Here, to assure long&#8208;term stabilized zinc electrodeposition, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;DMF metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) embedded with hierarchical sub&#8208;nanochannels was strategically designed to facilitate single&#8208;specie selectivity toward Zn2+. In accordance with the ion&#8208;sieving transition state theory, the MOG accomplished directional discrimination of DMF solvent and ClO4&#8722; species via synergistic size exclusion effect and interaction force (dipole&#8211;dipole interaction, electrostatic interaction and vdW force), which specifically reduces the sieving activation energy of Zn2+. Furthermore, ClO4&#8722; anions with optimized microstructural dimensions and strong coordination ability have stronger interactions with PAN chain segments and promote the dissociation of Zn2+ from PAN chain segments, which facilitates a smooth Zn2+ flux through distinctive ion transport pathways. Besides, the PAN@ClO4&#8722; complex demonstrates sustainable epitaxial stacking characteristics of crystallographically oriented Zn (002) planes, which promote flat and compact Zn deposition. Consequently, the zinc symmetric battery demonstrates an exceptional cycle life exceeding 7000&#160;h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with extremely lower overpotential (20&#160;mV). Furthermore, the Zn||I2 cell maintains a capacity retention rate of 81.7% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Continuous Intermediates Spillover Boosts Electrochemical Nitrate Conversion to Ammonia over Dual Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous N&#8208;intermediates spillover effect was discovered in electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction. The N&#8208;intermediates spilled over three times back and forth on Mo1 and Fe1 dual single&#8208;atom alloy in searching of the lowest energy barrier. Mo1Fe1Pd metallene delivered excellent performance in NO3RR and zinc&#8208;nitrate battery.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate conversion to ammonia driven by sustainable green electricity is regarded as a promising supplement to the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it is still restricted by the low NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency. Here, we propose a continuous intermediates spillover strategy by constructing dual single&#8208;atom alloy to boost ammonia yield rate and Faradaic efficiency. The intermediates continuously spill over back and forth on the atomically dispersed Mo and Fe sites in Pd lattice, which adaptively experiences low energy barrier for each elementary step in nitrate conversion. As a result, the synthesized dual single&#8208;atom alloy metallene delivered an NH3 yield rate of 13.4&#160;mol gcat.&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, and Faradaic efficiency of 94.6%, as well as remarkable cycling stability of 300&#160;h. Furthermore, the dual single&#8208;atom alloy metallene was assembled into a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as the cathode, which delivered an output voltage of 1.477&#160;V, and the maximum output power density of 13.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Achieving Highly Efficient Luminescence and Multiphoton Absorption Character in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#160;Emitters Based on a Tetrabenzo[a,c]Phenazine Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quadrupolar architectural paradigm has been harnessed to reconcile the competing demands of molecular planarity and orbital separation, thereby facilitating the concurrent realization of multiphoton absorption and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. This molecular engineering approach endows the emitters with efficient triplet harvesting and enhanced nonlinear optical properties, advancing their potential for dual&#8208;mode applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiphoton absorption phenomenon (MPA) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials opens new avenues for bio&#8208;optoelectronic applications. However, the development of TADF emitters that simultaneously exhibit triplet harvesting and MPA is hindered by the challenge of balancing molecular planarity, reduced orbital overlap, and large oscillator strength. In this study, we demonstrate a quadrupolar molecular design based on the tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) to accomplish efficient MPA and TADF performance.

Particularly, TBPZ2TPA blended film exhibits orange&#8208;red emission with a maximum at 589&#160;nm, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#1060;PL) of 71%, a sufficiently small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.16&#160;eV and reversed intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.3 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, it demonstrated a remarkable two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) of 892 GM at 780&#160;nm and an excellent 2PA brightness of 785 GM, along with evident three&#8208;photon absorption (3PA) at 1200&#160;nm. These results provide a compelling strategy for developing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional MPA properties, enabling dual functionality for both OLEDs and high&#8208;resolution bioimaging.

&lt;p&gt;A quadrupolar architectural paradigm has been harnessed to reconcile the competing demands of molecular planarity and orbital separation, thereby facilitating the concurrent realization of multiphoton absorption and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. This molecular engineering approach endows the emitters with efficient triplet harvesting and enhanced nonlinear optical properties, advancing their potential for dual-mode applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of multiphoton absorption phenomenon (MPA) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials opens new avenues for bio-optoelectronic applications. However, the development of TADF emitters that simultaneously exhibit triplet harvesting and MPA is hindered by the challenge of balancing molecular planarity, reduced orbital overlap, and large oscillator strength.

         <title>Operando Spectroscopic Insights into CO2 Reduction at Electrode/Polyelectrolyte Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic mechanism of CO2 reduction at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface was investigated using operando Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. Under the practical working conditions of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer for CO2 and pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, the rate&#8208;determining step for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion was found to shift from C&#8211;C coupling to the subsequent *CCO hydrogenation.








Abstract
The electrode/polyelectrolyte interface is a notable feature in modern electrochemical technologies that utilize membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. However, its interfacial structure and catalytic behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an integrated operando Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) method, to directly investigate the CO2 reduction mechanism at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface within a practical MEA electrolyzer operating at high current densities. Combined with isotope labeling experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we provide, for the first time, the direct spectroscopic evidence of *CCO, a crucial intermediate for C2 product formation, which has been frequently hypothesized but rarely detected in previous studies. By contrast, the linearly adsorbed *COL intermediate, typically observed in conventional liquid electrolytes, was absent. These distinct behaviors arise from the unique structure of the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface, which shifts the rate&#8208;determining step from the usual C&#8211;C coupling to the *CCO hydrogenation in the conversion of CO2 to C2 products. This study not only deepens our understanding of electrode/polyelectrolyte interfacial characteristics but also offers valuable insights for advancing the performance of CO2 MEA electrolyzers.

         <title>AIE&#8208;Driven Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solid&#8208;State Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Hydrochromism, and Water&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A salicylaldehyde azine&#8208;based CCOF exhibiting strong circular dichroism and solid&#8208;state circularly polarized fluorescence was constructed via chiral induction, featuring water&#8208;induced stimuli&#8208;responsive color change and chiroptical activity enhancement.








Abstract
Chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) are promising candidates for chiral optoelectronics and sensing, but their weak solid&#8208;state fluorescence and chiroptical responses often limit practical utility. Here, we introduce a novel CCOF synthesized from achiral monomers, 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarbaldehyde and hydrazine, via imine condensation with a chiral induction strategy, yielding salicylaldehyde azine units with aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Optimized catalyst and chiral inducer stoichiometry endow the framework with exceptional chiroptical properties (|gabs| = 2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2, ellipticity&#160;&#8776;&#160;1000 mdeg). In the solid state, the CCOF exhibits intense red fluorescence (&#955;em&#160;&#8776;&#160;645&#8201;nm) with a large stoke shift and favorable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL, |glum| = 5.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2), marking the first CCOF derived solely from achiral building blocks with robust solid&#8208;state CPL. When integrated into polydimethylsiloxane, it forms flexible and semitransparent composite films suitable for CPL&#8208;based applications. The CCOF also functions as a highly enantioselective fluorescent sensor for chiral analytes, including 2&#8208;aminocyclohenanol and dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine. Furthermore, it demonstrates reversible hydrochromism, transitioning from yellow to orange (&#916;E&#160;&#8776;&#160;42.7), and water&#8208;induced chiroptical enhancement (ellipticity up to 2100 medg, |gabs| = 5.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2), achieving the highest ground&#8208;state chirality reported for CCOFs through enol&#8208;to&#8208;keto tautomerism upon water adsorption. This stimuli&#8208;responsive CCOF overcomes persistent limitations in solid&#8208;state CPL and paves the way for chiral sensing, optical displays, and responsive materials.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Cooperative Strategy for Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Layer toward Fully Printed High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules</title>

         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility is designed, and a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy was further proposed by combining with polymer D18. This strategy successfully solved the issues of unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution in blade&#8208;coated small molecule hole transport layers (HTLs) caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity. Ultimately, a printable, uniform, and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology dopant&#8208;free HTL film facilitated record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04% for small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (0.062 cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules (15.64 cm2).








Abstract
Enabling large&#8208;area deposition of dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport layers (HTLs) with high reproducibility and uniformity is crucial for fully printed n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) modules. However, typical polymer hole transport materials (HTMs), with non&#8208;Newtonian fluid characteristics, show shear rate&#8208;dependent viscosity during the printing process, whereas blade&#8208;coated small&#8208;molecule HTLs often exhibit unfavorable assembly behavior and solute random distribution caused by molecular aggregation and low viscosity; these factors impose challenges on blade&#8208;coating of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area HTL films. Here, we designed a dopant&#8208;free small molecule BDT&#8208;MB with high mobility and further proposed a molecular cooperative (MC) strategy by combining with polymer D18. The mechanism was clearly clarified that the pre&#8208;aggregated polymer D18 acted as a &#8220;seed crystal&#8221; to induce preferential face&#8208;on orientation of small molecule BDT&#8208;MB through intermolecular C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction. This strategy not only suppresses the unfavorable assembly behavior of small molecular HTMs but also overcomes the solute random distribution by tuning the solution with high and constant viscosity. It facilitates printing large&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free HTLs with high uniformity and ordered fiber&#8208;like morphology. The resultant small&#8208;area pero&#8208;SCs (0.062&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area fully printed modules (15.64&#160;cm2) both achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.46% (certified at 24.30%) and 21.04%.

         <title>NPA6: A Molecule for Non&#8208;Covalently Linked Radical&#8208;Enhanced ISC and High&#8208;Performance Photopolymerization with Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule NPA6 can form light&#8208;induced supramolecular assemblies with radicals, thereby achieving noncovalently linked radical&#8208;enhanced ISC. As a photosensitizer in acrylamide polymerization, it achieves nearly 100% conversion at a concentration of 100&#160;ppm under 410&#160;nm light and ambient conditions. The resulting polymers display room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 0.73&#160;s, making them suitable for in situ defect detection. 








Abstract
To harness electron spin exchange for radical&#8208;enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC), a typical strategy involves covalently attaching stable radicals to chromophores. Here, we introduce NPA6, synthesized by attaching heptanamide to N,N&#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;amine (NPA). NPA6 maintains the phosphorescent properties of NPA and exhibits unique photo&#8208;generated radical behavior that is absent in NPA. These radicals can further adsorb neutral molecules to form supramolecular assemblies. Compared to pristine NPA6, these assemblies exhibit nearly complete NMR proton signal suppression in the aromatic region, enhanced absorption near 400&#160;nm, and reduced fluorescence intensity. Phosphorescence measurements at 77&#160;K reveal stronger phosphorescence in the assemblies, with delayed excitation spectra confirming phosphorescence originating exclusively from neutral molecules, indicating successful noncovalent radical&#8208;enhanced ISC. As a photosensitizer in N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide polymerization, NPA6 achieves nearly 100% conversion at 100&#160;ppm under 410&#160;nm light and ambient conditions, exhibiting superior polymerization performance. Additionally, its afterglow makes it suitable as an in situ quality indicator for transparent coatings, suggesting its potential applications in photolithography.

         <title>Modulating Diffusion Kinetics and Interfacial Stability via In&#8208;Situ Constructed Self&#8208;Healing Interfaces for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing polymer interface is constructed by unsaturated N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide molecule (NHMA) self&#8208;polymerization. The layer effectively suppresses the tip effect and significantly enhances the interface stability, meanwhile, it also improves the diffusion kinetics of Zn ions and regulates their ordered deposition, thereby enabling efficient repair of scratches on the Zn surface.








Abstract
Commercial Zn anodes contain inherent manufacturing defects, such as scratches, rough surfaces, fold lines, and microcracks. These surface defects damage the uniformity of the interfacial electric field, exacerbate hydrogen evolution problem and dendrite growth. Herein, a self&#8208;healing polymer interface is constructed by unsaturated N&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide molecules (NHMA) self&#8208;polymerization. The layer effectively suppresses the detrimental tip effect and enhances the interface stability. Meanwhile, it synergistically facilitates the diffusion kinetics of Zn ions and regulates orientated deposition, thereby enabling an efficient repair of scratches on the Zn surface. Furthermore, the NHMA with acylamino and hydroxyl groups is capable of modulating the hydrogen bond network and solvation structure of the electrolyte, further improving the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Benefiting from the enhanced diffusion kinetics and stable NHMA&#8208;derived interfaces, the fabricated symmetrical battery demonstrates a 50&#8208;fold improvement in cycle life under various testing conditions. Moreover, the full battery can maintain a capacity of 101.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 (1.5 times higher than bare Zn//NH4V4O10). This work establishes a novel framework for rational electrolyte engineering and interfacial modulation in aqueous Zn metal batteries, offering fresh perspectives for future research toward practical energy storage applications.

         <title>Thio&#8208;Tetracosulene: A Highly Twisted Molecular Plectoneme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;tetracosulene, the first macrocyclic aromatic compound (MAC) with a plectonemic configuration, has been synthesized by sulfur fluorine annulative substitution. Distinct from topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type MACs which rely on the connection pattern to induce chirality, the asymmetric structure of thio&#8208;tetracosulene is generated and stabilized by the tendency of a macrocycle in distress to reduce unfavourable strain. 








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of thio&#8208;tetracosulene 3, a highly twisted chiral macrocycle constructed via sulfur fluorine annulative substitution from a cyclometaphenylene derivative. It is the first macrocyclic aromatic compound with a plectonemic configuration, and the structure is unambiguously confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study. The two enantiomers of 3 can be resolved to investigate their chiroptical properties. In contrast to the known topological knot&#8208;, or M&#246;bius&#8208;type macrocycles which induce chirality by specific connection patterns, the asymmetric structure of 3 is formed and maintained by the tendency of a ring in distress to reduce unfavorable strains.

         <title>Inwardly Directed Linker Propagation: Constructing 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with triple entanglement were assembled via inwardly directed linker propagation. The efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production by introducing entanglement in COFs was significantly increased.








Abstract
The limited design strategy of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) greatly restricts their structural diversification and potential applications. Herein, we propose an inwardly directed linker propagation strategy for the targeted assembly of 3D COFs (COF&#8208;IN&#8208;1 and COF&#8208;IN&#8208;2) and compare them with outwardly directed expanded COFs (COF&#8208;OUT&#8208;1 and COF&#8208;OUT&#8208;2). COF&#8208;OUTs exhibit planar heteroporous 2D frameworks with cpt topology, while COF&#8208;INs engineer controlled triple entanglements into networks, forming 3D frameworks with acs topology. Moreover, the COFs assembled via inwardly directed linker propagation effectively enhanced the production of H2O2 photosynthesis. To demonstrate the application potential, a biphasic fluid system was constructed for continuous H2O2 photosynthesis and extraction. This work not only expands the design strategy for achieving 3D COFs but also demonstrates that the dimensional regulation of frameworks and tuning of applications can arise from different expanding directions of the linkers.

         <title>Circumventing Scaling Relations via Gradient Orbital Coupling Promotes Ammonia Electrosynthesis on Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy has been proposed to boost NO3&#8722; electroreduction to NH3 through constructing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling by lanthanide element doping in Co3O4 catalyst. It can tune the adsorption and circumvent scaling relations of key *H and *NO intermediates, achieving high faradaic efficiency and good stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.








Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3) relies on the balanced activation of various substrates including nitrate and water, but is currently hindered by the inherent scaling relations governing the adsorption of key reaction intermediates, such as *NO and *H. Herein, we develop a strategy to circumvent these limitations by introducing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling in cobalt oxide (Co3O4) through Ce doping.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient strategy has been proposed to boost NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; electroreduction to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; through constructing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling by lanthanide element doping in Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. It can tune the adsorption and circumvent scaling relations of key *H and *NO intermediates, achieving high faradaic efficiency and good stability over wide potential and nitrate range, providing a new paradigm for electrocatalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) relies on the balanced activation of various substrates including nitrate and water, but is currently hindered by the inherent scaling relations governing the adsorption of key reaction intermediates, such as *NO and *H. Herein, we develop a strategy to circumvent these limitations by introducing f&#8211;d&#8211;p gradient orbital coupling in cobalt oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) through Ce doping. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the lattice strain triggered by the dopant redistributes electron density at the Co and O sites, thereby modulating the adsorption strengths of *NO and *H, which favors the production of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; while suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction. It exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 97.8% and a high yield rate of 3423.0&#160;&#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, Ce/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst shows robust performance over a wide range of nitrate concentrations (from 5 to 200&#160;mM) and excellent cycling stability. Our findings also suggest that the gradient orbital coupling approach can be extended to other lanthanide dopants (e.g., Pr and Nd), offering a broadly applicable platform to break scaling relations and improve NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Simultaneous Boosting of Second Harmonic Generation and Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Hybrid Metal Halides Through Enhanced Octahedral Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing octahedral off&#8208;centering distortion (D${\mathcal{D}}$) has been demonstrated to boost both second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs). A strong SHG intensity of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry (glum) factor of 3.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 are achieved in R&#8208;SbCl6. The combined SHG and CPL performance surpasses that of previously reported chiral HMHs.








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides (HMHs), characterized by their non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystal structures and exceptional photophysical properties, are promising for second&#8208;order nonlinear and linear optics, including second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral HMHs with simultaneously strong SHG response and efficient CPL still present a challenge, due to the distinct structural and electronic requirements of these properties. Here, we report a halogen substitution strategy within inorganic octahedra to modulate the crystal structure and simultaneously enhance both SHG and CPL properties. Three pairs of chiral Sb&#8208;based HMHs are synthesized: (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr6 (MBA = &#945;&#8208;methylbenzylammonium, IA&#160;=&#160;imidazole, abbreviated as R/S&#8208;SbBr6), (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbBr2.8Cl3.2 (R/S&#8208;SbBr2.8Cl3.2), and (R/S&#8208;MBA)2IASbCl6 (R/S&#8208;SbCl6). The gradual halogen substitution from R/S&#8208;SbBr6 to R/S&#8208;SbCl6 significantly enhances the structural chirality of inorganic octahedra, resulting in a strong SHG response intensity of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP and a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of 3.82&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The combination of SHG and CPL performance outperforms that of previous chiral HMHs. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that these enhancements originate from gradually increased octahedral distortions induced by halogen substitution. This work establishes a structural optimization strategy for advancing high&#8208;performance SHG and CPL in chiral HMHs, paving the way for their broader photonic applications.

         <title>Highly Active Pt&#8208;Fe Catalysts Towards CO Preferential Oxidation with an Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>

The high&#8208;efficiency Pt&#8208;Fe(OH)x/MA catalyst with abundant Pt&#948;+&#8211;(OH)x&#8211;Fe3+ interfacial sites was prepared via topological transformation process of hydrotalcite precursor, which exhibited outstanding catalytic performance towards preferential oxidation of CO with an ultra&#8208;wide full CO conversion window (25&#176;C&#8722;225 &#176;C) at a rather high space velocity (130 000&#160;mL gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1).








Abstract
Preferential oxidation of CO in H2 (CO&#8208;PROX) is a promising solution to remove the residual CO in the feed stream to avoid Pt poisoning in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), in which the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts with a wide temperature window remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a Fe(OH)x modified Pt clusters (&#8764;1.6&#160;nm) catalyst supported on MgAlOx (denoted as MA) derived from PtFeMgAl&#8208;layered double hydroxides (PtFeMgAl&#8208;LDHs) precursor, which is featured with abundant Pt&#948;+&#8211;(OH)x&#8211;Fe3+ interfacial sites. Impressively, the optimal catalyst Pt&#8208;Fe(OH)x/MA exhibits exceptional catalytic performance towards CO&#8208;PROX, which can completely remove CO in a H2&#8208;rich stream with an ultra&#8208;wide full CO conversion window (25&#176;C&#8722;225 &#176;C) at a rather high space velocity (130 000&#160;mL gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). The mass&#8208;specific activity reaches to 9.09 molCO gPt&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, which is preponderant to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. In addition, a 240&#160;h stream&#8208;on&#8208;line test over Pt&#8208;Fe(OH)x/MA shows a satisfactory stability. A comprehensive investigation based on in situ experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveals that the &#8211;OH group at the Pt&#948;+&#8211;(OH)x&#8211;Fe3+ interfacial site is easily bound to the linearly&#8208;adsorbed CO at the adjacent Pt&#948;+ site to form carboxylate intermediate, followed by its decomposition to CO2. Meanwhile, the generated coordination unsaturated Fe2+ site facilitates the activation cracking of O2 molecule without energy barrier. A structure design strategy of interfacial synergistic catalysis towards CO&#8208;PROX is proposed in this work, which shows fundamental significance and application prospects in hydrogen purification.

         <title>All&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene Protected Superatomic Ag8 Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The all&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene&#8208;protected silver cluster containing [Ag8K2(CO3)2]6+ units as the central skeleton of a superatomic silver nanoring was prepared through a one&#8208;pot reaction.








Abstract
Atomically precise monolayer&#8208;protected coinage metal nanoclusters (CMNCs) have drawn increasing attention for their diverse structures and intriguing properties. Nevertheless, not all&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic&#8208;carbene (NHC)&#8208;protected atomically precise silver nanoclusters have been synthesized yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of the first all&#8208;NHC&#8208;protected superatomic silver cluster. This NHC&#8208;ligand&#8208;stabilized Ag8 cluster, characterized as Ag8K2L4(CO3)2(PF6)6, was prepared by reacting Ag2O with bisimidazolium salt H2&#8208;L(PF6)2 under alkaline conditions in dimethylformamide via a one&#8208;pot reaction. The results of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and high&#8208;resolution electrospray&#8208;ionization (HR&#8208;ESI) mass spectrometry revealed a cluster centered with a stable Ag8 ring. Energy decomposition analysis combined with the natural orbital for chemical valence method (EDA&#8208;NOCV) was employed to analyze the nature of the Ag&#8211;ligand bonding, and the results suggested that the stabilization energy originated from the strong electrostatic attraction of the Ag8 ring to the NHC ligand. This work is expected to enable new applications of various NHC ligands in the formation of NHC&#8208;protected metal clusters with attractive properties.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise monolayer-protected coinage metal nanoclusters (CMNCs) have drawn increasing attention for their diverse structures and intriguing properties. Nevertheless, not all-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic-carbene (NHC)-protected atomically precise silver nanoclusters have been synthesized yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and crystal structure of the first all-NHC-protected superatomic silver cluster. This NHC-ligand-stabilized Ag&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cluster, characterized as Ag&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Molecular Design and Synthesis of Narrowband Near&#8208;Ultraviolet and Pure Deep&#8208;Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials by an Ether Group Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;lithiation&#8211;borylation reactions produced a new family of N,N&#8208;bridge&#8208;type triphenylboranes that bear ether groups at two ortho positions relative to the boron center. The ether groups enable the fine&#8208;tuning of the HOMO and LUMO energy gap, leading to narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet and pure deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The chromaticity coordinates of the compounds developed in this study are among the best hitherto reported for BT.2020 blue primary.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are promising materials for the development of displays due to their multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) with narrowband emission. However, except for electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions, synthetic strategies for the generation of boron&#8208;containing MR&#8208;TADF molecules remain virtually unexplored. In particular, the synthesis of MR&#8208;TADF emitters that exhibit narrow near&#8208;ultraviolet and pure deep&#8208;blue emission constitutes a challenging task. Here, we present a directed tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;lithiation&#8211;borylation approach that provides a new family of N,N&#8208;bridge&#8208;type triphenylboranes that bear phenylimino groups instead of the methylene groups at the 8&#8208; and 14&#8208;positions and ether groups instead of the hydrogen atoms at the 3&#8208; and 19&#8208;positions of 1&#8208;borapentacyclohenicosanonaene. The effects of the electron&#8208;donating resonance of the oxygen atoms of the ether groups and the incorporation of oxygen atoms in the six&#8208;membered cycle allow the precise tuning of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps, resulting in narrowband near&#8208;ultraviolet and pure deep&#8208;blue TADF with Commission&#8208;International&#8208;de&#8208;l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates (CIEx,y) of (0.142&#8211;0.160, 0.029&#8211;0.063) for the photoluminescence (PL) and (0.146&#8211;0.160, 0.026&#8211;0.053) for the electroluminescence (EL). The CIEx,y for the EL meet the BT.2020 requirement for the blue primary of ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.

This work presents a tri&#8208;phase VSSe/VO2/V2O5 heterojunction cathode, which was fabricated via controlled thermal oxidation phase engineering, achieving 432 mAh g&#8722;1 specific capacity and 12&#160;000&#8208;cycle stability in Zn&#8208;ion batteries through spin&#8208;polarized interfaces, asymmetric heterojunction structure, simultaneous cationic (V3+/V4+/V5+) and multi&#8208;anionic (S2&#8722;/Se2&#8722;/O2&#8722;) redox reactions, and optimized ion transport pathways to boost kinetics, enabling high&#8208;performance grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics and inadequate redox activity in conventional vanadium&#8208;based cathodes. Herein, a thermal oxidation phase&#8208;engineering strategy is proposed to construct a comprising VSSe core and oxygen&#8208;enriched VO2 and V2O5 interfaces triple&#8208;phase heterojunction cathode. This unique architecture leverages a significantly increased specific surface area, which facilitates rapid electrode&#8211;electrolyte interactions and boosts pseudocapacitive contributions. This integrated structure, featuring optimized coordination environments and interfaces, promotes synergistic multi&#8208;anionic (S/Se/O) and cationic (V) redox activity and facilitates efficient charge transfer across the interfaces, overcoming intrinsic limitations of capacity and structural instability often observed in single&#8208;phase materials, especially during prolonged cycling. This optimized cathode achieves a record&#8208;high reversible capacity of 432 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, surpassing mild&#8208;oxidized and over&#8208;oxidized VSSe counterparts. Remarkably, it retains 80% capacity after 14&#160;000 cycles at 30 A g&#8722;1 under cryogenic conditions of &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating unprecedented low&#8208;temperature durability. The structure&#8211;function relationship of heterojunction is driven by enhanced p&#8211;d orbital hybridization and spin polarization effects at the heterointerfaces, contributing to the improved redox activity and kinetics. This work establishes a design paradigm for engineering multi&#8208;phase heterojunction electrodes with tailored surface area and interfacial properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Twist&#8208;Promoted Photoredox Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Defluorination Reactions</title>

MOF Y&#8208;TCPDA bridged by a newly designed, twisted, and photosensitizing ligand has been prepared with a significantly prolonged lifetime of charge&#8208;transfer state and excellent stability toward F&#8722; solutions. Y&#8208;TCPDA competently catalyzed chemoselective defluorinative functionalization and olefin reductive cross&#8208;coupling with high turnover numbers (TON) of up to 9000, outperforming the homogeneous counterparts.








Abstract
The relatively short excited&#8208;state lifetime is one main drawback of organic photosensitizers, resulting in their restricted catalytic capability and high catalyst loadings. We herein report the design of a twisted ligand N9,N9,N10,N10&#8208;tetrakis[(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid]&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthracene diamine (H4TCPDA). Its twisted geometry significantly elongates the lifetime of charge&#8208;transfer state as substantiated by detailed ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic and electrochemical studies. Moreover, its rigid structure benefits the formation of highly crystalline Y&#8208;TCPDA metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent stability toward F&#8722; solutions. Therefore, Y&#8208;TCPDA competently catalyzes chemoselective defluorinative modifications, a challenge remained in MOF catalysis, and olefin reductive cross&#8208;coupling with high turnover numbers of up to 9000. Control experiments underscore the protection of organic photocatalytic centers by the MOF platform, while similar organic catalysts are found to be decomposed in a homogeneous catalytic system.

         <title>Boosting Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Sodium&#8208;Bromine Batteries via Chlorine&#8208;Bromine Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel sodium&#8211;bromine battery system addresses the safety and gas&#8208;related challenges of Na&#8208;Cl2 batteries and the kinetic limitations of Na&#8208;Br2 batteries. By introducing polyanionic BrCl2&#8722;, a stable two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is achieved, significantly enhancing energy density. This work elucidates the critical role of Br&#8208;Cl chemistry, offering a promising strategy for safe and efficient wide&#8208;temperature energy storage.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operable over a wide temperature range is critical for sustainable energy storage. Sodium&#8208;chlorine (Na&#8208;Cl2) batteries show promising high theoretical energy densities but face significant safety challenges due to gaseous chlorine, particularly at high temperatures. Replacing Cl2 with liquid Br2 to construct a new Na&#8208;Br2 battery mitigates gas risks but introduces issues with sluggish reaction kinetics and high&#8208;temperature volatility. To overcome these limitations, we developed a revolutionary Na&#8208;Br(+) battery based on the activated Br+ by Cl&#8722; anions, pioneering a stabilized redox process via Br&#8722;/BrCl2&#8722; conversion. The introduction of Cl&#8722; enhances the reversibility kinetics of bromine species and facilitating the activation of Br+ through polyanions BrCl2&#8722;, enabling additional electron transfer pathways. The Na&#8208;Br(+) battery achieves impressive low polarization (0.18&#160;V) and exhibits wide&#8208;temperature functionality (&#8722;60&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C) with a cycle life exceeding 400 cycles. This heterogeneous halogen activation strategy addresses key gas safety limitations and advances the practicality of metal&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Circular Additive with Multisite Desolvation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fructose (FRU), based on its cyclic molecular framework, directionally assembles a moderate&#8208;thickness EDL at the zinc electrode interface through its nanoscale molecular configuration, quasi&#8208;planar adsorption orientation, and electron delocalization effects. This structure triggers the reconstruction of Zn2+ desolvation pathways via multisite synergistic effects, significantly reducing the desolvation energy barrier, thereby achieving ultrafast interfacial mass transfer kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition behavior.








Abstract
Additive engineering can effectively relieve interface issues of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), but most additives induce the sluggish interface kinetics and boosted polarization, especially at high current density and low temperature. Herein, the relationship between additive molecular structure and desolvation behavior is built by utilizing a series of circular and linear sugar molecules as prototypes, which systematically reveals molecular size, steric configuration, and electronic structure as design criteria for additives to achieve fast desolvation. As indicated by theoretical simulations and experiments, circular fructose (FRU) molecule with small size, quasi&#8208;planar adsorption configuration, and enhanced electron delocalization enables the compact electric double layer (EDL) with shorter Zn2+ diffusion path and lower activation energy via multisite desolvation, thus obtaining the rapid interface kinetics and facilitating highly reversible zinc anode over a wide temperature range. Zn//Zn cell exhibits long cycle life exceeding 9500&#160;h, and Zn//NVO cell maintains 83.92% high&#8208;capacity retention after 2480 cycles under 6.95&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1 lean electrolyte and 11.94&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 high loading.

         <title>Adjustable Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate to Biodegradable Polymer Monomers by Mn&#8208;Catalyzed Solvent Switching Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling PET into biodegradable polymer monomers was achieved through solvent&#8208;switching strategy. Under the catalysis of the Mn complex, the in situ generated diol underwent selective dehydrogenative coupling in methanol, yielding lactic acid (LA) with 98% yield. When the solvent switched to tert&#8208;amyl alcohol, the diol was quantitatively oxidized to glycolic acid (GA).








Abstract
Waste plastics represent a new resource for the chemical industry. In this study, we demonstrate a solvent&#8208;switching strategy to upcycle waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into monomer terephthalic acid (TPA) and key bulk feedstocks for biodegradable polymers, such as lactic acid (LA) or glycolic acid (GA). PET undergoes rapid and mild depolymerization into its monomers TPA and ethylene glycol (EG) under the catalysis of a manganese complex. When methanol (MeOH) is used as the solvent, it undergoes selective dehydrogenative coupling with in situ generated EG, efficiently yielding TPA and LA with yields exceeding 98%. By replacing MeOH with tert&#8208;amyl alcohol (t&#8208;AmOH), PET is quantitatively converted into TPA and GA. The PET conversion mechanism was elucidated through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and molecular model studies. This work presents a sustainable and innovative approach for upcycling waste PET into high&#8208;value products while opening a new route to synthesize biopolymer monomers, which are essential for developing chemically recyclable and biodegradable polymers, thereby advancing the production of sustainable single&#8208;use polymer products.

         <title>Maximizing Accessible Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Sites on Highly Curved Surfaces via Chemical Vapor Deposition for Boosting Multienzyme&#8208;Like Activities of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a strategy to maximize the density of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites on highly curved surfaces, thereby enhancing active site utilization and optimizing the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The prepared catalyst exhibits significantly enhanced multienzyme&#8208;like activities compared to conventional SACs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing catalytic performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have emerged as a highly promising class of next&#8208;generation nanozymes. However, their widespread application remains significantly restricted by low reaction activity, primarily attributed to inefficient site utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we provided a novel approach to maximize accessible Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites on a highly curved surface (hFeSA) through chemical vapor deposition. This innovative catalyst demonstrated superior multienzyme&#8208;like activities compared to the conventional single iron atom catalyst (FeSA) with planar Fe&#8211;N4 sites. Specifically, for peroxidase&#8208;like activity, the hFeSA exhibited a maximal reaction velocity of 1.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M s&#8722;1, a catalytic constant of 5.78 s&#8722;1, and a specific activity of 177.5 U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which were 9.67&#8208;, 2.56&#8208;, and 9.56&#8208;fold higher than those of the conventional FeSA, respectively. Similarly, for oxidase&#8208;like activity, the hFeSA achieved a maximal reaction velocity of 2.84&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7&#160;M s&#8722;1, a catalytic constant of 4.3 s&#8722;1, and a specific activity of 76.27 U&#160;mg&#8722;1, representing enhancements of 11.73&#8208;, 3.11&#8208;, and 12.01&#8208;fold over FeSA, respectively. These results underscore the significant advantages of hFeSA in dramatically enhancing multienzyme&#8208;like activities. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that single iron atoms anchored on curved surfaces can effectively lower the energy barrier, thereby enhancing the intrinsic activity of the Fe&#8211;N4 sites and accelerating reaction kinetics.

         <title>Cooperative Ammonia Formation Catalyzed by Molybdenum and Samarium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of newly prepared samarium complexes were found to work as effective PCET catalysts to facilitate the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation from dinitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. This is the first successful example of samarium complexes working as effective catalysts over 300 times to facilitate the transfer of protons and electrons in the molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation.








Abstract
A series of novel samarium complexes bearing cyclopentadienyl&#8211;amide chelate ligands were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis. The complexes function as effective proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) catalysts, facilitating molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation from dinitrogen under ambient conditions. In this reaction system, the Sm complexes could be recycled over 300 times, and they increased the ammonia formation rate by sevenfold compared to that obtained for reactions occurring in the absence of such complexes. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations indicate that the Sm complexes undergo protonation and reduction to form Sm(II) complexes, which then accelerate proton and electron transfer to the Mo complexes via PCET processes from the terminal proton source and reductant. This paper presents the first successful example of Sm complexes that can function as efficient catalysts for 300 cycles, promoting proton and electron transfer in Mo&#8208;catalyzed ammonia formation.

         <title>Synthesis of Versatile DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aldehydes by Controlled Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled oxidation strategy enables efficient in situ generation of aldehyde&#8208;functionalized DNAs from DNA&#8208;conjugated amines using O2/laccase/TEMPO. This approach facilitates reversible amine&#8211;aldehyde transformations for DNA bioconjugation, and provides access to chemically diverse DNA&#8208;encoded libraries, broadening the toolbox for chemical biology and material science.








Abstract
Aldehyde&#8208;functionalized oligonucleotides have found diverse applications in chemical biology and material science. However, due to the electrophilic nature of aldehydes, incorporating aldehyde functionalities directly into DNA is challenging, particularly for highly reactive alkyl aldehydes. Inspired by natural oxidases, we herein developed a controlled oxidation strategy to generate aldehyde&#8208;functionalized DNAs from synthetically accessible DNA&#8208;conjugated amines in situ. A broad range of DNA&#8208;conjugated alkyl and aryl aldehydes were efficiently produced from the corresponding amines using O2/laccase/TEMPO, with feasible micromole&#8208;scale preparation. Moreover, combining oxidative cleavage of DNA&#8208;conjugated secondary and tertiary amines with reductive amination enabled switchable amine&#8211;aldehyde transformation and reversible solid&#8208;phase bioconjugation of DNA probes. Furthermore, the reactivity &#8220;umpolung&#8221; from nucleophilic amines to electrophilic aldehydes highlights its potential for synthesizing chemically diverse DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs). In summary, the presented controlled oxidation strategy expands the current toolbox to introduce aldehyde functionalities into DNAs within a chemical biological context.

Abstract
Catalytic construction of alkyl fluorides through C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations represents a formidable challenge in modern organofluorine chemistry. In this work, we present a decarboxylative monofluoromethylation protocol enabled by synergistic nickel/photoredox dual catalysis for aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives. A structurally diverse array of tertiary, secondary, and primary N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters underwent efficient conversion to their corresponding fluoromethylated products with excellent functional group tolerance (68 examples, up to 91% yield). The methodology's versatility was highlighted through late&#8208;stage monofluoromethylation of pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal the involvement of a radical rebound pathway mediated by nickel(III) intermediate, with the homolytic substitution (SH2) process at sterically congested center representing a critical mechanistic distinction from conventional cross&#8208;coupling paradigms.

         <title>Intramolecular Dual Donor&#8208;Acceptor Featured Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled by Gating Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Finely tailored intramolecular dual donor&#8208;acceptor decorated covalent organic framework (designated as TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF) with two electron migration routes (dual D&#8594;A) and sufficient surface sodiophilic centers is explored as a guiding Na+ transport accelerator via gating effects to exclude competitive anion near Na interface for facilitating the uniform Na deposition.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) face severe challenges of uncontrolled sodium dendrite growth and interfacial instability. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a distinct locally polarized covalent organic framework (TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF) was synthesized and employed as a Na&#8314; transport accelerator to promote uniform Na deposition. TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF excited the gating effect (a high gating ratio of 23.1) through electronic response to accomplish the separation of Na+ from the electrolyte solvent via the sodiophilic sites (&#8208;O&#8208;C&#9552;C units, C&#9552;N linkages, C&#9472;Br bonds, and aromatic rings). Simultaneously, it synergistically induced two electron migration routes based on the dual donor&#8208;acceptor (linkages and linkers) structures, thereby enhancing both electron separation efficiency and Na+ cations&#8217; transport. Benefiting from that, the TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF&#8208;based symmetric battery achieved an ultra&#8208;stable operating time of 1000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full battery based on the modified Na@TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF electrode and the carbon&#8208;coated Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) demonstrated high compatibility and good cycling stability. Theoretical calculation and in situ spectra measurements have jointly proved the molecular stability and mechanical robustness. Therefore, this investigation unveils an unconventional method for creating COF&#8208;based protective layers for the practical SMBs.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Mediated Photoreversible Switch Between 2D and 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting weak hydrogen bonds and solution processability of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), reversible switch between two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOF is realized by light&#8208;triggered ring&#8208;open/close isomerization of diarylethene unit. Lanthanide is loaded into the HOF and utilized as a security ink, enabling the photoreversible conversion of visible/invisible information patterns.








Abstract
In photoresponsive crystalline porous materials, the light&#8208;driven reversible topological transformation is of particular interest, as it can cause an overall change in structure and lead to more drastic switch in material properties, but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;OF) self&#8208;assembled by photochromic diarylethene (DAE) and tetrakis(4&#8208;amidiniumphenyl)methane (TAM) via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Light irradiation drives isomerization of DAE, and the internal strain generated during photoisomerization is released through dissolution and recrystallization, which are accompanied by the breaking and reestablishment of hydrogen bonds. Benefit from the weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds as well as the good solution processability of HOFs, solution&#8208;mediated reversible switch between 3D and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) HOF is achieved by ring&#8208;open/ring&#8208;close photoisomerization of the DAE moiety controlled by remotely alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Loading lanthanide complex into HOF enables DAE photoisomerization&#8208;controlled photochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the lanthanide and DAE moiety, resulting in reversible luminescence on/off switch in the host&#8208;guest, capable of intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting in a noninvasive manner.

&lt;p&gt;Exploiting weak hydrogen bonds and solution processability of hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), reversible switch between two-dimensional and three-dimensional HOF is realized by light-triggered ring-open/close isomerization of diarylethene unit. Lanthanide is loaded into the HOF and utilized as a security ink, enabling the photoreversible conversion of visible/invisible information patterns.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In photoresponsive crystalline porous materials, the light-driven reversible topological transformation is of particular interest, as it can cause an overall change in structure and lead to more drastic switch in material properties, but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogen-bonded organic framework (&lt;b&gt;HOF-OF&lt;/b&gt;) self-assembled by photochromic diarylethene (DAE) and tetrakis(4-amidiniumphenyl)methane (TAM) via charge-assisted hydrogen bonds. Light irradiation drives isomerization of DAE, and the internal strain generated during photoisomerization is released through dissolution and recrystallization, which are accompanied by the breaking and reestablishment of hydrogen bonds. Benefit from the weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds as well as the good solution processability of HOFs, solution-mediated reversible switch between 3D and two-dimensional (2D) HOF is achieved by ring-open/ring-close photoisomerization of the DAE moiety controlled by remotely alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Loading lanthanide complex into HOF enables DAE photoisomerization-controlled photochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the lanthanide and DAE moiety, resulting in reversible luminescence on/off switch in the host-guest, capable of intelligent anti-counterfeiting in a noninvasive manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable H2O2 Production via O2 Reduction Using Immobilized Vanadyl Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical H2O2 production via 2e&#8315; ORR is a green alternative to the emission&#8208;heavy anthraquinone process, but selectivity at practical current remains low. We develop a vanadium catalyst composite achieving&#160;&gt;90% H&#8322;O&#8322; selectivity at 3.5 A cm&#8722;2 in acid. In situ spectroscopy shows robust vanadium coordination preserves *OOH and suppresses O&#9472;O bond cleavage under high cathodic potentials.








Abstract
The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, achieving selective H2O2 production at practically relevant current densities (i.e., ampere&#8208;level) remains challenging due to significant selectivity deterioration at high rates. In this study, we develop a composite catalyst by immobilizing vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) on carbon nanotube (CNT) substrates and evaluate its performance under conditions relevant to practical ORR electrolysis. Encouragingly, the VOPc/CNT catalyst composite achieves a high ORR current density of up to 3.5 A cm&#8722;2 with over 90% selectivity toward H2O2 in acidic media. Through various in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the structural integrity of the vanadium catalytic center in VOPc plays a pivotal role in stabilizing *OOH adsorption and impeding O&#9472;O cleavage under high cathodic potentials, which is critical for achieving high H&#8322;O&#8322; selectivity at elevated current densities.

         <title>NbGa2S4(S2): A Rare Linear [S2]2&#8722; Coordination to Niobium Resulting in Simultaneously Large SHG Effect and Giant Birefringence</title>

         <dc:description>
A rare linear [S2]2&#8722; dimer coordinated to Nb4+ in NbGa2S4(S2) results in exceptional bonding flexibility, which gives rise to giant optical anisotropy, a strong second harmonic generation effect and significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion.








Abstract
We report a novel niobium thiogallate, NbGa2S4(S2), featuring a rare linear [S2]2&#8722; coordination to niobium, which simultaneously exhibits a strong second harmonic generation effect [1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;benchmark AgGaS2 (AGS)], a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (5.7&#160;&#215;&#160;AGS), and a giant birefringence (0.29 at 2 &#181;m, the largest among all reported 3D chalcogenides). Theoretical studies reveal that the polarizability anisotropy and hyperpolarizability are significantly enhanced due to the unique alignment of [S2]2&#8722; dimer within the crystal lattice. Additionally, the compound demonstrates exceptional chemical bond flexibility, which leads to significantly reduced thermal anisotropic expansion, one order of magnitude smaller than that of the benchmark AGS. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation functional materials with tailored optical and thermal characteristics.

         <title>Tailoring Coordination Microenvironment of Nickel Molecular Complexes for Electrooxidation of Organic Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular electrocatalysts featuring atomically dispersed nickel sites were synthesized via coordination with aromatic ligands on functionalized carbon black, enabling efficient electrooxidation of diverse organic substrates with high peak current densities. The dynamic transition of nickel centers facilitates C&#9472;H and C&#9472;C bond cleavage, driving the overall catalytic performance.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of organic nucleophiles to value&#8208;added chemicals using nickel&#8208;based catalysts is promising yet hindered by the dynamic evolution of nickel coordination structures during catalysis. Herein, we engineered atomically exposed nickel molecular catalysts anchored on functional carbon black through tailored aromatic ligands coordination. This unique spatial coordination structure efficiently promotes the reconstruction of high&#8208;valence NiIII&#8208;OOH sites, which boost electrooxidation of 18 organic substrates with peak current density exceeding 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Especially, the optimal electrocatalyst achieves record mass activities of 4.38 and 4.26 A mgNi&#8722;1 for methanol and ethylene glycol oxidation, respectively. In situ characterization and theoretical analyses elucidate that the atomically exposed NiIII&#8208;OOH centers would directly adsorb organic substrates, thereby enhancing C&#9472;C/C&#9472;H bonds cleavage efficiency. Meanwhile, the proton abstraction from C&#9472;H bond would enable reversible redox cycling between NiII&#8208;OH and NiIII&#8208;OOH, sustaining catalytic activity. This study advances the understanding of organic oxidation mechanisms and showcases the great potential of molecular complexes in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Fast Removing Ligands from Platinum&#8208;Based Nanocatalysts by a Square&#8208;Wave Potential Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 32, August 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A square&#8208;wave potential (SWP) strategy is developed to efficiently remove the ligands from the surface of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based nanocatalysts in 1 min (40&#160;s), and its removal efficiency is 30 times higher than that of the traditional cyclic voltammetry cycling. The strategy is efficient and universal, which is comprehensively evidenced by physical characterizations and catalytic performance comparisons in the manuscript.








Abstract
Developing effective methods to remove ligands from the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial for obtaining surface&#8208;cleaned nanocatalysts. In this manuscript, we develop a square&#8208;wave potential (SWP) strategy that efficiently removes ligands from the surface of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based nanocatalysts within 1 min (40 s), achieving a removal efficiency 30 times higher than that of traditional cyclic voltammetry cycling. Comprehensive analyses of physical characterization and catalytic performance confirm the effectiveness of the SWP strategy. In situ electrochemical infrared and Raman spectroscopy show that the oxidation potential (1.24&#160;V) can replace the Pt&#8208;N coordination bond with a Pt&#9472;O covalent bond to form the intermediate state of Pt&#8208;O&#8208;NH2R during ligand removal, while the reduction potential (0.20 V) can detach the ligand from the surface of Pt. Moreover, the SWP strategy is versatile, extending the efficient removal of various ligands from the surface of Pt and the oleylamine ligand from Pt&#8208;based alloy nanocatalysts. The efficient removal of ligands from nanocatalysts is critical for ensuring the reproducibility of electrocatalytic results and for obtaining clean catalysts to reveal intrinsic effects in nanocatalysis.

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser-generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;&#8208;systems. This &#960;&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#8211;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from&#160;gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of&#160;tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropane diboronates in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n &lt; 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals, (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates.&#160;Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm.&#160; Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO&#160;at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Indolocarbazole&#8208;Bridged Multiple Resonance Emitter through Steric Pre&#8208;Substitution for Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi&#8208;nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre&#8208;substitution strategy is devised using tert&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;functionalized indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W&#8208;1. The efficiency roll&#8208;off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m&#8208;2 and 5,000 cd m&#8208;2, respectively. This work establishes a pre&#8208;substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid&#8208;state emission for high&#8208;performance MR emitters.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple resonance (MR) emitters bridged by multi-nitrogen indolocarbazoles to extend molecule skeletons could modify emission maximums without scarifying narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), which, however, face synthesis challenges of uncontrollable borylation regioselectivity and spectral broadening issue from intermolecular aggregation. Here, a steric pre-substitution strategy is devised using tert-butylphenyl-functionalized indolo[3,2-b]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora-Friedel-Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter therefore achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W-1. The efficiency roll-off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1,000 cd m-2 and 5,000 cd m-2, respectively. This work establishes a pre-substitution paradigm to concurrently optimize synthesis control and solid-state emission for high-performance MR emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Strategies Applied to the Late&#8208;Stage Modifications of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the potential of mechanochemistry in the late&#8208;stage modification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), offering a comprehensive analysis of methods designed to transform structurally complex molecular scaffolds. By examining the scope, efficiency, and mechanistic aspects of these approaches, the review highlights protocols capable of effectively modifying structurally complex molecular scaffolds. To further assist researchers, we provide a detailed table summarizing the discussed APIs, their respective modifications, and any necessary pre&#8208;functionalizations. This resource should provide a practical guide for selecting suitable substrates to evaluate the pharmaceutical relevance of existing and novel (mechano)chemical methods.</dc:description>
