         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Primary Chlorides by&#160;Selective Chlorocarbonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized primary alkyl chlorides are precursors to a plethora of scaffolds but their access from chemical feedstocks remains&#160;challenging. Herein, we report a concise dual Ni/photoredox catalytic protocol for regioselective chlorocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes that enables rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides. The catalytic process features an extensive substrate scope, scalability and functional group tolerance. The Ni/photocatalytic Cl&#8226; generation and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling is implicated for the process based on the control experiments and DFT study. Synthetic utility of the protocol has been further corroborated through functionalization of complex substrates and post&#8208;modifications of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;modulated Ion Conductor with Chain Conformational Transformation for Enhanced Interfacial Phase Stabilization of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), the inhomogeneous electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase layer aggravates the interfacial stability, leading to discontinuous interfacial ion/charge transport and continuous degradation of the electrolyte. Herein, we constructed an anion&#8208;modulated ionic conductor (AMIC) that enables in&#8208;situ construction of electrolyte/electrode interphases for high&#8208;voltage SSLMBs by exploiting conformational transitions under multiple interactions between polymer and lithium salt anions. Anions modulate the decomposition behavior of supramolecular poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVC) at the electrode interface by changing the spatial conformation of the polymer chains, which further enhances ion transport and stabilizes the interfacial morphology. In addition, the AMIC weakens the &#8220;Li+&#8208;solvation&#8221; and increases Li+ vehicle sites, thereby enhancing the lithium&#8208;ion transport number (tLi+ = ~0.67). Consequently, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell maintains about 85% capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency &gt; 99.8% in 200 cycles at a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5V. This study provides a new understanding of lithium salt anions regulating polymer chain segment behavior in the SPE and highlights the importance of the ion environment in participating in the construction of interfacial phases and ionic conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Topologically Tunable Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Modulating Conductivity and Chemiresistive Properties for NH3 Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) have garnered significant attention in materials science due to their potential applications in modern electrical devices. However, achieving effective modulation of their conductivity has proven to be a major challenge. In this study, we have successfully prepared cMOFs with high conductivity by incorporating electron&#8208;donating fused thiophen rings in the frameworks and extending their &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems through ring&#8208;closing reactions. The conductivity of cMOFs can be precisely modulated ranging from 10&#8208;3 to 102 S m&#8208;1 by regulating their dimensions and topologies. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent tunable electrical properties based on topology, we successfully demonstrated the potential of these materials as chemiresistive gas sensors with an outstanding response toward 100 ppm NH3 at room temperature. This work not only provides valuable insights into the design of functional cMOFs with different topologies but also enriches the cMOF family with exceptional conductivity properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Strained Induced Spin Regulation Hydrogen Bonding in Co&#8208;N/S&#8208;coordination&#8208;framework Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the bottleneck of metal&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. Strain regulation can change the geometry and adjust the surface charge distribution of catalysts, which is a powerful strategy to optimize the ORR activity. The introduction of controlled strain to the material is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we present a temperature&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced strategy to achieve the controlled lattice strain for metal coordination polymers. Through the systematic study of the strain effect on ORR performance, the relationship between geometric and electronic effects is further understood and confirmed. The strained Co&#8208;DABDT (DABDT=2,5&#8208;diaminobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiol) with 2% lattice compression exhibits a superior half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81 V. Theoretical analysis reveals that the lattice strain changes spin&#8208;charge densities around S atoms for Co&#8208;DABDT, and then regulates the hydrogen bond interaction with intermediates to promote the ORR catalytic process. This work helps to understand the catalytic mechanism from the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Tolerant Superbase Polyoxometalate&#160;[H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722;&#160;for Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, doubly protonated Lindqvist&#8208;type niobium oxide cluster [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8211; fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis exhibited superbase catalysis for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions accompanied by activating C&#8211;H bond with pKa &gt;26 and proton abstraction from a base indicator with pKa = 26.5. Surprisingly, [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8211; exhibited water&#8208;tolerant superbase properties for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions in the presence of water, although it is well known that the strong basicity of metal oxides and organic superbase is typically lost by the adsorption of water. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the basic surface oxygens that share the corner of NbO6 units in [H2(Nb6O19)]8&#8211; maintained the negative charges even after proton adsorption. This proton capacity and the presence of un&#8208;protonated basic&#160;sites led to the water tolerance of the superbase catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Glutathione Induced In&#8208;situ Synthesis of Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Anaerobic Glycolysis Metabolism Interference for Boosting Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozyme (SAzyme) has sparked increasing interest for catalytic antitumor treatment due to their more tunable and diverse active sites than natural metalloenzymes in complex physiological conditions. However, it is usually a hard task to precisely conduct catalysis at tumor sites after intravenous injection of those SAzyme with high reactivity. Moreover, the explorations of SAzymes in the anticancer application are still in its infancy and need to be developed.&#160;Herein, an in&#8208;situ synthesis strategy for Cu SAzyme&#160;was constructed to convert adsorbed copper ions into isolated atoms anchored by oxygen atoms (Cu&#8208;O2/Cu&#8208;O4) via GSH&#8208;responsive deformability of supports. Our results suggest that the in&#8208;situ activation process could further facilitate the dissociation of copper ions and the consumption of glutathione, thereby leading to copper deposition in cytoplasm and triggering cuproptosis. Moreover, the in&#8208;situ synthesis of Cu SAzyme with peroxidase&#8208;like activity enabled the intracellular reactive oxygen species production, resulting in specifically disturbance of copper metabolism pathway. Meanwhile, the in&#8208;situ exposed glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor phloretin (Ph) can block the glycose uptake to boost cuproptosis efficacy. Overall, this in situ activation strategy effectively diminished the off&#8208;target effects of SACs&#8208;induced catalytic therapies and introduced a promising treatment paradigm for advancing cuproptosis&#8208;associated therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Principinol B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have accomplished the first and asymmetric total synthesis of principinol B, a grayanoids possessing an oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.2.1] architecture. A functionalized 5/7/6/5 tetracyclic intermediate was assembled in a convergent manner by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and a following carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis of two enantioenriched fragments. The oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.2.1] architecture constituted of a 6,10&#8208;epoxide was constructed by a Williamson ether synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry is put forward based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. The reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and its broad applicability is demonstrated with examples of on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein modification.







Abstract
Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is modular, predictable, and high&#8208;yielding, features fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and works well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx)), selenomacrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry developments, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes Embedding Azulene and Stone&#8208;Wales Topologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations.







Abstract
The incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid motifs in graphene nanostructures significantly impacts their properties, making them attractive for applications in carbon&#8208;based electronics. However, understanding how specific non&#8208;benzenoid structures influence their properties remains limited, and further investigations are needed to fully comprehend their implications. Here, we report an on&#8208;surface synthetic strategy toward fabricating non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. After thermal activation of the precursor P on the Au(111) surface, we detected two major nanographene products. Nanographene Aa&#8722;a embeds two azulene units formed through oxidative ring&#8208;closure of methyl substituents, while Aa&#8722;s contains one azulene unit and one Stone&#8208;Wales defect, formed by the combination of oxidative ring&#8208;closure and skeletal ring&#8208;rearrangement reactions. Aa&#8722;a exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with the highest magnetic exchange coupling reported up to date for a non&#8208;benzenoid containing nanographene, coexisting with side&#8208;products with closed shell configurations resulted from the combination of ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;rearragement reactions (Ba&#8722;a, Ba&#8722;s, Bs&#8208;a and Bs&#8722;s). Our results provide insights into the single gold atom assisted synthesis of novel NGs containing non&#8208;benzenoid motifs and their tailored electronic/magnetic properties.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation over Bicomponent Catalysts through Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium, which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with copper, which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on palladium at low overpotentials and facilitate palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen transfer and timely desorptive hydrogenation on copper. As a result, a record high alkene production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved over this system at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation under mild conditions is a more attractive approach for alkene production than industrial routes but suffers from either low production efficiency or high energy consumption. Here, we describe a tandem catalytic concept that overcomes these challenges. Component (i), which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with component (ii), which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on component (i) at low overpotentials and timely (i)&#8208;to&#8208;(ii) hydrogen spillover and facile desorptive hydrogenation on component (ii). We examine this concept over bicomponent palladium&#8208;copper catalysts for the production of representative 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) from 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyne&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) and achieve a record high MBE production rate of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faraday efficiency of ~88.8&#8201;% at a low energy consumption of 1.26&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgMBE&#8722;1. With these catalysts, we further achieve 60&#8197;h continuous production of MBE with record high profit space.

         <title>Synergetic Modulation of Steric Hindrance and Excited State for Anti&#8208;Quenching and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation results in high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorophores (IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz) with anti&#8208;quenching behavior and fast spin&#8208;flip. A device based on IDAD&#8208;BNCz with a high doping level of 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% shows a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold great promise for advanced high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. However, persistent challenges, such as severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and slow spin&#8208;flip, hinder their optimal performance. We propose a synergetic steric&#8208;hindrance and excited&#8208;state modulation strategy for MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which is demonstrated by two blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, IDAD&#8208;BNCz and TIDAD&#8208;BNCz, bearing sterically demanding 8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IDAD) and 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;8,8&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (TIDAD), respectively. These rigid and bulky IDAD/TIDAD moieties, with appropriate electron&#8208;donating capabilities, not only effectively mitigate ACQ, ensuring efficient luminescence across a broad range of dopant concentrations, but also induce high&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited states that facilitate triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip without causing undesired emission redshift or spectral broadening. Consequently, implementation of a high doping level of IDAD&#8208;BNCz resulted in highly efficient narrowband electroluminescence, featuring a remarkable full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 34&#8197;nm and record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiencies of 34.3&#8201;% and 31.8&#8201;% at maximum and 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively. The combined steric and electronic effects arising from the steric&#8208;hindered donor introduction offer a compelling molecular design strategy to overcome critical challenges in MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Repaired g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets: Elevating the Efficacy of Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Through Enhanced Charge Carrier Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant number of structural defects are the primary factor limiting the catalytic performance of g&#8208;C3N4. Here, a reduction in bulk defects within g&#8208;C3N4 is achieved by optimizing the mass transfer process in the synthesis pathway, resulting in enhanced sonodynamic therapy (SDT) through facilitated charge carrier migration.







Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has garnered growing interest owing to its high tissue penetration depth and minimal side effects. However, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers remains the primary limiting factor for the clinical application of this treatment method. Here, defect&#8208;repaired graphene phase carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) nanosheets are prepared and utilized for enhanced SDT in anti&#8208;tumor treatment. After defect engineering optimization, the bulk defects of g&#8208;C3N4 are significantly reduced, resulting in higher crystallinity and exhibiting a polyheptazine imide (PHI) structure. Due to the more extended conjugated structure of PHI, facilitating faster charge transfer on the surface, it exhibits superior SDT performance for inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. This work focuses on introducing a novel carbon nitride nanomaterial as a sonosensitizer and a strategy for optimizing sonosensitizer performance by reducing bulk defects.

         <title>Back Cover: A Single Set of Well&#8208;Designed Aptamer Probes for Reliable On&#8208;site Qualitative and Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Quantitative Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;function biosensing system based on supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA) and solid&#8208;state nanochannels with hydrophobic partition modification was developed by Yu Huang, Fan Xia et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316434). Based on the disassembly of SSW&#8208;DNA, during the target recognition, the on&#8208;site detection is achieved by introducing fluorescent molecules on SSW&#8208;DNA and using test strips. Since the entire detection system only involves one target identification process, it introduces only one potential error propagation, thereby reducing the overall risk of errors in the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process.

         <title>Dithienoquinoxalineimide&#8208;based Polymer Donor Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Over 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for commercial applications owing to their outstanding advantages such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and stable film morphology. However, compared to large amount of new&#8208;emerging excellent polymer acceptors, the development of high&#8208;performance polymer donor lags behind. Herein, a new D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type polymer donor, namely QQ1, was developed based on dithienoquinoxalineimide (DTQI) as the A unit, benzodithiophene with thiophene&#8208;conjugated side chains (BDTT) as the D unit, and alkyl&#8208;thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridge, respectively. QQ1 not only possesses a strong dipole moment, but also shows a wide bandgap of 1.80 eV and a deep HOMO energy level of &#8208;5.47 eV, even without halogen substituents that are commonly indispensable for high&#8208;performance polymer donors. When blended with a classic polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, the QQ1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC delivers an outstanding PCE of 18.81%. After the introduction of F&#8208;BTA3 as the third component, a record PCE of 19.20% was obtained, the highest value reported so far for all&#8208;PSCs. The impressive photovoltaic performance originates from broad absorption range, reduced energy loss, and compact &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of all&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A high&#8208;yielding active template click reaction (AT&#8208;CuAAC) for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) represent an exciting yet underexplored area of research in the context of carbon nanoscience. Recently, work from our group and others has shown that small carbon nanotube fragments&#8212;[n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related nanohoop macrocycles&#8212;may be integrated into mechanically interlocked architectures by leveraging supramolecular interactions, covalent tethers, or metal&#8208;ion templates. Still, available synthetic methods are typically difficult and low yielding and general methods that allow for the creation of a wide variety of these structures are limited. Here we report an efficient route to interlocked nanohoop structures via the active template Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8208;CuAAC) reaction. With the appropriate choice of substituents, a macrocyclic precursor to 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl embedded [9]CPP (bipy[9]CPP) participates in the AT&#8208;CuAAC reaction to provide [2]rotaxanes in near&#8208;quantitative yield, which can then be converted to the fully p&#8208;conjugated catenane structures. Through this approach two nanohoop[2]catenanes are synthesized which consist of a bipy[9]CPP catenated with either Tz[10]CPP or Tz[12]CPP (where Tz denotes a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety replacing one phenylene ring in the [n]CPP backbone).</dc:description>

         <title>Triply Selective &amp; Sequential Diversification at Csp3: Expansion of Alkyl Germane Reactivity for C&#8208;C &amp; C&#8208;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the triply selective and sequential diversification of a single Csp3 carbon carrying Cl, Bpin and GeEt3 for the modular and programmable construction of sp3&#8208;rich molecules. Various functionalizations of Csp3&#8208;Cl and Csp3&#8208;BPin (e.g. alkylation, arylation, homologation, amination, hydroxylation) were tolerated by the Csp3&#8208;GeEt3 group. Moreover, the methodological repertoire of alkyl germane functionalization was significantly expanded beyond the hitherto known Giese addition and arylation to alkynylation, alkenylation, cyanation, halogenation, azidation, C&#8208;S bond formation as well as the first demonstration of stereo&#8208;selective functionalization of a Csp3&#8208;[Ge] bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Showing Tautomerism and Colorful Luminescence for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) based on tautomers has been constructed from triarylamidine bromide salts. The HOF exhibits both structural phase transition and proton transfer tautomerism under external stimulation, accompanied by color&#8208;switching of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The HOF can be used for the highly sensitive and specific detection of acetone.







Abstract
Tautomers coexisting in an equilibrium system have significant potential for regulating luminescent properties because of their structural differences. However, separating and stabilizing tautomers at room temperature is a considerable challenge. In this study, it is found that hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) composed of Br&#8208; anions can effectively separate and stabilize two proton&#8208;transfer tautomers of triarylformamidinium bromide: namely, the nitrogen cation (BA&#8208;N) and carbon cation (BA&#8208;C). The BA&#8208;N crystal consisting of a dense anionic HOF and parallelly aligned organic cations exhibits green thermally activated delayed fluorescence and red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). The BA&#8208;C crystal contains acetone molecules that induce an antiparallel arrangement of the organic cations to form a loose HOF, producing blue prompt fluorescence and green RTP. Interestingly, switching of the HOFs between BA&#8208;N and BA&#8208;C can be achieved through the uptake and release of acetone, thereby dynamically adjusting multiple luminescent properties. Consequently, the HOF crystals can be used for the highly sensitive and specific sensing of acetone with a detection limit of 66.74&#8197;ppm. This study not only stabilizes tautomeric luminescent materials at room temperature, but also provides a new method for constructing smart HOFs with a sensitive response to a stimulus.

         <title>Torsional Strain Enabled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Axially Chiral Semiaromatic Polyesters with Chemical Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain while preserving an excellent recyclability. Remarkably, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material.







Abstract
The development of new chemically recyclable polymers via monomer design would provide a transformative strategy to address the energy crisis and plastic pollution problem. Biaryl&#8208;fused cyclic esters were targeted to generate axially chiral polymers, which would impart new material performance. To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain. Impressively, Me&#8208;DBO readily went through well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, producing polymer P(Me&#8208;DBO) with high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C). Intriguingly, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material, affording a semicrystalline stereocomplex with a melting transition temperature more than 300&#8201;&#176;C. P(Me&#8208;DBO) were capable of depolymerizing back to Me&#8208;DBO in high efficiency, highlighting an excellent recyclability.

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion in Ultralight NaB(CN)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaB(CN)4 exhibits a giant negative thermal expansion behaviour (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.24&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) with interesting ultralight mass density properties. Non&#8208;rigid vibrational modes, characterized by a maximum negative Gruneisen parameter, play a key factor in the generation of the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4.







Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is crucial for controlling the thermomechanical properties of functional materials, albeit being relatively rare. This study reports a giant NTE (&#945;V&#8764;&#8722;9.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 100&#8211;200&#8197;K; &#945;V&#8764;&#8722;3.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, 200&#8211;650&#8197;K) observed in NaB(CN)4, showcasing interesting ultralight properties. A comprehensive investigation involving synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations has been conducted to explore the thermal expansion mechanism. The findings indicate that the low&#8208;frequency phonon modes play a primary role in NTE, and non&#8208;rigid vibration modes with most negative Gr&#252;neisen parameters are the key contributing factor to the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4. This work presents a new material with giant NTE and ultralight mass density, providing insights for the understanding and design of novel NTE materials.

         <title>Site&#8208;Isolated Rhodium(II) Metalloradicals Catalyze Olefin Hydrofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenization of Rh(II) porphyrin catalysts in a metal&#8211;organic framework is crucial for catalyst turnover in thermal olefin hydrosilylation and hydrogermylation. Unlike MOF&#8208;supported metalloradical catalysts, homogeneous analogues convert to closed shell species that obstruct catalytic turnover. Site&#8208;isolated Rh(II) metalloradicals are readily accessed via MOF synthesis with a linker containing a metal&#8208;alkyl bond followed by Rh&#8722;C photolysis.







Abstract
Rh(II) porphyrin complexes display pronounced metal&#8208;centered radical character and the ability to activate small molecules under mild conditions, but catalysis with Rh(II) porphyrins is extremely rare. In addition to facile dimerization, Rh(II) porphyrins readily engage in kinetically and thermodynamically facile reactions involving two Rh(II) centers to generate stable Rh(III)&#8722;X intermediates that obstruct turnover in thermal catalysis. Here we report site isolation of Rh(II) metalloradicals in a MOF host, which not only protects Rh(II) metalloradicals against dimerization, but also allows them to participate in thermal catalysis. Access to PCN&#8208;224 or PCN&#8208;222 in which the porphyrin linkers are fully metalated by Rh(II) in the absence of any accompanying Rh(0) nanoparticles was achieved via the first direct MOF synthesis with a linker containing a transition&#8208;metal alkyl moiety, followed by Rh(III)&#8722;C bond photolysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Rod&#8208;Coil Bottlebrush Copolymers into Degradable Nanodiscs with a UV&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Immolation Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tadpole&#8208;like amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymer (BBC) with UV&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolative poly(ethyl glyoxylate) side chains are prepared. Through direct self&#8208;assembly such BBC in water, nanoparticles with disc&#8208;like morphologies can be prepared. Upon UV irradiation, these nanodiscs demonstrate controlled degradation and disassembly, transitioning from discs to micelles, and facilitating targeted molecular release.







Abstract
Polymer nanodiscs, especially with stimuli&#8208;responsive features, represent an unexplored frontier in the nanomaterial landscape. Such 2D nanomaterials are considered highly promising for advanced biomedicine applications. Herein, we designed a rod&#8208;coil copolymer architecture based on an amphiphilic, tadpole&#8208;like bottlebrush copolymer, which can directly self&#8208;assemble into core&#8211;shell nanodiscs in an aqueous environment. As the bottlebrush side chains are made of amorphous, UV&#8208;responsive poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) chains, they can undergo rapid end&#8208;to&#8208;end self&#8208;immolation upon light irradiation. This triggered nanodisc disassembly can be used to boost small molecule release from the nanodisc core, which is further aided by a morphological change from discs to spheres.

         <title>Inside Cover: Dipole Coupling Accelerated H2O Dissociation by Magnesium&#8208;Based Intermetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipole coupling between catalysts and H2O molecules is utilized to control H2O adsorption and dissociation processes. In their Research Article (e202400119), Yangfan Lu, Qian Li, Fusheng Pan et&#8197;al. showed that the catalyst's dipole moment can be adjusted by modifying the electronegativity gap of utilized elements and realized a systematic control of H2O activation processes. These discoveries offer a catalyst design guideline for the H2O&#8208;associated reactions in addition to the widely cited d&#8208;band center concept.

The nature of adsorbed oxygen species determines the product selectivity in the oxidative coupling of CH4 as shown on the cover. In their Communication (e202319192), Guiyuan Jiang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko et&#8197;al. describe how the formation of carbon oxides and ethane correlates with the binding strength of selective mono&#8208;atomic oxygen species. The strength affects the probability of their recombination to diatomic oxygen species oxidizing methane to carbon oxides. Cover image credit: Vita A. Kondratenko.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes CircularlyPolarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of molecular vibrations on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in double helicenes DPC and DNH is reported by Tadashi Mori in a Research Article (e202319702). Specifically, in DPC (structure depicted in the picture), the study clarifies how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, and it underscores the noteworthy contribution of Herzberg&#8211;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.

         <title>Stabilization of Acenes: &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221;&#8208;Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;step synthesis, starting from commercially available pentacenetetraone, gives helical, doubly quaterphenylene wrapped pentacenes. The &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; architecture effectively shields the acene backbones&#8212;the para&#8208;quaterphenylene derivative displays unique stability with respect to photoxodiation and Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with PTAD or fullerene.







Abstract
We report soluble tetrakis&#8208;biphenylyl substituted pentacenes comprised of sp2 carbons and synthesized from pentacene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone. Intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss&#8208;cross&#8208;bridged pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions and are much less reactive than TIPS&#8208;ethynylated pentacene. Extension of this concept might provide access to the larger acenes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the novel metallic heterostructure Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co was prepared and exhibited excellent water splitting performance. This metallic heterostructure enhances the electron transport efficiency and accelerates the reaction rate of water molecules on its surface by optimizing the electronic structure of the heterointerface.







Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis holds promise for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, yet it encounters challenges like high voltage and limited stability at higher current densities, primarily due to inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt&#8208;based metallic heterostructure (Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co) is designed for excellent water electrolysis. In operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, increasing the available protons for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of the Co3Mo3N/Co4N heterointerface optimizes &#916;GH of the nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby enhancing the overall HER performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH&#8722; adsorption rate, coupled with great adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction accelerates electron transport, expediting the afore&#8208;mentioned reaction steps and enhancing water splitting efficiency. The Co3Mo3N/Co4N/Co electrocatalyst in the water electrolyzer delivers excellent performance, with a low 1.58&#8197;V cell voltage at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and maintains 100&#8201;% retention over 100&#8197;hours at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer.

         <title>Bifunctional Potential Structure Design Breaks Electrolyte Limitations of Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are safe and economical for grid applications. However, current ZIBs have limitations in terms of inferior capacity and low output voltage, which are hampered by the electrolyte applicability of the Zn2+ hosts. In this study, we propose a novel organic cathode design strategy with a bifunctional potential region. This polymeric Zn2+ host combines the conjugated polyaniline backbone to tune the molecular surface pH and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8208;/4 redox couple for high output voltage and capacity. The polyaniline doped with ferricyanide (PAF) electrode exhibits two forms of charge storage in ZIBs: proton&#8208;assisted Zn2+ doping below 1.2 V (mechanism I), and [Fe(CN)6]3&#8208;/4&#8208; redox pair above 1.8 V (mechanism II). Density functional theory calculations and in situ pH experiments demonstrated that the H+ doping process of mechanism I forms a localized pH regulation on the molecular chain surface, providing a favorable reaction environment for mechanism II. The Zn&#8208;polymer battery delivered an outstanding discharge capacity (405.2 mAh g&#8208;1) and high output voltage (1.8 V) in the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. This study provides a new route for enhancing the structural stability of electrodes and overcoming the electrolyte limitations of ferricyanide in weakly acidic electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonyl Molecules Induced Oriented Lithium Deposition for Long&#8208;Term Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During Li+ desolvation, the electrochemical binding ability of TSOH regulates Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. The electron&#8208;rich structure brings lower reduction potential energy and inhibits decomposition of Li salts. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, a &#8216;smooth and dense&#8217; SEI, significantly reducing interface transmission resistance of Li+ ions.







Abstract
Dendrites growth and unstable interfacial Li+ transport hinder the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we report an active layer of 2,4,6&#8211;trihydroxy benzene sulfonyl fluorine on copper substrate that induces oriented Li+ deposition and generates highly crystalline solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to achieve high&#8208;performance LMBs. The lithiophilic &#8722;SO2&#8722; groups of highly crystalline SEI accept the rapidly transported Li+ ions and form a dense inner layer of LiF and Li3N, which regulate Li+ plating morphology along the (110) crystal surface toward dendrite&#8208;free Li anode. Thus, Li||Cu cells with lithiophilic SEI achieve an average deposition efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% after 700&#8197;cycles, and Li||Li cells operate well for 1100&#8197;h. Besides, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with modified SEI exhibit a capacity retention that is 14&#8197;times than that of conventional SEI. Even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, Li||Cu cells reach stable deposition efficiency of 83.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

Abstract
In dinitrogen (N2) fixation chemistry, bimetallic end&#8208;on bridging N2 complexes M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M can split N2 into terminal nitrides and hence attract great attention. To date, only 4d and 5d transition complexes, but none of 3d counterparts, could realize such a transformation. Likewise, complexes {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2)}0/1+/2+ (1&#8211;3) are incapable to cleave N2, in contrast to their Mo congeners. Remarkably, cross this series the N&#8722;N bond length of the N2 ligand and the N&#8722;N stretching frequency exhibit unprecedented nonmonotonic variations, and complexes 1 and 2 in both solid and solution states display rare thermally activated ligand&#8208;mediated two&#8208;center spin transitions, distinct from discrete dinuclear spin crossovers. In&#8208;depth analyses using wave function based ab initio calculations reveal that the Cr&#8208;N2&#8208;Cr bonding in complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is distinguished by strong multireference character and cannot be described by solely one electron configuration or Lewis structure, and that all intriguing spectroscopic observations originate in their sophisticate multireference electronic structures. More critical is that such multireference bonding of complexes&#8197;1&#8211;3 is at least a key factor that contributes to their kinetic inertness toward N2 splitting. The mechanistic understanding is then used to rationalize the disparate reactivity of related 3d M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;N2)M complexes compared to their 4d and 5d analogs.

         <title>Discovering Electrochemistry with an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) embeds chemistry prior knowledge including the Bulter&#8208;Volmer, Nernst and Diffusion equation to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameter simultaneously from sparse experiments. ECINN seamlessly integrates mass transport and BV equation and provides arguably the best Tafel analysis method. This work encourages embedding domain knowledge to realize strong intelligence with sparse data.







Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly integrated into chemistry research by guiding experimental procedures, correlating structure and function, interpreting large experimental datasets, to distill scientific insights that might be challenging with traditional methods. Such applications, however, largely focus on gaining insights via big data and/or big computation, while neglecting the valuable chemical prior knowledge dwelling in chemists&#8217; minds. In this paper, we introduce an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) by explicitly embedding electrochemistry priors including the Butler&#8211;Volmer (BV), Nernst and diffusion equations on the backbone of neural networks for multi&#8208;task discovery of electrochemistry parameters. We applied the ECINN to voltammetry experiments of 
 and 
redox couples to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameters. Notably, ECINN seamlessly integrated mass transport with BV to analyze the entire voltammogram to infer transfer coefficients directly, so offering a new approach to Tafel analysis by outdating various mass transport correction methods. In addition, ECINN can help discover the nature of electron transfer and is shown to refute incorrect physics if imposed. This work encourages chemists to embed their domain knowledge into machine learning models to start a new paradigm of chemistry&#8208;informed machine learning for better accountability, interpretability, and generalization.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Regulated Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species from Porphyrin&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metallacage exhibited strong host&#8208;guest interactions with fullerene derivatives. The complexes could be dissembled by the further addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine to form a more stable coordinated complex. This tunable host&#8208;guest complexation was further employed to generate different types of reactive oxygen species, enabling the highly efficient and selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols.







Abstract
The development of novel materials for highly efficient and selective photocatalysis is crucial for their practical applications. Herein, we employ the host&#8208;guest chemistry of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species and further use them for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols. Upon irradiation, the sole metallacage (6) can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) effectively via excited energy transfer, while its complex with C70 (6&#8835;C70) opens a pathway for electron transfer to promote the formation of superoxide anion (O2&#8901;&#8722;), producing both 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. The addition of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (BPY) to complex 6&#8835;C70 forms a more stable complex (6&#8835;BPY) via the coordination of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin faces of 6 and BPY, which drives fullerenes out of the cavities and restores the ability of 1O2 generation. Therefore, benzyl alcohols are oxidized into benzyl aldehydes upon irradiation in the presence of 6 or 6&#8835;BPY, while they are oxidized into benzoic acids when 6&#8835;C70 is employed as the photosensitizing agent. This study demonstrates a highly efficient strategy that utilizes the host&#8208;guest chemistry of metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species for selective photooxidation reactions, which could promote the utilization of metallacages and their related host&#8208;guest complexes for photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Staggered Assembly of a Dimeric Au13 Cluster: Impacts on Coupling of Geometric Isomerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first completely staggered configuration of a di&#8208;superatomic Au25 cluster was solved with atomic precision. The significant torsion angle induces changes in electron coupling and complicates the relaxation pathway of electrons in the excited state when compared with the parallel eclipsed configuration.







Abstract
The specific states of aggregation of metal atoms in sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized gold clusters are related to the different quantum confinement volumes of electrons, leading to novel optical and electronic properties. These volumes can be tuned by changing the relative positions of the gold atoms to generate isomers. Studying the isomeric gold core and the electron coupling between the basic units is fundamentally important for nanoelectronic devices and luminescence; however, appropriate cases are lacking. In this study, the structure of the first staggered di&#8208;superatomic Au25&#8208;S was solved using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The optical properties of Au25&#8208;S were studied by comparing with eclipsed Au25&#8208;E. From Au25&#8208;E to Au25&#8208;S, changes in the electronic structures occurred, resulting in significantly different optical absorptions originating from the coupling between the two Au13 modules. Au25&#8208;S shows a longer electron decay lifetime of 307.7&#8197;ps before populating the lowest triplet emissive state, compared to 1.29&#8197;ps for Au25&#8208;E. The experimental and theoretical results show that variations in the geometric isomerism lead to distinct photophysical processes owing to isomerism&#8208;dependent electronic coupling. This study offers new insights into the connection between the geometric isomerism of nanosized building blocks and the optical properties of their assemblies, opening new possibilities for constructing function&#8208;specific nanomaterials.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Covalent Organic Framework in the Presence of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;containing&#8208;species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2 was proposed. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from the oxygen reduction reaction could decrease the energy barrier for the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center and thus boost the CO2RR performance.







Abstract
Herein, we propose an oxygen&#8208;containing species coordination strategy to boost CO2 electroreduction in the presence of O2. A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF), denoted as NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that is composed of the Ni&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) unit with well&#8208;defined Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites and the salen(Co)2 moiety with binuclear Co&#8722;N2O2 sites, is developed and synthesized for enhancing the CO2RR under aerobic condition. In the presence of O2, one of the Co sites in the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF that coordinated with the intermediate of *OOH from ORR could decrease the energy barrier of the activation of CO2 molecules and stabilize the key intermediate *COOH of the CO2RR over the adjacent Co center. Besides, the oxygen species axially coordinated Ni&#8722;N4&#8722;O sites can favor in reducing the energy barrier of the intermediate *COOH formation for the CO2RR. Thus, NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF exhibits high oxygen&#8208;tolerant CO2RR performance and achieves outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO partial current density of 40.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V in the presence of 0.5&#8201;% O2, which is superior to that in pure CO2 feed gas (FECO=94.8&#8201;%, jCO=19.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Notably, the NiPc&#8208;Salen(Co)2&#8208;COF achieves an industrial&#8208;level current density of 128.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow&#8208;cell reactor with 0.5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V, which is higher than that in pure CO2 atmosphere (jCO=104.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). It is worth noting that an excellent FECO of 86.8&#8201;% is still achieved in the presence of 5&#8201;% O2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V. This work provides an effective strategy to enable the CO2RR under O2 atmosphere by utilizing the *OOH intermediates of ORR to boost CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Build a High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Introducing Competitive Coordination Induction Effect in Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;inorganic composite electrolytes (PICE) have attracted tremendous attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) due to facile processability. However, the poor Li+ conductivity at room temperature (RT) and interfacial instability severely hamper the practical application.  Herein, we propose a concept of competitive coordination induction effects (CCIE) and reveal the essential correlation between the local coordination structure and the interfacial chemistry in PEO&#8208;based PICE. CCIE introduction greatly enhances the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performances of ASSLBs at 30&#176;C. Owing to the competitive coordination (Cs+&#8230;TFSI&#8722;&#8230;Li+, Cs+&#8230;C&#8208;O&#8208;C&#8230;Li+ and 2,4,6&#8208;TFA&#8230;Li&#8230;TFSI&#8722;) from the competitive cation (Cs+ from CsPF6) and molecule (2,4,6&#8208;TFA: 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoroaniline), a multimodal weak coordination environment of Li+ is constructed enabling a high efficient Li+ migration at 30oC (Li+ conductivity: 6.25&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1; tLi+ = 0.61). Since Cs+ tends to be enriched at the interface, TFSI&#8722; and PF6&#8722;in&#8208;situ form LiF&#8208;Li3N&#8208;Li2O&#8208;Li2S enriched solid electrolyte interface with electrostatic shielding effects. The assembled ASSLBs without adding interfacial wetting agent exhibit outstanding rate capability (LiFePO4: 147.44mAh g&#8722;1@1C and 107.41mAhg&#8722;1@2C) and cycling stability at 30oC (LiFePO4:94.65%@200cycles@0.5C; LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2: 94.31%@200cycles@0.3C). This work proposes a concept of CCIE and reveals its mechanism in designing PICE with high ionic conductivity as well as high interfacial compatibility at near RT for high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Orienting Group Directed Cascade Borylation for Efficient One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as Narrowband Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have emerged as very promising emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrowband emission spectra that may find application in high&#8208;definition displays. While considerable research has focused on investigating the properties of these materials, less attention has been placed on their synthetic methodology. Here we developed an efficient synthetic method for 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs, which enables sustainable production of narrowband organic emitting materials. By strategically introducing substituents, such as methyl, tert&#8208;butyl, phenyl, and chloride, at the C5 position of the 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine substrates, we achieved remarkable regioselective borylation in the para&#8208;position of the substituted moiety. This approach facilitated the synthesis of a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;BN&#8208;doped PAHs emitters with good yields and exceptional regioselectivity. The synthetic method demonstrated excellent scalability for large&#8208;scale production and enabled late&#8208;stage transformation of the borylated products. Mechanistic investigations provided valuable insights into the pivotal roles of electron effect and steric hindrance effect in achieving highly efficient regioselective borylation. Moreover, the outstanding device performance of the synthesized compounds 10b and 6z, underscores the practicality and significance of the developed method.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic and Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls via a Cyclic Iodonium Ylide Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, it remains challenging to achieve a general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, particularly ubiquitous heteroaromatic ones. In most cases, the preparation of their medically significant arylated derivatives requires multistep synthetic sequences. Herein, we introduce a new, convenient strategy involving the conversion of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to cyclic iodonium ylides (CIYs), followed by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation with arylboronic reagents via carbene coupling. This approach is mild, operationally simple, base&#8208;free, biocompatible, and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt; 100 examples), especially with respect to various heteroaromatic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and ortho&#8208;substituted or base&#8208;sensitive arylboronic acids. Importantly, owing to the excellent compatibility with various arylboronic acids or boronate esters (ArBpin, ArBneop, or ArBF3K), this method allows the late&#8208;stage installation of heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs in highly complex settings. The utility of this transformation is further demonstrated through significantly simplifying the synthesis of several bioactive molecules and natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Inorganic Dimensionality of Ultrastable Lead Halide Coordination Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide hybrids have shown great potentials in CO2 photoreduction, but challenging to afford C2+ reduced products, especially using H2O as the reductant. This is largely due to the trade&#8208;off problem between instability of the benchmark 3D structures and low carrier mobility of quasi&#8208;2D analogues. Herein, the lead halide dimensionality of robust coordination polymers (CP) was modulated by organic ligands differing in a single&#8208;atom change (NH vs. CH2), in which the NH groups coordinate with interlamellar [PbI2] clusters to achieve the important 2D&#8594;3D transition. This first CP based on 3D cationic lead iodide sublattice possesses both high aqueous stability and a low exciton binding energy of 25 meV that is on the level of ambient thermal energy, achieving artificial photosynthesis of C2H5OH. Photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations suggest the bridging [PbI2] clusters in the 3D structure not only results in enhanced carrier transport, but also promotes the intrinsic charge polarization to facilitate the C&#8211;C coupling. With trace loading of Rh cocatalyst, the apparent quantum efficiency of the 3D CP reaches 1.4% at 400 nm with a high C2H5OH selectivity of 89.4% (product basis), which presents one of the best photocatalysts for C2 products to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Two&#8208;Dimensional Defective Bi Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst surface dynamics drive the generation of active species for electrocatalytic reactions. Yet, the understanding of dominant site formation and reaction mechanisms is limited. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic reconstruction of two&#8208;dimensional defective Bi nanosheets from exfoliated Bi2Se3 nanosheets under electrochemical CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8208;) reduction conditions. The ultrathin Bi2Se3 nanosheets obtained by NaBH4&#8208;assisted cryo&#8208;mediated liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation are more easily reduced and reconstructed to Bi nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries (GBs; GB&#8208;rich Bi). The reconstructed GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst affords a remarkable yield rate of 4.6 mmol h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and Faradaic efficiency of 32% for urea production at &#8722;0.40 V vs. RHE. Notably, this yield rate is 2 and 8.2 times higher than those of the low&#8208;GB Bi and bulk Bi catalysts, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the GB sites significantly reduce the *CO and *NH2 intermediate formation energy and C&#8208;N coupling energy barrier, enabling selective urea electrosynthesis on the GB&#8208;rich Bi catalyst. This work will trigger further research into the structure&#8211;activity interplay in dynamic processes using in situ techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc ion Batteries: Bridging the Gap from Academia to Industry for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) exhibit significant promise in the next generation of grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their safety, relatively high volumetric energy density, and low production cost. Despite substantial advancements in ZIBs, a comprehensive evaluation of critical parameters impacting their practical energy density (Epractical) and calendar life is lacking. Hence, we suggest using formulation&#8208;based study as a scientific tool to accurately calculate the cell&#8208;level energy density and predict the cycling life of ZIBs. By combining all key battery parameters, such as the capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode (N/P), into one formula, we assess their impact on Epractical. When all parameters are optimized, we urge to achieve the theoretical capacity for a high Epractical. Furthermore, we propose a formulation that correlates the N/P and Coulombic efficiency of ZIBs for predicting their calendar life. Finally, we offer a comprehensive overview of current advancements in ZIBs, covering cathode and anode, along with practical evaluations. This Minireview outlines specific goals, suggests future research directions, and sketches prospects for designing efficient and high&#8208;performing ZIBs. It aims at bridging the gap from academia to industry for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Supramolecular Polymers for Recyclable Photobiocatalytic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modifications of enzymes excel in the realm of enzyme engineering due to its directness, robustness, and efficiency; however, challenges persist in devising versatile and effective strategies.&#160; In this study, we introduce a supramolecular modification methodology that amalgamates a supramolecular polymer with Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB) to create supramolecular enzymes (SupEnzyme). This approach features the straightforward preparation of a supramolecular amphiphilic polymer (&#946;&#8208;CD@SMA), which was subsequently conjugated to the enzyme, resulting in a SupEnzyme capable of self&#8208;assembly into supramolecular nanoparticles. The resulting SupEnzyme nanoparticles can form micron&#8208;scale supramolecular aggregates via supramolecular and electrostatic interactions with guest entities, thus enhancing catalyst recycling. Remarkably, these aggregates maintain 80% activity after seven cycles, outperforming Novozym 435. Additionally, they can effectively initiate photobiocatalytic cascade reactions using guest photocatalysts. As a consequence, our SupEnzyme methodology exhibits noteworthy adaptability in enzyme modification, presenting a versatile platform for various polymer, enzyme, and biocompatible catalyst pairings, with potential applications in the fields of chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Lattice Modulation Enables Stable Cycling of High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Batteries at High Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide solid electrolytes, known for their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good oxidative stability, face notable challenges in all&#8722;solid&#8722;state Li&#8722;ion batteries (ASSBs), especially with unstable cathode/solid electrolyte (SE) interface and increasing interfacial resistance during cycling. In this work, we have developed an Al3+&#8722;doped, cation&#8722;disordered epitaxial nanolayer on the LiCoO2 surface by reacting it with an artificially constructed AlPO4 nanoshell; this lithium&#8722;deficient layer featuring a rock&#8722;salt&#8722;like phase effectively suppresses oxidative decomposition of Li3InCl6 electrolyte and stabilizes the cathode/SE interface at 4.5 V. The ASSBs with the halide electrolyte Li3InCl6 and a high&#8722;loading LiCoO2 cathode demonstrated high discharge capacity and long cycling life from 3 to 4.5 V. Our findings emphasize the importance of specialized cathode surface modification in preventing SE degradation and achieving stable cycling of halide&#8722;based ASSBs at high voltages.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimeric Giant Molecule Acceptors Featuring N&#8208;type Linker: Enhancing Intramolecular Coupling for High&#8208;Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) are typically designed through the conjugated linking of individual small molecule acceptors (SMAs). This design imparts an extended molecular size, elevating the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to their SMA counterparts. Consequently, it effectively suppresses the thermodynamic relaxation of the acceptor component when blended with polymer donors to construct stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Different from previous reports utilizing&#160;p&#8208;type linkers, here, we explore an&#160;n&#8208;type linker, to dimerize the SMA units via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation, affording&#160;BT&#8208;DL. In comparison with&#160;B&#8208;DL&#160;with a benzene linkage,&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;exhibits significantly stronger intermolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling, a desirable property for the acceptor component. Furthermore,&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;demonstrates a higher film absorption coefficient, redshifted absorption, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;translate into a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.49% in PSCs, a substantial improvement over the 9.17% efficiency observed in corresponding devices with&#160;B&#8208;DL&#160;as the acceptor. Notably, the&#160;BT&#8208;DL&#160;based device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 90% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1000 hours of thermal stress at 90 &#176;C. This work highlight their potential advantage of n&#8208;type linker&#8208;dimerized GMAs in enhancing intermolecular coupling for more efficient and durable devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effects on Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binding water molecules to polar sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is inevitable, but the corresponding solvent effects in electrocatalytic process have been largely overlooked. Herein, we investigate the solvent effects on COFs for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our designed COFs incorporated different kinds of nitrogen atoms (imine N, pyridine N, and phenazine N), enabling tunable interactions with water molecules. These interactions play a crucial role in modulating electronic states and altering the catalytic centers within the COFs. Among the synthesized COFs, the one with pyridine N atoms exhibits the highest activity, with characterized by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 V and a mass activity of 0.32 A mg&#8211;1, which surpass those from other metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the stronger binding ability of *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridine N sites. This work sheds light on the significance of considering solvent effects on COFs in electrocatalytic systems, providing valuable insights into their design and optimization for improved performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Interfacial Active Gemini Surfactants as Simple and Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing, Lubricating and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, locking the shape of liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium states usually relies on jamming of nanoparticle surfactants at an oil/water interface. Here we show that a synthetic water&#8208;soluble zwitterionic Gemini surfactant can serve as an alternative to nanoparticle surfactants for stabilizing, structuring and additionally lubricating liquids. By yielding a high binding energy comparable to amphiphilic nanoparticles at the paraffin oil/water interface, the surfactant can attain near&#8208;zero interfacial tensions and ultrahigh surface coverages after spontaneous adsorption. Owing to the strong association between neighboring surfactant molecules, closely packed monolayers with high mechanical elasticity can be generated at the oil/water interface, thus allowing the surfactant to produce not only ultra&#8208;stable emulsions but also structured liquids with various geometries using extrusion printing and 3D printing techniques. By undergoing tribochemical reactions at its sulfonic termination, the surfactant can endow resultant emulsions favorable lubricity even under high load&#8208;bearing conditions. Our study may provide new insights into creating complex liquid devices and new&#8208;generation lubricants capable of combining the characteristics of both liquid and solid lubricants.</dc:description>

         <title>Second Generation Catalytic Enantioselective Nucleophilic Desymmetrization at P(V): Improved Generality, Efficiency and Modularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A broadly improved second generation catalytic two&#8208;phase strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral at phosphorus (V) compounds is described. This protocol, consisting of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalyzed nucleophilic desymmetrization of prochiral, bench stable P(V) precursors and subsequent enantiospecific substitution allows for divergent access to a wide range of C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208; substituted P(V) containing compounds from a handful of enantioenriched precursors.

         <title>Tethered Trimeric Small&#8208;molecular Acceptors through Aromatic&#8208;core engineering for Highly Efficient and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, meta&#8208;isomerization was conducted on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core to precisely regulate the geometry of tethered dimeric acceptors, revealing a more advantageous molecular packing for the meta&#8208;positioned dimers. This finding led to the design of a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned trimer, demonstrating enhanced device stability and performance.







Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. To tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein multiple SMA&#8208;subunits are connected to the aromatic&#8208;core via flexible chains, are proposed. This design aims to an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) for a dynamical control. However, attaining an elevated Tg value with additional SMA subunits introduces complexity to the molecular packing, posing a significant challenge in realizing both high stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core and find that meta&#8208;positioned dimeric BDY&#8208;&#946; exhibits more favorable molecular packing compared to its para&#8208;positioned counterpart, BDY&#8208;&#945;. With this encouraging result, we expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY&#8208;&#946;, maintaining a meta&#8208;position relative to each SMA unit location in the tethered acceptor. This systematic aromatic&#8208;core engineering results in a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24&#8201;%, coupled with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the trimer&#8208;based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability with over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1200&#8197;h thermal degradation. Our findings underscore the promise and feasibility of tethered trimeric structures in achieving highly ordered aggregation behavior and increased Tg value in PSCs, simultaneously improving in device efficiency and thermal stability.

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500&#8197;Wh/kg</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Fe(CN)6] vacancies regulation is proposed to achieve high specific capacity of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). And then a novel precipitation conversion synthesis method was designed. The as&#8208;prepared PBAs with hierarchical hollow morphology and [Fe(CN)6] vacancies have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh energy density.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 25&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).

         <title>&#8220;Turbo&#8208;Charged&#8221; DNA Motors with Optimized Sequence Enable Single&#8208;Molecule Nucleic Acid Sensing</title>

Programmable DNA motors with tunable properties. The 0&#8201;% GC is the fastest motor and can detect and stall in the presence of single oligonucleotides.







Abstract
DNA motors that consume chemical energy to generate processive mechanical motion mimic natural motor proteins and have garnered interest due to their potential applications in dynamic nanotechnology, biosensing, and drug delivery. Such motors translocate by a catalytic cycle of binding, cleavage, and rebinding between DNA &#8220;legs&#8221; on the motor body and RNA &#8220;footholds&#8221; on a track. Herein, we address the well&#8208;documented trade&#8208;off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg&#8208;foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0&#8201;% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150&#8197;nm/sec, three&#8208;fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0&#8201;% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single&#8208;molecule sensitivity when programming the motors to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high&#8208;performance DNA motors with promising real&#8208;world biosensing applications.

Herein, we address the well-documented trade-off between motor speed and processivity and investigate how these parameters are controlled by the affinity between DNA legs and their complementary footholds. Specifically, we explore the role of DNA leg length and GC content in tuning motor performance by dictating the rate of leg-foothold dissociation. Our investigations reveal that motors with 0&#8201;% GC content exhibit increased instantaneous velocities of up to 150&#8197;nm/sec, three-fold greater than previously reported DNA motors and comparable to the speeds of biological motor proteins. We also demonstrate that the faster speed and weaker forces generated by 0&#8201;% GC motors can be leveraged for enhanced capabilities in sensing. We observe single-molecule sensitivity when programming the motors to stall in response to the binding of nucleic acid targets. These findings offer insights for the design of high-performance DNA motors with promising real-world biosensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Aminotetralins via [4+2] Annulation of Aldimines with Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation has been achieved for the first time by the use of half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts with different metals, providing an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of the multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily available aldimines and alkenes.







Abstract
The search for efficient and selective methods for the divergent synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted aminotetralins is of much interest and importance. We report herein for the first time the diastereoselective [4+2] annulation of 2&#8208;methyl aromatic aldimines with alkenes via benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts, which constitutes an efficient route for the divergent synthesis of both trans and cis diastereoisomers of multi&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminotetralin derivatives from readily accessible aldimines and alkenes. The use of a scandium catalyst bearing a sterically demanding cyclopentadienyl ligand such as C5Me4SiMe3 or C5Me5 exclusively afforded the trans&#8208;selective annulation products in the reaction of aldimines with styrenes and aliphatic alkenes. In contrast, the analogous yttrium catalyst, whose metal ion size is larger than that of scandium, yielded the cis&#8208;selective annulation products. This protocol features 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency, excellent diastereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group compatibility. The reaction mechanisms have been elucidated by kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments and the isolation and transformations of some key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt in Molecular Catalysts via Coordination Environment Regulation for Highly Efficient Heterogeneous Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic molecular catalysts with different coordination environments were synthesized to enhance electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) for efficient ammonia (NH3) production. The best catalyst with N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration exhibited superior activity, achieving over 94&#8201;% NH3 Faradaic efficiency. The research highlights the impact of coordinating subunits on the electronic structures and activity towards eNO3RR and establishes a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is pivotal in modern industry and represents a promising next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy carrier. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) presents viable solutions for NH3 production and removal of ambient nitrate pollutants. However, the development of eNO3RR is hindered by lacking the efficient electrocatalysts. To address this challenge, we synthesized a series of macrocyclic molecular catalysts for the heterogeneous eNO3RR. These materials possess different coordination environments around metal centers by surrounding subunits. Consequently, electronic structures of the active centers can be altered, enabling tunable activity towards eNO3RR. Our investigation reveals that metal center with an N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration demonstrates superior activity over the others and achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90&#8201;% within the tested range, where the highest FE of approximately 94&#8201;% is obtained. Furthermore, it achieves a production rate of 11.28&#8197;mg&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a turnover frequency of up to 3.28&#8197;s&#8722;1. Further tests disclose that these molecular catalysts with diverse coordination environments showed different magnetic moments. Theoretical calculation results indicate that variated coordination environments can result in a d&#8208;band center variation which eventually affects rate&#8208;determining step energy and calculated magnetic moments, thus establishing a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Hetero[9]helicene Toward Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic helical p&#8208;conjugated skeleton makes helicenes highly promising for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). Generally, carbon helicenes undergo low external quantum efficiency (EQE), while the incorporation of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) BN structure has achieved an improvement. However, the reported B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes all show low electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) typically hovering around 1 &#215; 10&#8208;3. Therefore, the development of B,N&#8208;embedded helicenes with both high EQE and gEL value is crucial for achieving highly efficiency CPEL. Herein, a facile approach to synthesize B,N&#8208;embedded hetero[9]helicenes, BN[9]H, is presented. BN[9]H shows a bright photoluminescence peaking at 578 nm with high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 5.8 &#215; 10&#8208;3, attributed to its inherited MR&#8208;TADF property and intrinsic helical skeleton. Furthermore, circularly polarized OLED devices incorporating BN[9]H as emitter show maximum EQE of 35.5%, a small full width at half&#8208;maximum of 48 nm, and more importantly, a high |gEL| of 6.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3. The Q&#8208;factor (|EQE &#215; gEL|) of CP&#8208;OLEDs is determined to be 2.2 &#215; 10&#8208;3, which is the highest among helicene analogues. This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.</dc:description>

This work provides a new approach for the synthesis of higher helicenes and paves a new way for the construction of highly efficient CPEL materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrastable Supramolecular Framework Based on Consecutive Side&#8208;by&#8208;Side Hydrogen Bonds for One&#8208;Step C2H4 / C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;step efficient separation of high&#8208;purity C2H4 from C2H4 / C2H6 mixtures by HOFs faces two problems: lack of strategies for constructing stable pores in HOFs and how to obtain high C2H6 selectivity. Herein, we have developed a microporous Mortise&#8208;Tenon&#8208;type HOF (MTHOF&#8208;1, MT is short for Mortise&#8208;Tenon structure) with a new self&#8208;assembly mode for C2H4 / C2H6 separation. Unlike previous HOFs which usually possess discrete head&#8208;to&#8208;head hydrogen bonds, MTHOF&#8208;1 is assembled by a unique consecutive side&#8208;by&#8208;side hydrogen bonds, which result in mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon pores decorated with orderly arranged amide groups and benzene rings. As expected, MTHOF&#8208;1 exhibits excellent stability under various conditions and shows obvious separation trends for C2H6 / C2H4. The IAST selectivity is as high as 2.15 at 298 K. More importantly, dynamic breakthrough experiments have demonstrated that MTHOF&#8208;1 can effectively separate the C2H6 / C2H4 feed gas to obtain polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 in one step even under high&#8208;humidity conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;mediated Interfacial Growth of 2D&#8208;2D Heterostructured Nanomaterials as Cathodes for Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce a novel approach for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene heterostructures featuring a sandwiched and cross&#8208;linked network structure. This method addresses the common issue of activity degradation in 2D nanomaterials caused by inevitable aggregation. By utilizing the distinct surface characteristics of MXene, we successfully induced the growth of various 2D nanomaterials on MXene substrates. This strategy effectively mitigates self&#8208;stacking defects and augments the exposure of surface areas. In particular, the obtained 2D&#8208;2D MXene@NiCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MH&#8208;NiCo) heterostructures exhibit enhanced structural stability, improved chemical reversibility, and heightened charge transfer efficiency, outperforming pure NiCo LDH. The aqueous MH&#8208;Ni4Co1//Zn@carbon cloth (MH&#8208;Ni4Co1//Zn@CC) battery demonstrates exceptional performance with a remarkable specific capacity of 0.61 mAh cm&#8722;2, maintaining 96.6% capacitance after 2300 cycles. Additionally, it achieves an energy density of 1.047 mWh cm&#8722;2 and a power density of 32.899 mW cm&#8722;2. This research not only paves the way for new design paradigms in energy&#8208;related nanomaterials but also offers invaluable insights for the application and optimization of 2D&#8208;2D heterostructures in advanced electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Heterometal&#8208;Organic Capsules for Selectively Encapsulating Tetrahedral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthetic modification plays a crucial role in precisely adjusting the structure and functions of advanced materials. Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of a tubular heterometallic Pd3Cu6L16 capsule, incorporating Pd(II) and CuL1 metalloligands. This capsule undergoes further modification with two tridentate anionic ligands (L2) resulting in a bicapped Pd3Cu6L16L22 capsule with an Edshammer polyhedral structure. By employing transition metal ions, acid, and oxidation agents, the bicapped capsule is convertible to an uncapped one. This uncapped form can then revert to the bicapped structure with the addition of Br&#8208; ions and a base. Interestingly, introducing Ag+ leads to the removal of one L2 ligand from the bicapped capsule, yielding a mono&#8208;capped Pd3Cu6L16L2 structure. Furthermore, the size of anions critically influences the precisely controlling the post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the capsules. It was demonstrated that these capsules selectively encapsulate the tetrahedral anions, offering a novel approach in the design of intelligent molecular delivery systems.</dc:description>

In contrast, double 1,2&#8208;migration remains rare and limited to transition&#8208;metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of mixed heavier Sn=Ge vinylidenes. Double 1,2&#8208;carbon migration enables the isomerization of the stannagermenylidene (3) to the germastannenylidene (4). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations revealed that 3 and 4 feature a Sn=Ge double bond. The reaction of 3 with IMe2&#160;(1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) results in the electron redistribution in the Sn=Ge core to give the germylone&#8208;stannylene adduct (5).

         <title>Antenna Effect in Noble Metal&#8208;Free Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic Systems Enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems by utilizing noble metal&#8208;free photosensitizer (zinc&#8208;porphyrin) and catalyst (cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine) derivatives. Upon introducing an additional chromophore (Bodipy), an antenna effect enhanced the photoproduction leading to 42.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 of CO and 759 turn over numbers.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalytic systems (DSPs) have been extensively investigated for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution. However, their application in carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction remains limited. Furthermore, current solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs typically employ rhenium complexes as catalysts. In this study, we have developed DSPs that incorporate noble metal&#8208;free components, specifically a zinc&#8208;porphyrin as photosensitizer (PS) and a cobalt&#8208;quaterpyridine as catalyst (CAT). Taking a significant stride forward, we have achieved an antenna effect for the first time in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO DSPs by introducing a Bodipy as an additional chromophore to enhance light harvesting efficiency. The energy transfer from Bodipy to zinc porphyrin resulted in remarkable stability (turn over number (TON)=759 vs. CAT), and high CO evolution activity (42&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 vs. CAT).

         <title>A Polymeric Nanoparticle to Co&#8208;Deliver Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Peptides and Pt(IV) Prodrug: Toward High Loading Efficiency and Combination Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing combination chemotherapy systems with high drug loading efficiency at predetermined drug ratios to achieve a synergistic effect is important for cancer therapy. Herein, a polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria&#8208;targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. The depolymerization of polymeric dual&#8208;drug nanoparticle and the activation of Pt prodrug can be effectively triggered by the acidic tumor environment extracellularly and the high levels of glutathione intracellularly in cancer cells, respectively. The utilization of mitochondria&#8208;targeting peptide can inhibit ATP&#8208;dependent processes including drug efflux and DNA damage repair. This leads to increased accumulation of Pt&#8208;drugs within cancer cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing combination chemotherapy systems with high drug loading efficiency at predetermined drug ratios to achieve a synergistic effect is important for cancer therapy. Herein, a polymeric dual-drug nanoparticle composed of a Pt(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin and a mitochondria-targeting cytotoxic peptide is constructed through emulsion interfacial polymerization, which processes high drug loading efficiency and high biocompatibility. The depolymerization of polymeric dual-drug nanoparticle and the activation of Pt prodrug can be effectively triggered by the acidic tumor environment extracellularly and the high levels of glutathione intracellularly in cancer cells, respectively. The utilization of mitochondria-targeting peptide can inhibit ATP-dependent processes including drug efflux and DNA damage repair. This leads to increased accumulation of Pt-drugs within cancer cells. Eventually, the polymeric dual-drug nanoparticle demonstrates appreciable antitumor effects on both cell line derived and patient derived xenograft lung cancer model. It is highly anticipated that the polymeric dual-or multi-drug systems can be applied for combination chemotherapy to achieve enhanced anticancer activity and reduced side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uncovering Photoelectronic and Photothermal Effects in Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work quantitatively disentangles the photoelectronic (PE) and photothermal (PT) effects in plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis using CO2RR on Ag NPs electrode as the model system. The PE effect prevails over a wide potential window for the CO2RR to CO, while the PT effect dominates the H2 evolution reaction at high overpotentials. It is revealed spectroscopically that the carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate applies to the plasmon&#8208;promoted CO2RR to CO process.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis that rests on the ability of coupling localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and electrochemical activation, emerges as an intriguing and booming area. However, its development seriously suffers from the entanglement between the photoelectronic and photothermal effects induced by the decay of plasmons, especially under the influence of applied potential. Herein, using LSPR&#8208;mediated CO2 reduction on Ag electrocatalyst as a model system, we quantitatively uncover the dominant photoelectronic effect on CO2 reduction reaction over a wide potential window, in contrast to the leading photothermal effect on H2 evolution reaction at relatively negative potentials. The excitation of LSPR selectively enhances the CO faradaic efficiency (17&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE) and partial current density (100&#8208;fold at &#8722;0.6&#8197;VRHE), suppressing the undesired H2 faradaic efficiency. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) reveals a plasmon&#8208;promoted formation of the bridge&#8208;bonded CO on Ag surface via a carbonyl&#8208;containing C1 intermediate. The present work demonstrates a deep mechanistic understanding of selective regulation of interfacial reactions by coupling plasmons and electrochemistry.

         <title>Bimetallic Synergy Enables Silole Insertion into THF and the Synthesis of Erbium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potassium silole salt reacts with erbium or yttrium cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl half&#8208;sandwich complexdx via insertion of a silole silicon atom into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. Analogous reactions involving a potassium germole salt reveal intact transfer of the germole to the rare&#8208;earth element, giving germole&#8208;ligated coordination polymers. The erbium are single&#8208;molecule magnets, and one example is characterized using high&#8208;frequency AC susceptometry.







Abstract
The potassium silole K2[SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2] reacts with [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4] (M=Er, Y; COT=cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl) in THF to give products that feature unprecedented insertion of the nucleophilic silicon centre into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. The structure of the major product, [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K]&#8734; (1M), consists of polymeric chains of sandwich complexes, where the spiro&#8208;bicyclic silapyran ligand [C4H8OSiC4(SiMe3)2Ph2]2&#8722; (L1) coordinates to potassium via the oxygen. The minor product [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(&#956;&#8208;L1)K(THF)]2 (2M) features coordination of the silapyran to the rare&#8208;earth metal. In forming 1M and 2M, silole insertion into THF only occurs in the presence of potassium and the rare&#8208;earth metal, highlighting the importance of bimetallic synergy. The lower nucleophilicity of germanium(II) leads to contrasting reactivity of the potassium germole K2[GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2] towards [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4], with intact transfer of the germole occurring to give the coordination polymers [{&#951;5&#8208;GeC4(SiMe3)2Me2}M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)K]&#8734; (3M). Despite the differences in reactivity induced by the group 14 heteroatom, the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of 1Er, 2Er and 3Er are similar, with thermally activated relaxation occurring via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet, subject to effective energy barriers of 122, 80 and 91&#8197;cm&#8722;1, respectively. Compound 1Er is also analysed by high&#8208;frequency dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 106&#8197;Hz.

         <title>Selective Construction and Structural Transformation of Homogeneous Linear Metalla[4]catenane and Metalla[2]catenane Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane consisting of four linked rings was obtained in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear Cp*Rh&#8208;based precursor.







Abstract
Although the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules has been extensively researched, selectively constructing homogeneous linear [4]catenanes remains a formidable challenge. Here, we selectively constructed a homogeneous linear metalla[4]catenane in a one&#8208;step process through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligand and a binuclear half&#8208;sandwich rhodium precursor. The formation of metalla[4]catenanes was facilitated by cooperative interactions between strong sandwich&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds between the components. Moreover, by modulating the aromatic substituents on the binuclear precursor, two homogeneous metalla[2]catenanes were obtained. The molecular structures of these metallacatenanes were unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, reversible structural transformation between metal&#8208;catenanes and the corresponding metallarectangles could be achieved by altering their concentration, as confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy studies.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;mimetic Engineered Protein Fibers with High Toughness and Minimized Batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch Variations through &#946;&#8208;sheets Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spidroin&#8208;derived modular proteins have been designed and the fabricated fibers demonstrate a toughness of up to 200&#8197;MJ/m3, achieving the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. By co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets in the two structural proteins, the fibers&#8217; mechanical performance and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch stability have been improved significantly.







Abstract
Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin&#8208;mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C&#8208;terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;&#8208;sheets modules, and a non&#8208;spidroin random&#8208;coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200&#8197;MJ/m3, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability in the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high&#8208;performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.

By co-assembly of &#946;-sheets in the two structural proteins, the fibers&#8217; mechanical performance and batch-to-batch stability have been improved significantly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin-mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C-terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;-sheets modules, and a non-spidroin random-coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200&#8197;MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co-assembly of &#946;-sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch-to-batch variability in the dual-component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual-component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high-performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amperometry and Electron Microscopy show Stress Granules Induce Homotypic Fusion of Catecholamine Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An overreactive stress granule (SG) pathway and long&#8208;lived, stable SGs formation are thought to participate in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). To understand if and how SGs contribute to disorders of neurotransmitter release in NDs, we examined the interaction between extracellular isolated SGs and vesicles. Amperometry shows that the vesicular content increases and dynamics of vesicle opening slow down after vesicles are treated with SGs, suggesting larger vesicles are formed. Data from the transmission electron microscope (TEM) clearly shows that a portion of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) with double/multiple cores appear, thus confirming SGs induce homotypic fusion between LDCVs. This might be a protective step to help cells to survive following high oxidative stress. A hypothetical mechanism is proposed whereby enriched mRNA in the shell of SGs is likely to bind intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) regions of vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) driving a disrupted membrane between two closely buddled vesicles to fuse with each other to form double cored vesicles. Our results show that SGs induce homotypic fusion of LDCVs, providing better understanding of how SGs intervene in pathological processes opening new direction to SGs involved neurodegenerative disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding of Precursors to Replicator Assemblies Can Improve Replication Fidelity and Mediate Error Correction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copying information is vital for life's propagation. Current life forms maintain a low error rate in replication, using complex machinery to prevent and correct errors. However, primitive life had to deal with higher error rates, limiting its ability to evolve. Discovering mechanisms to reduce errors would alleviate this constraint. Here, we introduce a new mechanism that decreases error rates and corrects errors in synthetic self&#8208;replicating systems driven by self&#8208;assembly. Previous work showed that macrocycle replication occurs through the accumulation of precursor material on the sides of the fibrous replicator assemblies. Stochastic simulations now reveal that selective precursor binding to the fiber surface enhances replication fidelity and error correction. Centrifugation experiments show that replicator fibers can exhibit the necessary selectivity in precursor binding. Our results suggest that synthetic replicator systems are more evolvable than previously thought, encouraging further evolution&#8208;focused experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Identification and Discovery of an Elusive Polymorph of Drug&#8208;Polymer Inclusion Complex Using Automated 3D Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D electron diffraction (3D ED) has shown great potential in crystal structure determination in materials, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. In this work, an automated, low&#8208;dose and low&#8208;bias 3D ED protocol has been implemented to identify six phases from a multiple&#8208;phase melt&#8208;crystallisation product of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, griseofulvin (GSF). Batch data collection under low&#8208;dose conditions using a widely available commercial software was combined with automated data analysis to collect and process over 230 datasets in three days. Accurate unit cell paramters obtained from 3D ED data allowed direct phase identification of GSF Forms III, I and the known GSF inclusion complex (IC) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) (GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;I), as well as three minor phases, namely GSF Forms II, V and an elusive new phase, GSF&#8208;PEG IC&#8208;II. Their structures were then directly determined by 3D ED. Furthermore, we reveal how the stabilities of the two GSF&#8208;PEG IC polymorphs are closely related to their crystal structures. These results demonstrate the power of automated 3D ED for accurate phase identification and direct structure determination of complex, beam&#8208;sensitive crystallisation products, which is significant for drug development where solid form screening is crucial for the overall efficacy of the drug product.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphate Coordination to Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Secondary Building Units Prolongs Drug Retention for Synergistic Chemoradiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoradiotherapy combines radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy to potentiate antitumor activity but exacerbates toxicities and causes debilitating side effects in cancer patients. Herein, we report the use of a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) as a 2D nanoradiosensitizer and a reservoir for the slow release of chemotherapeutics to amplify the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Coordination of phosphate&#8208;containing drugs to MOL secondary building units prolongs their intratumoral retention, allowing for continuous release of gemcitabine monophosphate (GMP) for effective localized chemotherapy. In the meantime, the MOL sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray irradiation and provides potent radiotherapeutic effects. GMP&#8208;loaded MOL (GMP/MOL) enhances cytotoxicity by 2&#8208;fold and improves radiotherapeutic effects over free GMP in vitro. In a colon cancer model, GMP/MOL retains GMP in tumors for more than four days and, when combined with low&#8208;dose radiotherapy, inhibits tumor growth by 98%. The synergistic chemoradiotherapy enabled by GMP/MOL shows a cure rate of 50%, improves survival, and ameliorates cancer&#8208;proliferation histological biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sequential process via photoredox catalysis and Lewis acid mediation for C&#8211;F bond transformation of the CF2 unit in perfluoroalkyl groups has been achieved to transform perfluoroalkylarenes into complex fluoroalkylated compounds. A phenothiazine&#8208;based photocatalyst promotes the defluoroaminoxylation of perfluoroalkylarenes with (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) under visible light irradiation, affording the corresponding aminoxylated products. These products undergo a further defluorinative transformation with various organosilicon reagents mediated by AlCl3 to provide highly functionalized perfluoroalkyl alcohols. Our novel phenothiazine catalyst works efficiently in the defluoroaminoxylation. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the catalyst regeneration step is crucial for the photocatalytic aminoxylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Development of artificial ight&#8208;harvesting systems mimicking the natural photosynthesis process is an ever&#8208;growing field of research. Numerous systems such as polymers, metal complexes, POFs, COFs, supramolecular frameworks etc. have been fabricated to accomplish more efficient energy transfer and storage. Among them, the supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) formed by non&#8208;covalent metal&#8208;ligand interaction, have shown the capacity to not only undergo single and multistep energy migration but also to utilize the harvested energy for a wide variety of applications such as photocatalysis, tunable emissive systems, encrypted anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, white light emitters etc. This review sheds light on the light&#8208;harvesting behavior of both the 2D metallacycles and 3D metallacages where design ingenuity has been executed to afford energy harvesting by both donor ligands as well as metal acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetics Controlled Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization control of perovskite thin films is the key in commerciallization of perovskite solar cells. However, the fast crystallization of the thin film including nucleation, growth and Oswald ripening, is still a mystery though some efforts made. According to the theories of nucleation and Oswald ripening, we modified the perovskite surface energy and improved the grain solubility, and quantified the nucleation and ripening rate in experiments. These quantified parameters will facilitate the model building in perovskite crystallization for further industry production.Finally, the optimized films were applied in solar cells to improve efficiency from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;% with VOC of 1.175&#8197;V and FF of 83.53. Furthermore, the excellent ambient stability, light stability and thermal stability are obtained. This work paves the way for controls on overall crystallization kinetics of perovskite films, including nucleation, growth and ripening.







Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have recently developed rapidly compared to crystalline silicon solar cells. To have an effective way to control the crystallization of perovskite thin films is the key for achieving good device performance. However, a paradox in perovskite crystallization is from the mismatch between nucleation and Oswald ripening. Usually, the large numbers of nucleation sites tend to weak Oswald ripening. Here, we proposed a new mechanism to promote the formation of nucleation sites by reducing surface energy from 44.9&#8197;mN/m to 36.1&#8197;mN/m, to spontaneously accelerate the later Oswald ripening process by improving the grain solubility through the elastic modulus regulation. The ripening rate is increased from 2.37&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 to 4.61&#8197;&#197;m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 during annealing. Finally, the solar cells derived from the optimized films showed significantly improved PCE from 23.14&#8201;% to 25.32&#8201;%. The long&#8208;term stability tests show excellent thermal stability (the optimized device without encapsulation maintaining 82&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 800&#8197;h aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C) and an improved light stability under illumination. This work provides a new method, the elastic modulus regulation, to enhance the ripening process.

         <title>Peptide Stapling via Crosslinking Two Amines with a&#8208;Ketoaldehydes through Diverse Modified Glyoxal&#8208;Lysine Dimer Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Ketoaldehydes play versatile roles in the ubiquitous natural processes of protein glycation. However, leveraging the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes for biomedical applications has been challenging. Previously, the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehydes with guanidine has been harnessed to design probes for labeling Arg residues on proteins in an aqueous medium. Herein, a highly effective, broadly applicable, and operationally simple protocol for stapling native peptides by crosslinking two amino groups through diverse imidazolium linkers with various &#945;&#8208;ketoaldehyde reagents is described. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent facilitates rapid and clean reactions under mild conditions and enables unique selectivity for Lys over Arg. The naturally occurring GOLD/MOLD linkers have been expanded to encompass a wide range of modified glyoxal&#8208;lysine dimer (OLD) linkers. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept trial, these modular stapling reactions enabled a convenient two&#8208;round strategy to streamline the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study of the wasp venom peptide anoplin, leading to enhanced biological activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored&#160;Exfoliation of Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and CH4 Valorization Mediated by O2 Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exfoliation of bulk C3N4 (BCN) into ultrathin layered structure is an effective strategy to boost photocatalytic efficiency by exposing interior active sites and accelerating charge separation and transportation. Herein, we report a novel nitrate anion intercalation&#8211;decomposition (NID) strategy that is effective in peeling off BCN into few&#8208;layer C3N4 (fl&#8208;CN) with tailored thickness down to bi&#8208;layer. This strategy only involves hydrothermal treatment of BCN in diluted HNO3 aqueous solution, followed by pyrolysis at various temperatures. The decomposition of the nitrate anions not only exfoliates BCN and changes the band structure, but also incorporates oxygen species onto fl&#8208;CN, which is conducive to O2 adsorption and hence relevant chemical processes. In photocatalytic O2 reduction under visible light irradiation, the H2O2 production rate over the optimal fl&#8208;CN&#8208;530 catalyst is 952 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, which is 8.8 times that over BCN. More importantly, under full arc irradiation and in the absence of hole scavenger, CH4 can be photocatalytically oxidized by on&#8208;site formed H2O2 and active oxygen species to generate value&#8208;added C1 oxygenates with high selectivity of 99.2% and record&#8208;high production rate of 1893 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 among the metal&#8208;free C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Steroidal 9&#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation and Fragmentation Enable the Concise Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Secosteroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>9,10&#8208;Secosteroids are an important group of marine steroids with diverse biological activities. Herein, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for the concise, modular, and scalable synthesis of ten naturally occurring 9,10&#8208;secosteroids from readily available steroids in three to eight steps. The key feature lies in utilizing a Rieske oxygenase&#8208;like 3&#8208;ketosteroid 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylase (KSH) as the biocatalyst to achieve efficient C9&#8211;C10 bond cleavage and A&#8208;ring aromatization of tetracyclic steroids through 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxylation and fragmentation. With synthesized 9,10&#8208;secosteroides, structure&#8208;activity relationship was evaluated based on bioassays in terms of previously unexplored anti&#8208;infective activity. This study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the biosynthetic pathway through which 9,10&#8208;secosteroids are formed in nature shares a similar reaction cascade. In addition to the development of a biomimetic approach for 9,10&#8208;secosteroid synthesis, this study highlights the great potential of chemoenzymatic strategies in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides with increased reactivity were created by introducing additional substituents to the prolinyl ring. Both alkyl and carboxyl groups increase the rate of nucleotide release and enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying, demonstrating how powerful prolines are as leaving groups.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated into growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as a leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4&#8197;h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Herein we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11&#8197;min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl prolinyl NMP was shown to react sevenfold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.

         <title>Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cu porphyrins with fine&#8208;tuned electronic structures are synthesized and examined as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytically active species switches from a formal CuI species to a formal Cu0 species upon decreasing the electron density of these Cu porphyrins. This work presents an unparalleled example of regulating hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism via electronic tuning of catalysts.







Abstract
The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through controllable and regioselective &#946;&#8208;oxidation of Cu porphyrin 1, we synthesized analogues 2&#8211;4 with one or two &#946;&#8208;lactone groups in either a cis or trans configuration. Complexes 1&#8211;4 have the same Cu&#8208;N4 core site but different electronic structures. Although &#946;&#8208;oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions, 1&#8211;4 displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a CuI species for 1 to a Cu0 species for 4. This work is thus significant to present mechanism&#8208;controllable HER via electronic tuning of catalysts.

     alt="Switching Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Pathways through Electronic Tuning of Copper Porphyrins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of Cu porphyrins with fine-tuned electronic structures are synthesized and examined as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytically active species switches from a formal Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species to a formal Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species upon decreasing the electron density of these Cu porphyrins. This work presents an unparalleled example of regulating hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism via electronic tuning of catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic structure of metal complexes plays key roles in determining their catalytic features. However, controlling electronic structures to regulate reaction mechanisms is of fundamental interest but has been rarely presented. Herein, we report electronic tuning of Cu porphyrins to switch pathways of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through controllable and regioselective &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-oxidation of Cu porphyrin &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, we synthesized analogues &lt;b&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/b&gt; with one or two &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-lactone groups in either a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; configuration. Complexes &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;4&lt;/b&gt; have the same Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core site but different electronic structures. Although &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-oxidation led to large anodic shifts of reductions, &lt;b&gt;1&#8211;4&lt;/b&gt; displayed similar HER activities in terms of close overpotentials. With electrochemical, chemical and theoretical results, we show that the catalytically active species switches from a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to a Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species for &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;.

         <title>Synthesis and Detection of BODIPY&#8208;, Biotin&#8208;, and 19F&#8208; Labeled Single&#8208;Entity Dendritic Heparan Sulfate Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeled single&#8208;entity heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics were synthesized to investigate their cellular distribution, involvement with the immune system, and biodistribution. A fluorescently labeled HS mimetic was observed in the brain of mice and was shown to preferentially associate with immune cells from the tumor site rather than from the spleen. The compounds reported represent a new tool box helping to unravel the mechanism of action of HS mimetics.







Abstract
Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are naturally occurring mammalian glycosaminoglycans, and their synthetic and semi&#8208;synthetic mimetics have attracted significant interest as potential therapeutics. However, understanding the mechanism of action by which HS, heparin, and HS mimetics have a biological effect is difficult due to their highly charged nature, broad protein interactomes, and variable structures. To address this, a library of novel single&#8208;entity dendritic mimetics conjugated to BODIPY, Fluorine&#8208;19 (19F), and biotin was synthesized for imaging and localization studies. The novel dendritic scaffold allowed for the conjugation of labeling moieties without reducing the number of sulfated capping groups, thereby better mimicking the multivalent nature of HS&#8208;protein interactions. The 19F labeled mimetics were assessed in phantom studies and were detected at concentrations as low as 5&#8197;mM. Flow cytometric studies using a fluorescently labeled mimetic showed that the compound associated with immune cells from tumors more readily than splenic counterparts and was directed to endosomal&#8208;lysosomal compartments within immune cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, the fluorescently labeled mimetic entered the central nervous system and was detectable in brain&#8208;infiltrating immune cells 24&#8197;hours after treatment. Here, we report the enabling methodology for rapidly preparing various labeled HS mimetics and molecular probes with diverse potential therapeutic applications.

         <title>Molecular and Structural Basis for C&#947;&#8722;C Bond Formation by PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Fub7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fub7, a pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzyme, catalyzes stereoselective and substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective C&#947;&#8722;C bond formations. Now a structural and enzymological study have elucidated the structural and molecular underpinnings of its catalytic specificity and selectivity, paving the way for harnessing its activity in the synthesis of cyclic noncanonical amino acids.







Abstract
Pyridoxal 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate (PLP)&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze &#947;&#8208;replacement reactions are prevalent, yet their utilization of carbon nucleophile substrates is rare. The recent discovery of two PLP&#8208;dependent enzymes, CndF and Fub7, has unveiled unique C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities, enabling the biocatalytic synthesis of alkyl&#8208; substituted pipecolic acids from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine and &#946;&#8208;keto acid or aldehyde derived enolates. This breakthrough presents fresh avenues for the biosynthesis of pipecolic acid derivatives. However, the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes remain elusive, and a dearth of structural information hampers their extensive application. Here, we have broadened the catalytic scope of Fub7 by employing ketone&#8208;derived enolates as carbon nucleophiles, revealing Fub7&#8217;s capacity for substrate&#8208;dependent regioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones. Through an integrated approach combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and computational docking studies, we offer a detailed mechanistic insight into Fub7 catalysis. Our findings elucidate the structural basis for its substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity. Our work sets the stage ready for subsequent protein engineering effort aimed at expanding the synthetic utility of Fub7, potentially unlocking novel methods to access a broader array of noncanonical amino acids.

         <title>A Boron Scan of Ethyl Acetoacetate Leads to Versatile Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry. This study presents borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. We show how the corresponding building blocks can be converted into borylated heterocycles. The regiochemistry of homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates was found to be related to the steric bulk of the diazo species.

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K was achieved by the Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy in outer space, inducing surface nucleation and rapid solidification. High spherical alloy droplets assure precise determination of liquid properties. High&#8208;temperature liquid&#8216;s chemical bonds and atomic structures were revealed.







Abstract
The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000&#8197;K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8722;Si and Zr&#8722;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2338&#8197;K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogeneous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.

         <title>Reversible Radical Addition Guides Selective Photocatalytic Intermolecular Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Ene Molecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photoredox three&#8208;component coupling of thiols with readily available alkynes and alkenes has been developed. The reaction mechanism was evaluated by combining ESI&#8208;HRMS, EPR spectroscopy, isotope labeling and control experiments. The applicability of the reversible radical addition approach for intermolecular reactions and the key role of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions in stereoselectivity control have been shown by DFT studies.







Abstract
In modern organic chemistry, harnessing the power of multicomponent radical reactions presents both significant challenges and extraordinary potential. This article delves into this scientific frontier by addressing the critical issue of controlling selectivity in such complex processes. We introduce a novel approach that revolves around the reversible addition of thiyl radicals to multiple bonds, reshaping the landscape of multicomponent radical reactions. The key to selectivity lies in the intricate interplay between reversibility and the energy landscapes governing C&#8722;C bond formation in thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reactions. The developed approach not only allows to prioritize the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene cascade, dominating over alternative reactions, but also extends the scope of coupling products obtained from alkenes and alkynes of various structures and electron density distributions, regardless of their relative polarity difference, opening doors to more versatile synthetic possibilities. In the present study, we provide a powerful tool for atom&#8208;economical C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, paving the way for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Carrying out our experimental and computational studies, we elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying radical cascades, a knowledge that can be broadly applied in the field of organic chemistry.

         <title>Grafting Ultra&#8208;fine Nanoalloys with Amorphous Skin Enables Highly Active and Long&#8208;lived Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of grafting PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; onto ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys achieved the effects of three birds with one stone: improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface, increased the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, and mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic environments.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale deployment of proton exchange membranes water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE) requires a substantial reduction in usage of platinum group metals (PGMs) as indispensable electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ultra&#8208;fine PGMs nanocatalysts possess abundant catalytic sites at lower loading, but usually exhibit reduced stability in long&#8208;term operations under corrosive acidic environments. Here we report grafting the ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys with PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; (c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez) by in situ atomic layer selenation to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and stability. We found that the c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez&#8208;1 with ~0.6&#8197;nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra&#8208;high mass activity of 26.7&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt+Ru at &#8722;0.07&#8197;V as well as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability maintained for at least 1000&#8197;h at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 550&#8197;h at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra&#8208;fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.

         <title>Tuning the Absorption, Fluorescence, Intramolecular Charge Transfer, and Intersystem Crossing in Spiro[fluorene]acridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design and photophysical investigation of donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one uncover the complex interplay among different light&#8208;driven pathways, including intramolecular charge transfer, fluorescence, and intersystem crossing. This investigation offers important guidance for designing novel functional materials for triplet sensitizers and fluorescent sensors.







Abstract
In this work, we prepared a series of electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems based on spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,7&#8217;&#8208;dibenzo[c,h]acridine]&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;one (SFDBAO). Our SFDBAOs consist of orthogonally positioned fluorenes and aromatic ketones. By fine&#8208;tuning the substitution of electron&#8208;donating pyrenes, the complex interplay among different excited&#8208;state decay channels and the overall impact of solvents on these decay channels were uncovered. Placing pyrene, for example, at the aromatic ketones resulted in a profound solvatochromism in the form of a bright charge&#8208;transfer (CT) emission spanning from yellow to red&#8208;NIR. In contrast, a dark non&#8208;emissive CT was noted upon pyrene substitution at the fluorenes. In apolar solvents, efficient triplet&#8208;excited state generation was observed for all SFDBAOs. Either charge transfer was concluded to mediate the intersystem crossing (ISC) in the case of pyrene substitution or the El&#8208;Sayed rule was applicable when lacking pyrene substitution as in the case of SFABAO. In polar solvents, charge separation is the sole decay upon pyrene substitution. Moreover, competition between ISC and CT lowered the triplet&#8208;excited state generation in SFDBAO.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Additive Enables High Moisture Tolerance and Favorable Electric Double Layer for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The in situ generated nitrogenous and fluoride&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase with LTFAN vastly accelerates the interfacial reaction dynamics, and dual&#8208;salt additive notably strengthens the moisture tolerance. A thermodynamically favorable electric double layer at charged cathode interface is constructed.







Abstract
The carbonate electrolyte chemistry is a primary determinant for the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, their implementation is greatly plagued by sluggish electrode interfacial dynamics and insufficient electrolyte thermodynamic stability. Herein, lithium trifluoroacetate&#8208;lithium nitrate (LiTFA&#8722;LiNO3) dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. We reveal that 1) the in situ generated inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI) enables rapid interfacial dynamics, 2) TFA&#8722; preferentially interacts with moisture over PF6&#8722; to strengthen the moisture tolerance of designed electrolyte, and 3) NO3&#8722; is found to be noticeably enriched at the cathode interface on charging, thus constructing Li+&#8208;enriched, solvent&#8208;coordinated, thermodynamically favorable electric double layer (EDL). The superior moisture tolerance of LTFAN and the thermodynamically stable EDL constructed at cathode interface play a decisive role in upgrading the compatibility of carbonate electrolyte with high&#8208;voltage cathode. The LMBs with LTFAN realize 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;NCM523/4.4&#8197;V&#8208;NCM622 superior cycling reversibility and excellent rate capability, which is the leading level of documented records for carbonate electrode.

         <title>Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous production of pure formic acid solution with high concentration (2&#8197;M) for more than 300&#8197;h was achieved by using an MEA electrolyzer containing solid state electrolytes equipped with our developed moist heat ventilation collection system. The resultant formic acid could directly serve as the fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, which closed the carbon cycle loop of the formic acid economy.







Abstract
The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid production at 2&#8197;M at an industrial&#8208;level current densities (i.e., 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for 300&#8197;h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice&#8208;distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2&#8201;% and a highest partial formate current density of 1.16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. To assess the practicality of this system, we perform a comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis and life cycle assessment, showing that our approach can potentially substitute conventional methyl formate hydrolysis for industrial formic acid production.

     alt="Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous production of pure formic acid solution with high concentration (2&#8197;M) for more than 300&#8197;h was achieved by using an MEA electrolyzer containing solid state electrolytes equipped with our developed moist heat ventilation collection system. The resultant formic acid could directly serve as the fuel for air-breathing formic acid fuel cells, which closed the carbon cycle loop of the formic acid economy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction for formic acid production at 2&#8197;M at an industrial-level current densities (i.e., 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 300&#8197;h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice-distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2&#8201;% and a highest partial formate current density of 1.16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Furthermore, the resultant formic acid serves as direct fuel for air-breathing formic acid fuel cells, boasting a power density of 55&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an exceptional thermal efficiency of 20.1&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Visualization of Lithium Plating/Stripping Tuned by On&#8208;site Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Using in situ methods of atomic force microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical microscopy, we visualized the processes of Li plating, stripping and replating tuned by the on&#8208;site formed SEI at the argyrodite solid&#8208;electrolyte/Li anode interface in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Our work provides insights into correlations between the interfacial evolution and cell performance, contributing to the improvement of solid&#8208;state energy devices.







Abstract
The interfacial processes, mainly the lithium (Li) plating/stripping and the evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), are directly related to the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLBs). However, the complex processes at solid&#8208;solid interfaces are embedded under the solid&#8208;state electrolyte, making it challenging to analyze the dynamic processes in real time. Here, using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy, we directly visualized the Li plating/stripping/replating behavior, and measured the morphological and mechanical properties of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at nanoscale. Li spheres plating/stripping/replating at the argyrodite solid electrolyte (Li6PS5Cl)/Li electrode interface is coupled with the formation/wrinkling/inflating of the SEI on its surface. Combined with in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, details of the stepwise formation and physicochemical properties of SEI on the Li spheres are obtained. It is shown that higher operation rates can decrease the uniformity of the Li+&#8208;conducting networks in the SEI and worsen Li plating/stripping reversibility. By regulating the applied current rates, uniform nucleation and reversible plating/stripping processes can be achieved, leading to the extension of the cycling life. The in situ analysis of the on&#8208;site formed SEI at solid&#8208;solid interfaces provides the correlation between the interfacial evolution and the electrochemical performance in ASSLBs.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Zn Metal via a Localized Conjugated Layer for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile&#8208;based zinc ion conductor (CPANZ) with a localized conjugated structure is induced and achieved at low temperature by Lewis acidic Zn(OTf)2. The CPANZ layer effectively accelerates the Zn2+ migration but restricts the H+ migration. Encouragingly, the chemical corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction and other side reactions are significantly mitigated at the CPANZ@Zn anode and homogeneous Zn deposition/dissolution is guaranteed.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as promising and efficient energy storage systems owing to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. Nevertheless, the instability of zinc metal anodes, characterized by issues such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions, poses a significant barrier to widespread applications. Herein, we address this challenge by designing a localized conjugated structure comprising a cyclic polyacrylonitrile polymer (CPANZ), induced by a Zn2+&#8208;based Lewis acid (zinc trifluoromethylsulfonate) at a temperature of 120&#8201;&#176;C. The CPANZ layer on the Zn anode, enriched with appropriate pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich groups (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;), exhibits a notable affinity for Zn2+ with ample deposition sites. This zincophilic skeleton not only serves as a protective layer to guide the deposition of Zn2+ but also functions as proton channel blocker, regulating the proton flux to mitigate the hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the strong adhesion strength of the CPANZ layer guarantees its sustained protection to the Zn metal during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, the modified zinc electrode demonstrates long cycle life and high durability in both half&#8208;cell and pouch cells. These findings present a feasible approach to designing high performance aqueous anodes by introducing a localized conjugated layer.

         <title>Conditional Cooperativity in RAS Assembly Pathways on Nanodiscs and Altered GTPase Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and NMR revealed the structural mechanism for the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of both wild&#8208;type and oncogenic mutants of native, fully processed KRAS on the membrane. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers by reducing GTP hydrolysis and increasing GDP/GTP exchange.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., nanoclusters) of the RAS GTPase on the membrane act as scaffolds that activate downstream RAF kinases and drive MAPK signaling for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of nanoclustering remain largely unknown. Here, size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analyses revealed the structural basis of the cooperative assembly processes of fully processed KRAS, mutated in a quarter of human cancers. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition of the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild&#8208;type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction sequentially. Mutation&#8208;based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces were available for the assembly. Real&#8208;time NMR demonstrated that higher&#8208;order oligomers retain higher numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster&#8208;enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Tailored Polymer Molecular Weights for Specific Photovoltaic Applications through Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Simultaneous Physical and Chemical Events</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasonication&#8208;assisted polymerization is useful method to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymer with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers molecular weights with high reproducibility.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymers with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. Once such an easily accessible methodology is established, which can not only contribute to overcome the current limitation of the statistically determined nature of semiconducting polymers, but also facilitate rapid incorporation into the broad synthetic chemists&#8217; toolbox. Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high&#8208;precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers&#8217; molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer&#8208;based devices; as demonstrated in in&#8208;depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics. We believe that this methodology provides a fast development of new and existing semiconducting polymers with the highest&#8208;level performances possible on various photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Bioengineered Nanovesicle Vaccine Boosts T&#8208;B cell Interaction for Immunotherapy of Echinococcus multilocularis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a nanovesicle vaccine that displays multiple epitope peptides of Echinococcus multilocularis on the surface. The vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit Echinococcus multilocularis infection.







Abstract
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease, resulting from being infected with the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis (E.&#8197;multilocularis). Novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed since the current chemotherapy displays limited efficiency in AE treatment. Bioengineered nano cellular membrane vesicles are widely used for displaying the native conformational epitope peptides because of their unique structure and biocompatibility. In this study, four T&#8208;cells and four B&#8208;cells dominant epitope peptides of E.&#8197;multilocularis with high immunogenicity were engineered into the Vero cell surface to construct a membrane vesicle nanovaccine for the treatment of AE. The results showed that the nanovesicle vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit E.&#8197;multilocularis infection. This study presents for the first time a nanovaccine strategy that can completely eliminate the burden of E.&#8197;multilocularis.

         <title>Bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Reaction&#8208;Triggered Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Combined with Released Lonidamine for Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the application of bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between prodrug iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) and dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) to form highly photothermal&#8208;active nanoaggregates with synergistic drug release. The reactants of BCR reaction were grafted on surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and was proven both in vitro and in vivo to robustly enhance the therapeutic outcome of photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Cancer has been the most deadly disease, and 13 million cancer casualties are estimated to occur each year by 2030. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest due to its high spatiotemporal controllability and noninvasiveness. Due to the trade&#8208;off between particle size and photothermal efficiency of AuNPs, rational design is needed to realize aggregation of AuNPs into larger particles with desirable NIR adsorption in tumor site. Exploiting the bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between iminosydnone and cycloalkyne, aggregation of AuNPs can be achieved and attractively accompanied by the release of chemotherapeutic drug purposed to photothermal synergizing. We synthesize iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) as a prodrug and choose dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as the trigger of BCR reaction. A PEGylated AuNPs&#8208;based two&#8208;component nanoplatform consisting of prodrug&#8208;loaded AuNPs&#8208;ImLND and tumor&#8208;targeting peptide RGD&#8208;conjugated AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD is designed. In the therapeutic regimen, AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD are intravenously injected first for tumor&#8208;specific enrichment and retention. Once the arrival of AuNPs&#8208;ImLND injected later at tumor site, highly photothermally active nanoaggregates of AuNPs are formed via the BCR reaction between ImLND and DBCO. The simultaneous release of lonidamine further enhanced the therapeutic performance by sensitizing cancer cells to PTT.

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powdery h&#8208;BN with a micron&#8208;sized three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure was developed with a facile NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted approach based on reduced reaction temperature. It exhibited superior advantages in improving the electrochemical performance of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes compared with the commercial two&#8208;dimensional (2D) h&#8208;BN.







Abstract
Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogeneous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5&#8197;wt&#8201;% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300&#8197;h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and retains 89&#8201;% of discharge capacity (138.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the LFP//Li full cell.

         <title>Adaptisorption of Nonporous Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptisortion tailored for nonporous polymers has been achieved by dative boron&#8208;nitrogen bonding and host&#8208;guest binding. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymeric crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals.







Abstract
Although our knowledge and understanding of adsorptions in natural and artificial systems has increased dramatically during the past century, adsorption associated with nonporous polymers remains something of a mystery, hampering applications. Here we demonstrate a model system for adaptisorption of nonporous polymers, wherein dative B&#8722;N bonds and host&#8208;guest binding units act as the kinetic and thermodynamic components, respectively. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymer crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals. Adaptisorption of nonporous polymer crystals not only extends the types of adsorption in which the sorbate molecules are integrated in a precise and orderly manner in the sorbent systems, but also provides a facile and accurate approach to the construction of polymeric materials with precise architectures and integrated functions.

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for Ni2+ substitution of Co2+ to develop an oxide heterostructure on (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) for highly efficient electroreduction nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), where Ni plays a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary sites for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.







Abstract
Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8722; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8722;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.

     alt="Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3-Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a strategy for Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; substitution of Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to develop an oxide heterostructure on (Co&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) for highly efficient electroreduction nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR) to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), where Ni plays a dual role in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary sites for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; results in poor selectivity for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and excess NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR. (Co&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe exhibited a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; evolution over (Co&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Li2O2 Growth Behaviors in Li&#8722;O2 Batteries via Photo&#8208;Assistant Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Widely acknowledged that the capacity of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) should be strongly determined by growth behaviors of the discharge product of Li2O2 that follows both coexisting surface and solution growth pathways. However up until now, it remains still challenging to achieve dynamic modulation on Li2O2 morphologies. Herein, the photo&#8208;responsive Au nanoparticles (NPs) supported on reduced oxide graphene (Au/rGO) have been utilized as cathode to manipulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics by aid of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effects. Thus, we can experimentally reveal the importance of matching ORR kinetics with Li+ migration towards battery performance. Moreover, it is found that Li+ concentration polarization caused &#8220;sudden death&#8221; of LOBs is supposed to be just a form of suspended animation that could timely recover under irradiation. This work provides us an in&#8208;depth explanation on the working mechanism of LOBs from a kinetic perspective, offering valuable insights for the future battery design.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Utilization of Latent Heat in Erythritol&#8208;based Phase Change Materials as Solar Thermal Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar thermal fuels (STFs) have been particularly concerned as sustainable future energy due to their impressive ability to store solar energy in chemical bonds and controllably release thermal energy. However, currently studied STFs mainly focus on molecule&#8208;based materials with high photochemical activity, toxicity, and compromised features, which greatly restricts their applications in practical scenarios of solar energy utilization. Herein, we present a novel erythritol&#8208;based composite phase change material (PCM) as a new type of STFs with an outstanding capability to store solar energy as latent heat in its stable supercooling state and release thermal energy as needed. This composite PCM with stored thermal energy can be maintained stably at room temperature and subsequently release latent heat as high as 224.9 J/g during the crystallization process triggered by thermal stimuli. Remarkably, solar energy can be converted into latent heat stored in the composite PCM over months. Through mechanical stimulations, the released latent heat can increase the temperature of the composite up to 91 &#176;C. This work presents a new concept of using spatiotemporal storage and release of latent heat in PCMs for solar energy utilization, making it a potential candidate as STFs for developing future clean energy techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Atom Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), distinguished by their maximum atom efficiency and precise control over the coordination and electronic properties of individual atoms, show great promise in electrocatalysis. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electrochemical performance of SACs requires the screening of electron transfer process at micro/nano scale. This research pioneers the use of electrogenerated chemiluminescence microscopy (ECLM) to observe the electrocatalytic reactions at individual SACs. It boasts sensitivity at the single photon level and temporal resolution down to 100 ms, enabling real&#8208;time capture of the electrochemical behavior of individual SACs during potential sweeping. Leveraging the direct correlation between ECL emission and heterogeneous electron transfer processes, we introduced photon flux density for quantitative analysis, unveiling the electrocatalytic efficiency of individual SACs. This approach systematically reveals the relationship between SACs based on different metal atoms and their peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. The outcomes contribute to a fundamental understanding of SACs and pave the way for designing SACs with diverse technological and industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiodivergent reactions are a fascinating tool to rapidly access molecular diversity while using identical coupling partners. We have developed a new approach for regiodivergent synthesis using the dual character of hypervalent bromines. In addition to the recently reported reactivity of hypervalent bromines as aryne precursors, the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reaction is reported. Accordingly, the development of these two complementary transformations allows for alteration of regioselectivity to furnish both&#160;ortho&#8208; and&#160;meta&#8208;substituted alkynylation products. Mechanistic and computational studies show how these selectivities are controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Conductive Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ether Chains as Solid Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are often used for Li+ conduction as they can dissociate the Li salts efficiently. However, high entanglement of the chains and lack of pathways for rapid ion diffusion limit their applications in advanced batteries. Recent developments in ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) showed that their highly ordered structures provide efficient pathways for Li+ transport, solving the limitations of traditional PEO&#8208;based electrolytes. Here, we present imidazolate COFs, PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, having methoxyethoxy chains, synthesized by Debus&#8211;Radziszewski multicomponent reactions and their ionized form, Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs, showing a high Li+ conductivity of 8.81 mS cm&#8722;1 and a transference number of 0.974. The mechanism for such excellent electrochemical properties is that methoxyethoxy chains dissociate LiClO4, making free Li+, then those Li+ are transported through the imidazolate COFs&#8217; pores. The synthesized Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs formed a stable interface with Li metal. Thus, employing Li+@PI&#8208;TMEFB&#8208;COFs as the solid electrolyte to assemble LiFePO4 batteries showed an initial discharge capacity of 119.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, and 82.0 % capacity and 99.9 % Coulombic efficiency were maintained after 400 cycles. These results show that iCOFs with ether chains synthesized via multicomponent reactions can create a new chapter for making solid electrolytes for advanced rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Applying a single molecular probe to monitor enzymatic activities in multiple, complementary imaging modalities is highly desirable to ascertain detection and to avoid the complexity associated with the use of agents of different chemical entities. We demonstrate here the versatility of lanthanide (Ln3+) complexes with respect to their optical and magnetic properties and their potential for enzymatic detection in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1 MR imaging, controlled by the nature of the Ln3+ ion, while using a unique chelator. Based on X&#8208;ray structural, photophysical, and solution NMR investigations of a family of Ln3+ DO3A&#8208;pyridine model complexes, we could rationalize the luminescence (Eu3+, Yb3+), CEST (Yb3+) and relaxation (Gd3+) properties and their variations between carbamate and amine derivatives. This allowed the design of &#160;probes which undergo enzyme&#8208;mediated changes detectable in NIR luminescence, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI, respectively governed by variations in their absorption energy, in their exchanging proton pool and in their size, thus relaxation efficacy. We demonstrate that these properties can be exploited for the visualization of b&#8208;galactosidase activity in phantom samples by different imaging modalities: NIR optical imaging, CEST and T1&#8208;weighted MRI.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Complex Polyenes through Sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of trans&#8208;Styrenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes is presented. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization via a six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;palladacycle to afford tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization via a seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;palladacycle to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide.







Abstract
Sequential C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules containing multiple C&#8722;H bonds can efficiently lead to structural diversity. Herein we present the first chelation&#8208;assisted sequential &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization of E&#8208;styrenes with simple alkenes and alkynes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. The process involves &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization by six&#8208;membered exo&#8208;cyclopalladation to result in tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted 1,3&#8208;dienes and &#946; C&#8722;H functionalization through seven&#8208;membered endo&#8208;cyclopalladation to produce tetra&#8208; and pentasubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;trienes in up to 97&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99/1 E/Z selectivity, both enabled by the chelation assistance of pyrazinamide. The protocol is demonstrated to be widely applicable, tolerant to a wide range of functional groups and bioactive fragments, and suitable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as one&#8208;pot and two step preparation of trienes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the selectivity and reactivity.

         <title>Eu(OTf)3&#8208;Catalyzed Formal Dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition of Bicyclo&#8208;[1.1.0]butanes with Nitrones: Access to Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Rapid access of diverse polysubstituted 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with easily accessible nitrones.







Abstract
Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.

         <title>Engineered Anchor Peptide LCI with a Cobalt Cofactor Enhances Oxidation Efficiency of Polystyrene Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C with a flexible cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L2 hydroxylated polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. The oxidation using biohybrid catalyst (Co&#8208;L2@LCI_F16C) showed 15 times higher functionalization level than using the free cobalt cofactors.







Abstract
A typical component of polymer waste is polystyrene (PS) used in numerous applications, but degraded only slowly in the environment due to its hydrophobic properties. To increase the reactivity of polystyrene, polar groups need to be introduced. Here, biohybrid catalysts based on the engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C are presented, which are capable of attaching to polystyrene microparticles and hydroxylating benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. LCI peptides achieve a dense surface coverage of PS through monolayer formation within minutes in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The catalytically active cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L1 or Co&#8208;L2 with a modified NNNN macrocyclic TACD ligand (TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane) is covalently bound to the anchor peptide LCI through a maleimide linker. Compared to the free cofactors, a 12&#8208; to 15&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity using biohybrid catalysts based on LCI_F16C was observed.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Porous Fullerene Membranes for Ultimate Organic Solvent Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with high chemical stability have attracted intensive interest in membrane design for the separation of organic solvents. As a novel 2D material, polymeric fullerenes (C60)&#8734; with distinctive properties are very promising for the development of innovative membranes. In this work, we report the construction of a 2D (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane for organic solvent separation. The pathways of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheet membrane are constructed by sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm lateral channels and nanoscale in&#8208;plane pores created by the depolymerization of the (C60)&#8734; nanosheets. Attributing to ordered and shortened transport pathways, the ultrathin porous (C60)&#8734; membrane is superior in organic solvent separation. The hexane, acetone, and methanol fluxes are up to 1146.3&#177;53, 900.4&#177;41, and 879.5&#177;42 kg&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1, respectively, which are up to 130 times higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with similar dye rejection. Our findings demonstrate the prospect of 2D (C60)&#8734; as a promising nanofiltration membrane in the separation of organic solvents from macromolecular compounds such as dyes, drugs, hormones, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective and Efficient Perdeuteration of n&#8208;Pentane via H/D Exchange Catalyzed by a Silica&#8208;Supported Hafnium&#8208;Iridium Bimetallic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Surface OrganoMetallic Chemistry (SOMC) approach is used to prepare a novel hafnium&#8208;iridium catalyst immobilized on silica, HfIr/SiO2, featuring well&#8208;defined [&#8801;SiOHf(CH2tBu)2(&#956;&#8208;H)3IrCp*] surface sites. Unlike the monometallic analogous materials Hf/SiO2 and Ir/SiO2, which promote n&#8208;pentane deuterogenolysis through C&#8208;C bond scission, we demonstrate that under the same experimental conditions (1 bar D2, 250&#176;C, 3h, 0.5 mol%), the heterobimetallic catalyst HfIr/SiO2 is highly efficient and selective for the perdeuteration of alkanes with D2, exemplified on n&#8208;pentane, without substantial deuterogenolysis (&lt;2% at 95% conversion). Furthermore this HfIr/SiO2 catalyst is robust and can be re&#8208;used several times without evidence of decomposition. This represents substantial advance in catalytic H/D isotope exchange (HIE) reactions of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectron Migration Boosted by Hollow Double&#8208;Shell Dyads Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on noble metal&#8208;free systems is a promising technology for the conversion of solar energy into green hydrogen, it is pivotal and challenging to tailor&#8208;make photocatalysts for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported a hollow double&#8208;shell dyad through uniformly coating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the surface of hollow Co9S8. The double shell architecture enhances the scattering and refraction efficiency of incident light, shortens the transmission distance of the photogenerated charge carriers, and exposes more active sites for photocatalytic conversion. The hydrogen evolution rate is as high as 23.15 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which is significantly enhanced when compared with that of their physical mixture (0.30 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) and Pt&#8208;based counterpart (11.84 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). This work provides a rational approach to the construction of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems based on COFs to enhance hydrogen evolution performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell Membrane as&#160;A Promising Therapeutic Target: From Materials Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell membrane is a crucial component of cells, protecting their integrity and stability while facilitating signal transduction and information exchange. Therefore, disrupting its structure or impairing its functions can potentially cause irreversible cell damage. Presently, the tumor cell membrane is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for various treatment methods. Given the extensive research focused on cell membranes, it is both necessary and timely to discuss these developments, from materials design to specific biomedical applications. This review covers treatments based on functional materials targeting the cell membrane, ranging from well&#8208;known  membrane&#8208;anchoring photodynamic therapy to recent lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras for protein degradation. The diverse therapeutic mechanisms are introduced in the following sections: membrane&#8208;anchoring phototherapy, self&#8208;assembly on the membrane, in situ biosynthesis on the membrane, and degradation of cell membrane proteins by chimeras. In each section, we outline the conceptual design or general structure derived from numerous studies, emphasizing representative examples to understand advancements and draw inspiration. Finally, we discuss some challenges and future directions in membrane&#8208;targeted therapy from our perspective. This review aims to engage multidisciplinary readers and encourage researchers in related fields to advance the fundamental theories and practical applications of membrane&#8208;targeting therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;Boosted Active Hydrogen on Copper for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is a promising approach in term of pollutant appreciation. Cu&#8208;based catalysts performs a leading&#8208;edge advantage for nitrate reduction due to its favorable adsorption with *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surface is difficult and insufficient, leading to the significant generation of by&#8208;product NO2&#8208;. Herein, sulphur doped Cu (Cu&#8208;S) is prepared via an electrochemical conversion strategy and used for nitrate electroreduction. The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia (~98.3%) and an extremely low FE of nitrite (~1.4%) are achieved on Cu&#8208;S, obviously superior to its counterpart of Cu (FENH3: 70.4%, FENO2&#8208;: 18.8%). Electrochemical in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that a small amount of S doping on Cu surface can promote the kinetics of H2O dissociation to active hydrogen. The optimized hydrogen affinity validly decreases the hydrogenation kinetic energy barrier of *NO2, leading to an enhanced NH3 selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;coordination Nanocrystalline Copper&#8208;based Catalysts through Theory&#8208;guided Electrochemical Restructuring for Selective CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Revealing the dynamic reconstruction process and tailoring advanced copper (Cu) catalysts is of paramount significance for promoting the conversion of CO2 into ethylene (C2H4), paving the way for carbon neutralization and facilitating renewable energy storage. In this study, we initially employed density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the restructuring behavior of a catalyst under electrochemical conditions and delineated its restructuring patterns. Leveraging insights into this restructuring behavior, we devised an efficient, low&#8208;coordination copper&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting synthesized catalyst demonstrated an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeding 70% for ethylene generation at a current density of 800 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, it showed robust stability, maintaining consistent performance for 230 hours at a cell voltage of 3.5 V in a full&#8208;cell system. Our research not only deepens the understanding of the active sites involved in designing efficient carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts but also advances CO2 electrolysis technologies for industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Multielectron Redox&#8208;Bipolar Tetranitroporphyrin Macrocycle Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar organics fuse the merits of n/p&#8208;type redox reactions for better Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs), but face the capacity plafond due to low density of active units and single&#8208;electron reactions. Here we report multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar tetranitroporphyrin (TNP) with quadruple two&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type nitro motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type amine moieties towards high&#8208;capacity&#8208;voltage ZOBs. TNP cathode initiates high&#8208;kinetics, hybrid anion&#8722;cation 10e&#8722; charge storage involving four nitro sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential and two amine species coupling with SO42&#8722; ions at high potential. Consequently, Zn||TNP battery harvests high capacity (338 mAh g&#8722;1), boosted average voltage (1.08 V), and outstanding energy density (365 Wh kg&#8722;1TNP). Moreover, the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated TNP macrocycle achieves anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, prolonging the battery life to 50,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 with 71.6% capacity retention. This work expands the chemical landscape of multielectron redox&#8208;bipolar organics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Formamidinium Lead Iodide&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25% Enabled by An Amphiphilic Molecular Hole&#8208;Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted&#8208;structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film&#8208;forming on hydrophobic or defective hole&#8208;transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole&#8208;transporter, (2&#8208;(4&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazin&#8208;10&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ&#8208;CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ&#8208;CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole&#8208;selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective material (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ&#8208;CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four&#8208;fold) and Shockley&#8208;Read&#8208;Hall lifetime (eight&#8208;fold). Moreover, the PTZ&#8208;CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole&#8208;collection. Consequently, FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ&#8208;CPA based device shows commendable long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40oC for 2000 hours.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) represents an optimal absorber material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while the application of FAPbI3 in inverted-structured PSCs has yet to be successful, mainly owing to its inferior film-forming on hydrophobic or defective hole-transporting substrates. Herein, we report a substantial improvement of FAPbI3-based inverted PSCs, which is realized by a multifunctional amphiphilic molecular hole-transporter, (2-(4-(10H-phenothiazin-10-yl)phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid (PTZ-CPA). The phenothiazine (PTZ) based PTZ-CPA, carrying a cyanovinyl phosphonic acid (CPA) group, forms a superwetting hole-selective underlayer that enables facile deposition of high-quality FAPbI3 thin films. Compared to a previously established carbazole-based hole-selective material (2-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz), the crystallinity of FAPbI3 is enhanced and the electronic defects are passivated by the PTZ-CPA more effectively, resulting in remarkable increases in photoluminescence quantum yield (four-fold) and Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime (eight-fold). Moreover, the PTZ-CPA shows a larger molecular dipole moment and improved energy level alignment with FAPbI3, benefiting the interfacial hole-collection. Consequently, FAPbI3-based inverted PSCs achieve an unprecedented efficiency of 25.35% under simulated air mass 1.5 (AM1.5) sunlight. The PTZ-CPA based device shows commendable long-term stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation at 40oC for 2000 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, thermal runaway of LIBs with these cathodes leads to great safety concerns. In this study, single crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) has been prepared and a flexible optical fiber was buried inside the pouch&#8208;type LIBs with NCM&#8208;SC cathode to in&#8208;situ study its real&#8208;time temperature evolution during charge/discharge process. NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an enhanced Li+ ions transportation efficiency and electrode reaction kinetics, which can effectively reduce the generation of polarization heat and mitigate the internal temperature rise of the pouch&#8208;type battery. Meanwhile, solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) film decomposition and gas accumulation are effectively alleviated, due to the enhanced thermal stability of SEI film formed on NCM&#8208;SC. Moreover, the single crystal architecture can effectively retard layered to spinal and rock&#8208;salt phase transition, mitigate the crack formation and structural collapse. Consequently, NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and enhanced thermal stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Delocalization Engineering of Heme&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Enzymes for Augmented Reactive Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8208;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of L&#8208;RNA Aptamer&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Efficient Cell Uptake and G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;Mediated Gene Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel strategy for transporting L&#8208;RNA aptamers that target rG4s into the cytosol using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). Polyarginine residues (R8) were covalently attached to the L&#8208;aptamer by click chemistry and the first L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;CPP conjugate (Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c) was generated. Our study demonstrates that Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c functions as an effective tool for regulating rG4&#8208;mediated gene expression.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (D&#8208;rG4s) are prevalent in the transcriptome and play crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes. Recently, L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been reported to recognize functional rG4s with a strong binding affinity and specificity. However, owing to the poor cell penetration capacity of L&#8208;RNA aptamers, their biological applications are currently limited. Herein, we rationally design an L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;peptide conjugate, Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c, which can efficiently translocate into the cytosol and target the rG4 of interest. Notably, we demonstrate diverse regulatory roles of Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c on rG4 motif present in different regions of mRNAs and further expand the application in different cell lines. Our novel and biocompatible conjugate enhances the cellular uptake of the L&#8208;RNA aptamer, and our robust strategy enables non&#8208;canonical RNA structures to be targeted by L&#8208;RNA aptamers for gene control in cells.

         <title>Generation of a Hydrophobic Protrusion on Nanoparticles to Improve the Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Ability and Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable hydrophobic protrusion was created on Janus particles to regulate the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interactions. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, lead the particle to dock to the membrane, and then draw the whole particle into the cell, improving the efficiencies of both membrane&#8208;anchoring and cellular internalization.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction to achieve easy and fast membrane anchoring and cellular internalization is of great importance in a variety of biomedical applications. Here we report a simple and versatile strategy to maneuver the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction by creating a tunable hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles through swelling&#8208;induced symmetry breaking. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, leading the particles to docking to the membrane, followed by drawing the whole particles into the cell. The efficiencies of both membrane anchoring and cellular internalization can be promoted by optimizing the size of the protrusion. In vitro, the Janus particles can quickly anchor to the cell membrane in 1&#8197;h and be internalized within 24&#8197;h, regardless of the types of cells involved. In vivo, the Janus particles can effectively anchor to the brain and skin tissues to provide a high retention in these tissues after intracerebroventricular, intrahippocampal, or subcutaneous injection. This strategy involving the creation of a hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles to tune the cell&#8208;membrane interaction holds great potential in nanoparticle&#8208;based biomedical applications.

         <title>Stabilizing Sulfur Sites in Tetraoxygen Tetrahedral Coordination Structure for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetraoxygen tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside NiO is produced by encapsulating S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide. This unique structure could trigger a S&#8208;promoted lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (SLOM) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which greatly elevated the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Ion regulation strategy is regarded as a promising pathway for designing transition metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with improved activity and stability. Precise anion conditioning can accurately change the anionic environment so that the acid radical ions (SO42&#8722;, PO32&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, etc.), regardless of their state (inside the catalyst, on the catalyst surface, or in the electrolyte), can optimize the electronic structure of the cationic active site and further increase the catalytic activity. Herein, we report a new approach to encapsulate S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl&#8208;type oxide NiO to form a tetraoxo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination structure (S&#8208;O4) inside the NiO (S&#8208;NiO&#8201;&#8208;I). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and operando vibrational spectroscopy proves that this kind of unique structure could achieve the S&#8208;O4 and Ni&#8208;S stable structure in S&#8208;NiO&#8208;I. Combining mass spectroscopy characterization, it could be confirmed that the S&#8208;O4 structure is the key factor for triggering the lattice oxygen exchange to participate in the OER process. This work demonstrates that the formation of tetraoxygen tetrahedral structure is a generalized key for boosting the OER performances of transition metal oxides.

&lt;p&gt;The tetraoxygen tetrahedral coordination structure (S-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) inside NiO is produced by encapsulating S atoms at the tetrahedral sites of the NaCl-type oxide. This unique structure could trigger a S-promoted lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (SLOM) during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which greatly elevated the catalytic performance.

Temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto D&#8208;serine (DS) or D&#8208;threonine (DT) residues of synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase (L&#8208;OGA) to afford the desired D&#8208;protein targets.







Abstract
D&#8208;peptide ligands can be screened for therapeutic potency and enzymatic stability using synthetic mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins), but efficient acquisition of these D&#8208;proteins can be hampered by the need to accomplish their in vitro folding, which often requires the formation of correctly linked disulfide bonds. Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto selected D&#8208;serine or D&#8208;threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D&#8208;protein targets using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold D&#8208;proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror&#8208;image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D&#8208;TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror&#8208;image receptor&#8208;binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D&#8208;RBD). Our work establishes the use of O&#8208;GlcNAc to facilitate D&#8208;protein synthesis and folding and proves that D&#8208;proteins bearing O&#8208;GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase.

         <title>A Sulfur&#8208;Doped Copper Catalyst with Efficient Electrocatalytic Formate Generation during the Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A S&#8208;doped&#8208;Cu catalyst excluding post&#8208;transition metal was shown to exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This owes to the plenary grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds in CuS after electrolysis, while the latter factor can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates to further improve the activity.







Abstract
Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals has struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ex situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8722;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic element (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.

         <title>Perovskite Single Crystals with Self&#8208;Cleaning Surface for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface contamination issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals is addressed by the self&#8208;cleaning effect induced by an amphiphilic molecule, which leads to improved crystal properties and a record efficiency of 23.4&#8201;% for single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells. Moreover, this strategy applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphologies and compositions, which can contribute to improve other optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite single crystals are promising for diverse optoelectronic applications. As a universal issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals, surface contamination causes adverse effect on material properties and device performance. Herein, learning from the self&#8208;cleaning effect of lotus leaf, we address the surface contamination issue by introducing an amphiphilic long&#8208;chain organic amine into the perovskite crystal growth solution. Self&#8208;assembly of CTAC provides a hydrophobic crystal surface, inducing spontaneous removal of residual growth solution, which results in clean surface and better optoelectronic properties of perovskite single crystals. An impressive efficiency of 23.4&#8201;% is obtained, setting a new record for FAxMA1&#8208;xPbI3 single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Moreover, our strategy also applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphology and composition, which may contribute to improvement of other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Phase Control and Singlet Energy Transfer Enabled by Trimethylamine Modified Boron Dipyrromethene for Stable CsPbBr3 Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) driven can precisely control phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 quantum wells. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA, acting as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity, facilitates efficient singlet energy transfer (ET) and tailors the luminescent characteristics to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control.







Abstract
The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr3 growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP&#8208;TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr3. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA acts as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity in obtained BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. The BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.

BDP-TMA-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the thermally-induced dynamic fluorescence control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP-TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP-TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, BDP-TMA acts as a co-spacer organic entity in obtained BDP-TMA-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish-white emission. The BDP-TMA-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP-TMA-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the thermally-induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti-counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microbubble Biointerfacing by Regulation of the Platelet Membrane Surfactant Activity at the Gas&#8208;Liquid Interface for Acute Thrombosis Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbubbles can be biointerfaced by rationally regulating the platelet membrane surfactant activity at the gas&#8208;liquid interface. The protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratios (P&#8201;:&#8201;L ratios) of the platelet membranes are reduced to stabilize the platesome microbubbles (PMBs). The activated conformation of &#945;IIb&#946;3 grants PMBs the ability for molecular ultrasound diagnosis of acute thrombosis.







Abstract
Biointerfacing nanomaterials with cell membranes has been successful in the functionalization of nanoparticles or nanovesicles, but microbubble functionalization remains challenging due to the unique conformation of the lipid monolayer structure at the gas&#8208;liquid interface that provides insufficient surfactant activity. Here, we describe a strategy to rationally regulate the surfactant activity of platelet membrane vesicles by adjusting the ratio of proteins to lipids through fusion with synthetic phospholipids (i.e., liposomes). A &#8220;platesome&#8221; with the optimized protein&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio can be assembled at the gas&#8208;liquid interface in the same manner as pulmonary surfactants to stabilize a microsized gas bubble. Platesome microbubbles (PMBs) inherited 61.4&#8201;% of the platelet membrane vesicle proteins and maintained the active conformation of integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 without the talin&#8197;1 for fibrin binding. We demonstrated that the PMBs had good stability, long circulation, and superior functionality both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by molecular ultrasound imaging, the PMBs provide up to 11.8&#8197;dB of ultrasound signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio enhancement for discriminating between acute and chronic thrombi. This surface tension regulating strategy may provide a paradigm for biointerfacing microbubbles with cell membranes, offering a potential new approach for the construction of molecular ultrasound contrast agents for the diagnosis of different diseases.

         <title>Strikingly High Activity of 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase Towards Di&#8208;Polyunsaturated Arachidonoyl/Adrenoyl&#8208;Phosphatidylethanolamines Generates Peroxidation Signals of Ferroptotic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly polyunsaturated phospholipids are present in biomembranes, albeit at very low abundancies. Their specific function is not known. We discovered that 15&#8208;lipoxygenase catalyzes oxygenation of these phospholipids at the same high rate as free fatty acids and yield 15&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;products which act as pro&#8208;ferroptotic signals of cell death.







Abstract
The vast majority of membrane phospholipids (PLs) include two asymmetrically positioned fatty acyls: oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) attached predominantly at the sn2 position, and non&#8208;oxidizable saturated/monounsaturated acids (SFA/MUFA) localized at the sn1 position. The peroxidation of PUFA&#8208;PLs, particularly sn2&#8208;arachidonoyl(AA)&#8208; and sn2&#8208;adrenoyl(AdA)&#8208;containing phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), has been associated with the execution of ferroptosis, a program of regulated cell death. There is a minor subpopulation (&#8776;1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of doubly PUFA&#8208;acylated phospholipids (di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PLs) whose role in ferroptosis remains enigmatic. Here we report that 15&#8208;lipoxygenase (15LOX) exhibits unexpectedly high pro&#8208;ferroptotic peroxidation activity towards di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs. We revealed that peroxidation of several molecular species of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs occurred early in ferroptosis. Ferrostatin&#8208;1, a typical ferroptosis inhibitor, effectively prevented peroxidation of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs. Furthermore, co&#8208;incubation of cells with di&#8208;AA&#8208;PE and 15LOX produced PUFA&#8208;PE peroxidation and induced ferroptotic death. The decreased contents of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PEs in ACSL4 KO A375 cells was associated with lower levels of di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PE peroxidation and enhanced resistance to ferroptosis. Thus, di&#8208;PUFA&#8208;PE species are newly identified phospholipid peroxidation substrates and regulators of ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic target for many diseases related to ferroptotic death.

         <title>Reshaping Echinocandin Antifungal Drugs To Circumvent Glucan Synthase Point&#8208;Mutation&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>

A docking&#8208;based model elucidates how echinocandins form a ternary complex with their glucan synthase target and associated membrane lipids. Removing hemiaminal alcohol from echinocandins reduced, and benzylic dehydroxylation improved potency against echinocandin&#8208;resistant yeast. Candida strains exposed to rezafungin or its dehydroxylated derivative, RZF&#8208;1, evolved resistance, with RZF&#8208;1 showing significantly higher potency against these strains.







Abstract
Echinocandins are a class of antifungal drugs that inhibit the activity of the &#946;&#8208;(1,3)&#8208;glucan synthase complex, which synthesizes fungal cell wall &#946;&#8208;(1,3)&#8208;glucan. Echinocandin resistance is linked to mutations in the FKS gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the glucan synthase complex. We present a molecular&#8208;docking&#8208;based model that provides insight into how echinocandins interact with the target Fks protein: echinocandins form a ternary complex with both Fks and membrane lipids. We used reductive dehydration of alcohols to generate dehydroxylated echinocandin derivatives and evaluated their potency against a panel of Candida pathogens constructed by introducing resistance&#8208;conferring mutations in the FKS gene. We found that removing the hemiaminal alcohol, which drives significant conformational alterations in the modified echinocandins, reduced their efficacy. Conversely, eliminating the benzylic alcohol of echinocandins enhanced potency by up to two orders of magnitude, in a manner dependent upon the resistance&#8208;conferring mutation. Strains that have developed resistance to either rezafungin, the most recently clinically approved echinocandin, or its dehydroxylated derivative RZF&#8208;1, exhibit high resistance to rezafungin while demonstrating moderate resistance to RZF&#8208;1. These findings provide valuable insight for combating echinocandin resistance through chemical modifications.

         <title>Dynamic Shape Change of Liquid Crystal Polymer Based on An Order&#8208;Order Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodomain liquid crystal polymer exhibits dynamic shape changes, undergoing extension first and then contraction during both heating and cooling. This behavior is driven by a dynamic order&#8208;order smectic C to smectic A phase transition.







Abstract
Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order&#8208;disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order&#8208;order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re&#8208;entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower&#8208;shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.

&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order-disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order-order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re-entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower-shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction Kinetics using a Chemputable Framework for Data Collection and Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ChemPU platform streamlines chemistry by automating kinetic measurements, bridging synthesis and analysis. It's versatile, adaptable, and facilitates precise data encoding of reactions via the Chemical Description Language (XDL). This innovation has the potential to enhance efficiency and create a valuable database of kinetic data for broader applications.







Abstract
Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time&#8208;consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; platform with on&#8208;line analytics (UV/Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system's capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer&#8208;readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isoxeniolide A
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the xenicane&#8208;type marine natural product isoxeniolide A has been accomplished through a ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis sequence and an intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction to forge the nine&#8208;membered ring as the key enabling steps. The NHK cyclization was highly diastereoselective and provided the oxabicyclo[7.4.0]tridecene core of isoxeniolide A as a single stereoisomer.







Abstract
Isoxeniolide A is a highly strained xenicane diterpenoid of marine origin. This natural product is representative for a subfamily of xenicanes incorporating an allylic hydroxy group in the nine&#8208;membered ring; members of this xenicane subfamily so far have not been targeted by total synthesis. Herein, we describe the first asymmetric total synthesis of isoxeniolide A. Key to forming the challenging E&#8208;configured cyclononene ring was a diastereoselective intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction. Other important transformations include an enzymatic desymmetrization for absolute stereocontrol, a diastereoselective cuprate addition and the use of a bifunctional vinyl silane building block. Our strategy also permits access to the enantiomer of the natural product and holds potential to access a multitude of xenicane natural products and analogs for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies.

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal chemistry&#8208;based senolytic strategy for the selective treatment of senescent cells has been developed. We demonstrate that a dihydrotetrazine&#8208;galactose conjugate (Gal&#8208;Tz) can be selectively converted into the free tetrazine by senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This strategy can be harnessed for bioorthogonal imaging as well as prodrug delivery and activation in senescent cancer cells.







Abstract
Although the clearance of senescent cells has been proven to slow down the aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is based on linking dihydrotetrazine (Tz) to a galactose (Gal) moiety that serves both as a recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and a caging group for the control of tetrazine activity. Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of a fluorescent hemicyanine and doxorubicin from a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with a 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for the selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce the degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4. Senolytic PROTACs may offer an efficient way for intervention on cell senescence thanks to their unique capacity to degrade target proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of this study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.

         <title>Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity and activity of formate over the copper electrode are dramatically promoted by the modification of cationic Gemini surfactants. Furthermore, on a Gemini surfactant modified Bi2O3 electrode, a formate FE of 91&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This improvement in formate production was attributed to the combined effects of the cations and alkyl chains present in the Gemini surfactants.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO2 electroreduction to formate. The selectivity, activity and stability of the catalysts can be all significantly enhanced by Gemini surfactant modification. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate could reach up to 96&#8201;%, and the energy efficiency (EE) could achieve 71&#8201;% over the Gemini surfactants modified Cu electrode. In addition, the Gemini surfactants modified commercial Bi2O3 nanosheets also showed an excellent catalytic performance, and the FE of formate reached 91&#8201;% with a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using the flow cell. Detailed studies demonstrated that the double quaternary ammonium cations and alkyl chains of the Gemini surfactants played a crucial role in boosting electroreduction CO2, which can not only stabilize the key intermediate HCOO* but also provide an easy access for CO2. These observations could shine light on the rational design of organic modifiers for promoted CO2 electroreduction.

Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are complex molecular assembly lines generating diverse biologically active compounds. Cryo&#8208;EM, NMR spectroscopy, XL&#8208;MS, and modeling shed light on productive interactions of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) with its ketosynthase (KS) domain. The 2.84&#8197;&#197; structure of a chain&#8208;branching rhizoxin PKS module trapped after C&#8722;C bond formation provides an important reference point in the dynamics of these versatile megasynthases.







Abstract
Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant assembly lines that produce an impressive range of biologically active compounds. However, our understanding of the structural dynamics of these megasynthases, specifically the delivery of acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound building blocks to the catalytic site of the ketosynthase (KS) domain, remains severely limited. Using a multipronged structural approach, we report details of the inter&#8208;domain interactions after C&#8722;C bond formation in a chain&#8208;branching module of the rhizoxin PKS. Mechanism&#8208;based crosslinking of an engineered module was achieved using a synthetic substrate surrogate that serves as a Michael acceptor. The crosslinked protein allowed us to identify an asymmetric state of the dimeric protein complex upon C&#8722;C bond formation by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM). The possible existence of two ACP binding sites, one of them a potential &#8220;parking position&#8221; for substrate loading, was also indicated by AlphaFold2 predictions. NMR spectroscopy showed that a transient complex is formed in solution, independent of the linker domains, and photochemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry of the standalone domains allowed us to pinpoint the interdomain interaction sites. The structural insights into a branching PKS module arrested after C&#8722;C bond formation allows a better understanding of domain dynamics and provides valuable information for the rational design of modular assembly lines.

         <title>Unlocking the Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and highly selective Ir&#8208;catalysts have been developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted acyclic enones. The mechanism and the effects of the catalyst and reaction parameters on selectivity have been unraveled by means of deuterogenation experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of tetrasubstituted olefins generating two stereocenters is still an open topic. There are only a few reports on the AH of tetrasubstituted olefins with conjugated functional groups, while this process can create useful intermediates for the subsequent elaboration of relevant end products. Most of the tetrasubstituted olefins successfully submitted to AH belong to a small number of functional classes; remarkably, the AH of tetrasubstituted acyclic enones still represents an unsolved challenge. Herein, we disclose a class of air&#8208;stable Ir&#8722;P,N catalysts, prepared in three steps from commercially available amino alcohols, that can hydrogenate, in minutes, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse acyclic tetrasubstituted enones (including exocyclic ones) with high yields and high enantioselectivities. The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an IrI/IrIII mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&#946; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition. The potential of the new catalytic systems is demonstrated by the derivatization of hydrogenation products.

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible conversion of sulfur cathodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries is realized by applying the highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 catalyst. Experimental and computational results indicate that abundant iodide ions adsorbed on ZnS nanoparticles surface regulate the d&#8208;band center of Zn, leading to atomic rearrangements, and therefore promoting the electro&#8208;oxidation of ZnS to S.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8&#8197;W&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of curved metalloporphyrin tectons via a combination of coordinative and non&#8208;covalent interactions leads to unprecedented supramolecular solids with extremely large void volumes. The intricate interaction patterns found in these solids are analogous to those in some metal&#8208; and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, offering new routes toward porous molecular crystals.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8208;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68&#8201;% to 76&#8201;%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.

         <title>Enhanced TROSY Effect in [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C] Adenosine and ATP Analogs Facilitates NMR Spectroscopy of Very Large Biological RNAs in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;19F&#8208;2&#8208;13C adenosine&#8212;large RNAs in reach of NMR. An aromatic 19F&#8208;13C isotope labelling protocol for adenosine at position 2 is introduced. The TROSY properties outcompete previous CF pyrimidine labelling Schemes and allowed dynamics, structure, and interaction characterization of 61&#8211;124&#8197;nt 20&#8211;40&#8197;kD RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Large RNAs are central to cellular functions, but characterizing such RNAs remains challenging by solution NMR. We present two labeling technologies based on [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine, which allow the incorporation of aromatic 19F&#8208;13C spin pairs. The labels when coupled with the transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) enable us to probe RNAs comprising up to 124&#8197;nucleotides. With our new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;phosphoramidite, all resonances of the human hepatitis&#8197;B virus epsilon RNA could be readily assigned. With [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine triphosphate, the 124&#8197;nt pre&#8208;miR&#8208;17&#8208;NPSL1&#8208;RNA was produced via in vitro transcription and the TROSY spectrum of this 40&#8197;kDa [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A&#8208;labeled RNA featured sharper resonances than the [2&#8208;1H, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A sample. The mutual cancelation of the chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;anisotropy and the dipole&#8208;dipole&#8208;components of TROSY&#8208;resonances leads to narrow linewidths over a wide range of molecular weights.

&lt;p&gt;2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C adenosine&#8212;large RNAs in reach of NMR. An aromatic &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope labelling protocol for adenosine at position 2 is introduced. The TROSY properties outcompete previous CF pyrimidine labelling Schemes and allowed dynamics, structure, and interaction characterization of 61&#8211;124&#8197;nt 20&#8211;40&#8197;kD RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large RNAs are central to cellular functions, but characterizing such RNAs remains challenging by solution NMR. We present two labeling technologies based on [2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-adenosine, which allow the incorporation of aromatic &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C spin pairs. The labels when coupled with the transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) enable us to probe RNAs comprising up to 124&#8197;nucleotides. With our new [2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-adenosine-phosphoramidite, all resonances of the human hepatitis&#8197;B virus epsilon RNA could be readily assigned. With [2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-adenosine triphosphate, the 124&#8197;nt pre-miR-17-NPSL1-RNA was produced via in vitro transcription and the TROSY spectrum of this 40&#8197;kDa [2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-A-labeled RNA featured sharper resonances than the [2-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-A sample. The mutual cancelation of the chemical-shift-anisotropy and the dipole-dipole-components of TROSY-resonances leads to narrow linewidths over a wide range of molecular weights. With the synthesis of a non-hydrolysable [2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-adenosine-triphosphate, we facilitate the probing of co-factor binding in kinase complexes and NMR-based inhibitor binding studies in such systems. Our labels allow a straightforward assignment for larger RNAs via a divide-and-conquer/mutational approach. The new [2-&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, 2-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-adenosine precursors are a valuable addition to the RNA NMR toolbox and will allow the study of large RNAs/RNA protein complexes in vitro and in cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Directed Evolution in Mammalian Cells Yields a Hyperefficient Pyrrolysyl tRNA for Noncanonical Amino Acid Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an optimized virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution Scheme in mammalian cells, an enhanced variant of the M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA, PyOtR, was developed. PyOtR enabled improved incorporation of many noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins expressed in mammalian cells, and enabled facile generation of cell lines stably expressing the ncAA incorporation machinery.







Abstract
Heterologous tRNAs used for noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells typically show poor activity. We recently introduced a virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution strategy (VADER) that can enrich improved tRNA mutants from na&#239;ve libraries in mammalian cells. However, VADER was limited to processing only a few thousand mutants; the inability to screen a larger sequence space precluded the identification of highly active variants with distal synergistic mutations. Here, we report VADER2.0, which can process significantly larger mutant libraries. It also employs a novel library design, which maintains base&#8208;pairing between distant residues in the stem regions, allowing us to pack a higher density of functional mutants within a fixed sequence space. VADER2.0 enabled simultaneous engineering of the entire acceptor stem of M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA (tRNAPyl), leading to a remarkably improved variant, which facilitates more efficient incorporation of a wider range of ncAAs, and enables facile development of viral vectors and stable cell&#8208;lines for ncAA mutagenesis.

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a viscosity&#8208;sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe, ER&#8208;ZS, which can monitor ER stress&#8208;induced viscosity changes in real time. ER&#8208;ZS is also an excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia type&#8197;I photosensitizer that activates tumor cell pyroptosis by damaging the ER pathway.







Abstract
The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type&#8197;I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2&#8201;% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.

The spiro[3.3]heptane core, with the non&#8208;coplanar exit vectors, was shown to be a saturated benzene bioisostere. This scaffold was incorporated into the anticancer drug sonidegib (instead of the meta&#8208;benzene), the anticancer drug vorinostat (instead of the phenyl ring), and the anesthetic drug benzocaine (instead of the para&#8208;benzene). The patent&#8208;free saturated analogs obtained showed a high potency in the corresponding biological assays.

         <title>A Double&#8208;ligand Chelating Strategy to Iron Complex Anolytes with Ultrahigh Cyclability for Aqueous Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy was proposed to design Fe(TEA)MM complex as anolyte materials with high binding energy, robust coordination structure, highly electrochemical activity and good reversibility. All iron flow batteries based on Fe(TEA)MM anolytes and Fe(CN)6 catholytes reach a low capital cost of $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 and record&#8208;breaking cycling stability without detectable energy efficiency and capacity decay during 1400 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large&#8208;scale and long&#8208;term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge&#8208;discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe3+ and Fe2+, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100&#8201;% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 (e.g., 20&#8197;h duration), cheaper than Li&#8208;ion battery and vanadium flow battery.

     alt="A Double-ligand Chelating Strategy to Iron Complex Anolytes with Ultrahigh Cyclability for Aqueous Iron Flow Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A double-ligand chelating strategy was proposed to design Fe(TEA)MM complex as anolyte materials with high binding energy, robust coordination structure, highly electrochemical activity and good reversibility. All iron flow batteries based on Fe(TEA)MM anolytes and Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; catholytes reach a low capital cost of $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and record-breaking cycling stability without detectable energy efficiency and capacity decay during 1400 cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous all-iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large-scale and long-term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2-methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge-discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100&#8201;% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g., 20&#8197;h duration), cheaper than Li-ion battery and vanadium flow battery. This double-ligand chelating strategy not only solves the current problems faced by AIFBs, but also provides an insight for further improving the cycling stability of other flow batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconstructed Bismuth Oxide through in situ Carbonation by Carbonate&#8208;containing Electrolyte for Highly Active Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonate in the electrolyte was found to affect the chemical evolution of the catalyst and further lead to changes in the catalyst performance. Especially, the Bi2O3 with weak CO32&#8722; adsorption underwent an in situ carbonation to form surface Bi2O2CO3 layer in CO2 purged KOH electrolyte. The reconstructed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as a highly active structure and promoted the formation of formate.







Abstract
The catalyst&#8208;reconstruction makes it challenging to clarify the practical active sites and unveil the actual reaction mechanism during the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, currently the impact of the electrolyte microenvironment in which the electrolyte is in contact with the catalyst is overlooked and might induce a chemical evolution, thus confusing the reconstruction process and mechanism. In this work, the carbonate adsorption properties of metal oxides were investigated, and the mechanism of how the electrolyte carbonate affect the chemical evolution of catalysts were discussed. Notably, Bi2O3 with weak carbonate adsorption underwent a chemical reconstruction to form the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ characterizations unveiled the formation mechanism of the heterostructure. The in situ formed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as the highly active structure for CO2RR, achieving a formate Faradaic efficiency of 98.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8 Vvs RHE. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the significantly tuned p&#8208;orbit electrons of the Bi sites in Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 optimized the adsorption of the intermediate and lowered the energy barrier for the formation of *OCHO. This work elucidates the mechanism of electrolyte microenvironment for affecting catalyst reconstruction, which contributes to the understanding of reconstruction process and clarification of the actual catalytic structure.

         <title>Binary All&#8208;polymer Solar Cells with a Perhalogenated&#8208;Thiophene&#8208;Based Solid Additive Surpass 18&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric perhalogenated thiophenes were reported as solid additives to optimize the morphological characters of all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). Among them, power conversion efficiency over 18&#8201;% and long&#8208;term thermal stability (T90 lifetime is 550&#8197;hours) were realized for SA&#8208;T1&#8208;treated binary APSC, providing a possibility for obtaining high&#8208;performance APSCs.







Abstract
Morphological control of all&#8208;polymer blends is quintessential yet challenging in fabricating high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Recently, solid additives (SAs) have been approved to be capable in tuning the morphology of polymer: small&#8208;molecule blends improving the performance and stability of devices. Herein, three perhalogenated thiophenes, which are 3,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,5&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T1), 2,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T2), and 2,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;4,5&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T3), were adopted as SAs to optimize the performance of all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). For the blend of PM6 and PY&#8208;IT, benefitting from the intermolecular interactions between perhalogenated thiophenes and polymers, the molecular packing properties could be finely regulated after introducing these SAs. In situ UV/Vis measurement revealed that these SAs could assist morphological character evolution in the all&#8208;polymer blend, leading to their optimal morphologies. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT, all SA&#8208;treated binary devices displayed enhanced power conversion efficiencies of 17.4&#8211;18.3&#8201;% with obviously elevated short&#8208;circuit current densities and fill factors. To our knowledge, the PCE of 18.3&#8201;% for SA&#8208;T1&#8208;treated binary ranks the highest among all binary APSCs to date. Meanwhile, the universality of SA&#8208;T1 in other all&#8208;polymer blends is demonstrated with unanimously improved device performance. This work provide a new pathway in realizing high&#8208;performance APSCs.

         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>

It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen waste species in water. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime, an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide over copper catalysts under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen species. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide for the first time over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2 and wastewater.

A versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enables facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicks catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2 via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme.







Abstract
A nanozyme with neighboring single&#8208;iron sites (Fe2&#8208;SAzyme) was introduced as a bioinspired catalase mimic, featuring excellent activity under varied conditions, twice as high as that of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme and ultrahigh H2O2 affinity as that of bioenzymes. Surprisingly, the interatomic spacing tuning between adjacent iron sites also suppressed the competitive peroxidase pathway, remarkably increasing the catalase/peroxidase selectivity up to ~6 times compared to Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. This dramatically switched the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating (i.e. Fe1&#8208;SAzymes, preferably mimicking peroxidase) to scavenging ROS (i.e. Fe2&#8208;SAzymes, dominantly mimicking catalase). Theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that the pairwise single&#8208;iron sites may serve as a robust molecular tweezer to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption. The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale, but with no obvious scale&#8208;up effect for both structures and performances.

         <title>Signal Amplification and Near&#8208;Infrared Translation of Enzymatic Reactions by Nanosensors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ELISA substrates and products modulate the near&#8208;infrared fluorescence of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) modified with specific (bio)polymers. The affinity of these nanosensors for the analyte increases the effective local concentration compared to normal absorption measurements. This causes a signal enhancement, which improves the readout of enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Enzymatic reactions are used to detect analytes in a range of biochemical methods. To measure the presence of an analyte, the enzyme is conjugated to a recognition unit and converts a substrate into a (colored) product that is detectable by visible (VIS) light. Thus, the lowest enzymatic turnover that can be detected sets a limit on sensitivity. Here, we report that substrates and products of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase change the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence of (bio)polymer modified single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). They translate a VIS signal into a beneficial NIR signal. Moreover, the affinity of the nanosensors leads to a higher effective local concentration of the reactants. This causes a non&#8208;linear sensor&#8208;based signal amplification and translation (SENSAT). We find signal enhancement up to &#8776;120x for the HRP substrate p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPD), which means that reactions below the limit of detection in the VIS can be followed in the NIR (&#8776;1000&#8197;nm). The approach is also applicable to other substrates such as 3,3&#8242;&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An adsorption&#8208;based theoretical model fits the observed signals and corroborates the sensor&#8208;based enhancement mechanism. This approach can be used to amplify signals, translate them into the NIR and increase sensitivity of biochemical assays.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacenes were synthesized on Au(111) and their properties were characterized by combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many body calculations. The study confirmed the open&#8208;shell diradical character and demonstrated that the magnitude of the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap is affected by the proximity of the surface as well as a dynamic electron correlation.







Abstract
The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126&#8197;meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many&#8208;body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8722;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV was prepared by a solvothermal method for efficient sonodynamic therapy. Abundant oxygen vacancies were introduced into the nanobrush through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction reaction and can serve as charge traps to inhibit e&#8722;&#8208;h+ recombination. The almost ideal band structures of the nanobrush endow it with the potential to simultaneously produce 1O2, &#8901;O2&#8722;, and &#8901;OH under ultrasound irradiation.







Abstract
With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8208;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.

This study describes the synthesis of polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein assemblies with tunable microstructures, including single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and doughnut&#8208;shaped hierarchical&#8208;structured protein aggregates. The as&#8208;prepared protein aggregates display morphology&#8208;dependent cell uptake.







Abstract
The construction of variable structured multi&#8208;protein nano&#8208;assemblies is of great interest for the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutic systems. This study showcases the synthesis of polymer&#8208;protein assemblies with tunable structure like single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and other hierarchical&#8208;structured assemblies by utilizing a dynamic template&#8208;assistant intermittent&#8208;assembly approach. The generalization of the methodology helps the protein assemblies to gain notable functional complexity. And we demonstrate compelling evidence highlighting the substantial impact of the topological morphology of protein nanoaggregates on their cellular uptake capacity.

         <title>Stereoselective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides Using Salen Aluminum Catalysts: A Route to High&#8208;Isotactic Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the stereoselective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6&#8197;kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a isotactic crystalline poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Polythioesters are important sustainable polymers with broad applications. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (SCAs) can afford polythioesters with functional groups that are typically difficult to prepare by ROP of thiolactones. Typical methods involving organocatalysts, like dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et3N), have been plagued by uncontrolled polymerization, including epimerization for most SCAs resulting in the loss of isotacticity. Here, we report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the selective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6&#8197;kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a isotactic crystalline poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6&#8201;&#176;C. Effective ligand tailoring governs the binding affinity between the sulfide chain&#8208;end and the metal center, thereby maintaining the activity of organometallic catalysts and reducing the occurrence of epimerization reactions.

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eighteen nitroxide biradicals for DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR are compared at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. Among the best performing radicals, the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, works well in both organic and aqueous solvents, making it a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.







Abstract
We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall sensitivity across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides high sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Base Sites for Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes on Ceria Nanorods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria nanorods are effective for additive&#8208;free synthesis of azoxy&#8208;aromatics by the transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with ethanol as the hydrogen donor. Oxygen vacancies (Ov) and basic sites play a synergistic role, where Ov serve as the sites for adsorption and activation of ethanol as well as nitroarenes, which greatly decreases the activation energy of hydrogen atom transfer from &#945;&#8722;Csp3&#8722;H in ethanol to nitro groups.







Abstract
CeO2 nanorod based catalysts for the base&#8208;free synthesis of azoxy&#8208;aromatics via transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with ethanol as hydrogen donor have been synthesized and investigated. The oxygen vacancies (Ov) and base sites are critical for their excellent catalytic properties. The Ov, i.e., undercoordinated Ce cations, serve as the sites to activate ethanol and nitroarenes by lowering the energy barrier to transfer hydrogen from &#945;&#8722;Csp3&#8722;H in ethanol to the nitro group coupling it to the redox reactions between Ce3+ and Ce4+. At the same time, the base sites catalyze the condensation step to selectively produce azoxy&#8208;aromatics. The catalytic route opens a much improved way to use non&#8208;noble metal oxides without additives for the selective functional group reduction and coupling reactions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Species Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) thin films are obtained by reconstructing perovskite surface with GASCN/NaSCN. This surface reconstruction can repair surface defects of PNC, maintain the integrity of crystal structure, and suppress F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, thus enabling highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) solution has exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the luminance would be severely quenched when the PNC solution is assembled into thin films due to the agglomeration and fusion of NCs caused by the exfoliation of surface ligands and non&#8208;radiative F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from small to large particle sizes, which seriously affected the performances of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we used Guanidine thiocyanate (GASCN) and Sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) to achieve effective CsPbI3 PNC surface reconstruction. Due to the strong coordination ability of these small molecules with the anions and cations on the surface of the PNCs, they can provide strong surface protection against PNC fusion during centrifugal purification process and repair the surface defects of PNCs, so that the original uniform size distribution of PNCs can be maintained and FRET between close&#8208;packed PNC films is effectively suppressed, which allows the emission characteristics of the films to be preserved. As a result, highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free high&#8208;quality PNC thin films are obtained, with PLQY as high as 95.1&#8201;%, far exceeding that of the original film, and corresponding LEDs exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Stabilization of NH&#8722; Group Adjacent to Naked Silicon(II) Atom in Base Stabilized Aminosilylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the isolation of the first examples of free aminosilylenes 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b having &#8722;NH group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Aminosilylenes showed unique reactivity upon heating; an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation with 1&#8201;a afforded cyclic silazane, whereas 1&#8201;b showed a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to afford rare silanimine.







Abstract
Aminosilylene, comprising reactive NH&#8722; and Si(II) sites next to each other, is an intriguing class of compounds due to its ability to show diverse reactivity. However, stabilizing the reactive NH&#8722; group next to the free Si(II) atom is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report the first examples of base stabilized free aminosilylenes Ar*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;a) and Mes*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;b) (Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl and Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl), tolerating a NH&#8722; group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Remarkably, 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibited interesting differences in their reactivity upon heating. With 1&#8201;a, an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of one of the benzhydryl methine hydrogen atoms to the Si(II) atom produced the five&#8208;membered cyclic silazane 2. However, with 1&#8201;b, a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to the Si(II) atom afforded a silanimine 3, with a hydride ligand attached to an unsaturated silicon atom. Further, the coordination capabilities of 1&#8201;a were also tested with Ru(II) and Fe(0) precursors. Treatments of 1&#8201;a with [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 led to the isolation of a &#951;6&#8208;arene tethered complex [RuCl2{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene}] (4), whereas with the Fe(CO)5 precursor a Fe(0) complex [Fe(CO)4{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si}] (5) was obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the structural, bonding, and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;5.

         <title>Thermally Healable Electrolyte&#8208;Electrode Interface for Sustainable Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by jellies, we design a dynamically healable hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can effectively repair the inherent non&#8208;conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to form a stable conformal solid&#8208;solid interface.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8208;ion batteries using hydrogel electrolytes show great potential in energy storage devices owing to their intrinsic safety, fewer side reactions and wide electrochemical windows. However, the dendrite issues on the zinc anodes cannot be fundamentally eliminated and the intrinsic anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspace is rarely investigated. Here, we design a dynamically healable gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can construct a conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and further evolve into a stable solid&#8208;solid interface by in situ solidification. The unique helical gelatin chain structure provides a uniform channel for zinc ion transport by the bridging effect of sulfate groups. As a consequence, the dynamically healable interface enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes and repeatedly repairs the anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspaces by the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition of gelatin electrolyte to retain long&#8208;lasting protection for sustainable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Accelerating the Reaction Kinetics of CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Synergistic Effect between Cation and Aprotic Solvent on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of cation and aprotic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) in a neutral electrolyte can improve the selectivity of C2+ products for CO2 reduction reaction. Among them, the synergistic effect not only enhances C&#8722;C coupling, but also decreases the water network connectivity &#8208; which suppresses C1 product formation and hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is an important and highly challenging topic. In this work, we propose and validate an effective strategy to improve C2+ selectivity on Cu electrodes, by introducing a synergistic effect between cation (Na+) and aprotic solvent (DMSO) to the electrolyte. Based on constant potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first revealed that Na+ facilitates C&#8722;C coupling while inhibits CH3OH/CH4 products via reducing the water network connectivity near the electrode. Furthermore, the water network connectivity was further decreased by introducing an aprotic solvent DMSO, leading to suppression of both C1 production and hydrogen evolution reaction with minimal effect on *OCCO* hydrogenation. The synergistic effect enhancing C2 selectivity was also experimentally verified through electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the Faradaic efficiency of C2 increases from 9.3&#8201;% to 57&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA/cm2 under a mixed electrolyte of NaHCO3 and DMSO compared to a pure NaHCO3, which can significantly enhance the selectivity of the C2 product. Therefore, our discovery provides an effective electrolyte&#8208;based strategy for tuning CO2RR selectivity through modulating the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.

         <title>Pivotal Role of Geometry Regulation on O&#8722;O Bond Formation Mechanism of Bimetallic Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does proximity make a difference? The progression of O&#8722;O bond formation through an oxyl/hydroxide coupling in water oxidation catalyzed by Cu2 complexes is greatly influenced by the catalyst's geometry.







Abstract
In this study, we highlight the impact of catalyst geometry on the formation of O&#8722;O bonds in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. A series of Cu2 complexes with diverse linkers are designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Interestingly, the catalytic performance of these Cu2 complexes is enhanced as their molecular skeletons become more rigid, which contrasts with the behavior observed in our previous investigation with Fe2 analogs. Moreover, mechanistic studies reveal that the reactivity of the bridging O atom results in distinct pathways for O&#8722;O bond formation in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. In Cu2 systems, the coupling takes place between a terminal CuIII&#8722;OH and a bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8901; radical. Whereas in Fe2 systems, it involves the coupling of two terminal Fe&#8211;oxo entities. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity analysis uncovers the spatial geometric prerequisites for the coupling of the terminal OH with the bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8901; radical, ultimately leading to the O&#8722;O bond formation. Overall, this study emphasizes the critical role of precisely adjusting the spatial geometry of catalysts to align with the O&#8722;O bonding pathway.

Moreover, mechanistic studies reveal that the reactivity of the bridging O atom results in distinct pathways for O&#8722;O bond formation in Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts. In Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems, the coupling takes place between a terminal Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;OH and a bridging &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;O&#8901; radical. Whereas in Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems, it involves the coupling of two terminal Fe&#8211;oxo entities. Furthermore, an in-depth structure&#8211;activity analysis uncovers the spatial geometric prerequisites for the coupling of the terminal OH with the bridging &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;O&#8901; radical, ultimately leading to the O&#8722;O bond formation. Overall, this study emphasizes the critical role of precisely adjusting the spatial geometry of catalysts to align with the O&#8722;O bonding pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Flexible Synthesis of Polypropionates via Diastereodivergent Reductive Ring&#8208;Opening of Trisubstituted Secondary Glycidols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our novel approach towards polypropionate synthesis features stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks. The key&#8208;step of diversification is accomplished by mechanism&#8208;control of the diastereodivergent reductive opening at the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom that occurs with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Polypropionates, characterized by their alternating sequence of stereocenters bearing methyl&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;groups, are structurally diverse natural products of utmost importance.[1] Herein, we introduce a novel concept approach towards polypropionate synthesis featuring a diastereodivergent reductive epoxide&#8208;opening as a key step. Readily available and stereochemically uniform trisubstituted sec&#8208;glycidols serve as branching points for the highly selective synthesis of all isomers of polypropionate building blocks with three or more consecutive stereocenters. Stereodiversification is accomplished by an unprecedented mechanism&#8208;control over the stereochemically complementary modification of the epoxide's tertiary C&#8208;atom with excellent control of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Since our method is not only suited for the preparation of specific targets but also for compound libraries, it will have a great impact on polypropionate synthesis.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate ROS to stimulate the TRPA1 channel and realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. At the same time, photothermo&#8208;controlled NO generation could open the RyR channel in the ER and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Through the combination of dual channels, Ca2+ overload would occur in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Designing reactive calcium&#8208;based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca2+ are either overactive incapable of on&#8208;demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca2+&#8208;regulating channels, a photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca2+ from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca2+ overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co&#8208;load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN&#8208;6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell&#8208;targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN&#8208;6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ influx and release could enable Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.

         <title>Patient&#8208;derived Immunocompetent Tumor Organoids: A Platform for Chemotherapy Evaluation in the Context of T&#8208;cell Recognition
</title>

A patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model to rapidly, precisely and individually evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing is presented. This study bridges the gap between clinical translation and basic research in metalloimmunology, accelerating drug discovery for cancer immunotherapy and facilitating individualized precision medicine.







Abstract
Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these, Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent, demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.

         <title>Supramolecular Hydrolase Mimics in Equilibrium and Kinetically Trapped States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic peptides have been shown to undergo pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly into kinetically trapped and thermodynamic equilibrium structures, which displayed distinct supramolecular behaviors and catalytic activity. The key role of static and dynamic supramolecular structures in dictating substrate&#8208;peptide interaction and the involvement of interfacial water in catalytic hydrolysis reactions is highlighted.







Abstract
The folding of proteins into intricate three&#8208;dimensional structures to achieve biological functions, such as catalysis, is governed by both kinetic and thermodynamic controls. The quest to design artificial enzymes using minimalist peptides seeks to emulate supramolecular structures existing in a catalytically active state. Drawing inspiration from the nuanced process of protein folding, our study explores the enzyme&#8208;like activity of amphiphilic peptide nanosystems in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states, featuring the formation of supramolecular nanofibrils and nanosheets. In contrast to thermodynamically stable nanosheets, the kinetically trapped nanofibrils exhibit dynamic characteristics (e.g., rapid molecular exchange and relatively weak intermolecular packing), resulting in a higher hydrolase&#8208;mimicking activity. We emphasize that a supramolecular microenvironment characterized by an optimal local polarity, microviscosity, and &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonding is conducive to both substrate binding and ester bond hydrolysis. Our work underscores the pivotal role of both thermodynamic and kinetic control in impacting biomimetic catalysis and sheds a light on the development of artificial enzymes.

         <title>Structural Distortion in the Wadsley&#8208;Roth Niobium Molybdenum Oxide Phase Triggering Extraordinarily Stable Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relief of octahedral distortion in niobium molybdenum oxides during cycling enhances the structural stability of battery active materials, resulting in an exceptional cycle lifespan of 15,000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This mechanism offers new insights into stabilizing the material structures of Wadsley&#8208;Roth oxides for significantly prolonged battery life.







Abstract
Wadsley&#8208;Roth niobium oxide phases have attracted extensive research interest recently as promising battery anodes. We have synthesized the niobium&#8208;molybdenum oxide shear phase (Nb, Mo)13O33 with superior electrochemical Li&#8208;ion storage performance, including an ultralong cycling lifespan of at least 15000&#8197;cycles. During electrochemical cycling, a reversible single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution reaction with lithiated intermediate solid solutions is demonstrated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, with the valence and short&#8208;range structural changes of the electrode probed by in situ Nb and Mo K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. This work reveals that the superior stability of niobium molybdenum oxides is underpinned by changes in octahedral distortion during electrochemical reactions, and we report an in&#8208;depth understanding of how this stabilizes the oxide structure during cycling with implications for future long&#8208;life battery material design.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrophobic Tri&#8208;layer Interface Rendered Mechanically Graded Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface is developed through the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte design to create stable electrode/electrolyte interface. The OTF&#8208; rich interface facilitates the formation of mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface. As a result, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enabled zinc metal battery stable operation at practical condition and under wide temperature range.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery is promising as grid scale energy storage device, but hindered by the instable electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we report the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte for aqueous zinc metal batteries. The lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte creates the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface assembled by first two layers of hydrophobic OTF&#8722; and EMIM+ and third layer of loosely attached water, beyond the classical Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern theory based electrochemical double layer. By taking advantage of the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enables a wide electrochemical working window (2.93&#8197;V) with relatively high zinc ion conductivity (17.3&#8197;mS/cm). Furthermore, the anion crowding interface facilitates the OTF&#8722; decomposition chemistry to create the mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface layer to simultaneously suppress the dendrite formation and maintain the mechanical stability. In this way, the lean&#8208;water based ionic liquid electrolyte realizes the ultralong cyclability of over 10000 cycles at 20&#8197;A/g and at practical condition of N/P ratio of 1.5, the cumulated areal capacity reach 1.8&#8197;Ah/cm2, which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc metal battery performance. Our work highlights the importance of the stable electrode/electrolyte interface stability, which would be practical for building high energy grid scale zinc&#8208;ion battery.

         <title>Rapid Synthesis of Chiral Figure&#8208;Eight Macrocycles Using a Preorganized Natural Product&#8208;Based Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral D2&#8208;symmetric Figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, which exhibits bright CPL (glum=0.011, &#934;fl=0.74, BCPL=480), was efficiently synthesized using a versatile C2&#8208;symmetric natural product&#8208;based manifold with a preorganized conformation. This rapid and modular synthetic platform allows flexible and precise tuning of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores in shape&#8208;persistent figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.







Abstract
Chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles are promising scaffolds for amplifying the chiroptical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. By harnessing the inherent and adaptable conformational dynamics of a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric bispyrrolidinoindoline (BPI) manifold, we developed an enantio&#8208;divergent modular synthetic platform to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution. Notably, a 32&#8208;membered figure&#8208;eight macrocycle showed excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL: |glum|=1.1&#215;10&#8722;2) complemented by a robust emission quantum yield (&#934;fl=0.74), to achieve outstanding CPL brightness (BCPL: &#1013;&#215;&#934;fl&#215;|glum|/2=480). Using quadruple Sonogashira couplings, this versatile synthetic platform enables precise adjustments of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores. Our synthetic strategy offers a streamlined and systematic approach to significantly enhance BCPL values for a variety of chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8722;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>

         <dc:description>
P450 51 enzymes demethylate sterols, releasing formic acid (DCOOH). Analysis of the DCOOH by&#8208;product enables the mechanistic discrimination of the contribution(s) of Compound 0 (Cpd 0) and Compound I (Cpd I) to catalysis. When enzyme reactions were run under 18O2 (red), &gt;50&#8201;% of the DCOOH yielded contained one atom of 18O (for all P450 51 enzymes tested), indicative of the major contribution of Cpd 0 in 24,25&#8208;dihydrolanosterol C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, for example, with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved three&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8722;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#8722;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of 18O incorporation into formic acid from 18O2 provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88&#8201;% 18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#8722; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen atom 3.5&#8197;&#197; away from the heme iron atom. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one 18O atom but 14&#8201;% of the formic acid product with two 18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8211;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.

         <dc:description>
A versatile modular synthetic platform was developed to generate chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles exhibiting excellent circularly polarized luminescence, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa, Junpei Yuasa, and Hiroki Oguri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202318548). A preorganized C2&#8208;symmetric scaffold was designed based on natural products such as chimonanthine, isolated from Chimonanthus praecox, to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 9/2024)</title>

The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to 1000 grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicked catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme. The precise manipulation of neighboring atomic distance dramatically switched the activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating to scavenging ROS, as reported by Hongyu Chen, Hongbing Ji et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316779).

An unexpected regiospecificity in topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization is reported by Kana&#8197;M. Sureshan et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202316513). Based on Schmidt's postulates for topochemical reactions, both the reactivity and the structure of the product were predicted. While the monomer packing predicted a regiospecific reaction to form a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer, surprisingly, it formed an unexpected 1,5&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer as a result of massive molecular motion before the TEAC reaction.

         <title>Kinetic Asymmetry and Directionality of Nonequilibrium Molecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratchet mechanisms allow external energy to drive pumping or directional motion on the ground state. An energy ratchet uses external modulation to destroy correlations present at equilibrium and an information ratchet uses catalysis and allosteric interactions to create correlations between the energy profile and occupancy of a binding site. A key design principle is kinetic asymmetry&#8212;a difference in barrier heights in the two states of the energy profile.







Abstract
Scientists have long been fascinated by the biomolecular machines in living systems that process energy and information to sustain life. The first synthetic molecular rotor capable of performing repeated 360&#176; rotations due to a combination of photo&#8208; and thermally activated processes was reported in 1999. The progress in designing different molecular machines in the intervening years has been remarkable, with several outstanding examples appearing in the last few years. Despite the synthetic accomplishments, there remains confusion regarding the fundamental design principles by which the motions of molecules can be controlled, with significant intellectual tension between mechanical and chemical ways of thinking about and describing molecular machines. A thermodynamically consistent analysis of the kinetics of several molecular rotors and pumps shows that while light driven rotors operate by a power&#8208;stroke mechanism, kinetic asymmetry&#8212;the relative heights of energy barriers&#8212;is the sole determinant of the directionality of catalysis driven machines. Power&#8208;strokes&#8212;the relative depths of energy wells&#8212;play no role whatsoever in determining the sign of the directionality. These results, elaborated using trajectory thermodynamics and the nonequilibrium pump equality, show that kinetic asymmetry governs the response of many non&#8208;equilibrium chemical phenomena.

         <title>Exploring Peptido&#8208;Nanocomposites in the Context of Amyloid Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review concerns the design principles, working mechanisms and application of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites against amyloidosis, a hallmark of amyloid diseases.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides are a major class of pharmaceutical drugs owing to their target&#8208;binding specificity as well as their versatility in inhibiting aberrant protein&#8208;protein interactions associated with human pathologies. Within the realm of amyloid diseases, the use of peptides and peptidomimetics tailor&#8208;designed to overcome amyloidogenesis has been an active research endeavor since the late 90s. In more recent years, incorporating nanoparticles for enhancing the biocirculation and delivery of peptide drugs has emerged as a frontier in nanomedicine, and nanoparticles have further demonstrated a potency against amyloid aggregation and cellular inflammation to rival strategies employing small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. Despite these efforts, however, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry, characteristics and function of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites is lacking, and a systematic analysis of such strategy for combating a range of amyloid pathogeneses is missing. Here we review the history, principles and evolving chemistry of constructing peptido&#8208;nanocomposites from bottom up and discuss their future application against amyloid diseases that debilitate a significant portion of the global population.

         <title>Photochromic Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of photoswitchable moieties into biological macromolecules has emerged as a promising approach to manipulate and study complex processes in living organisms. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and provide an overview of design principles, synthetic strategies, analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8211;property relationships and applications.







Abstract
Photochromism is a reversible phenomenon wherein a material undergoes a change in color upon exposure to light. In organic photochromes, this effect often results from light&#8208;induced isomerization reactions, leading to alterations in either the spatial orientation or electronic properties of the photochrome. The incorporation of photochromic moieties into biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, has become a prevalent approach to render these biomolecules responsive to light stimuli. Utilizing light as a trigger for the manipulation of biomolecular structure and function offers numerous advantages compared to other stimuli, such as chemical or electrical treatments, due to its non&#8208;invasive nature. Consequently, light proves particularly advantageous in cellular and tissue applications. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the design principles of different classes of photochromes, synthetic strategies, critical analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8211;property relationships. The applications of photochromic nucleic acid derivatives encompass diverse domains, ranging from the precise photoregulation of gene expression to the controlled modulation of the three&#8208;dimensional structures of oligonucleotides and the development of DNA&#8208;based fluorescence modulators. Moreover, we present a future perspective on potential modifications and applications.

         <title>Colloidal Self&#8208;Assembly: From Passive to Active Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal self&#8208;assembly allows for the formation of diverse intricate structures assembling in natural systems. This Minireview compares the key similarities and differences between passive and active systems and highlights the unique collective behaviors and emergent properties that arise in active systems.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly fundamentally implies the organization of small sub&#8208;units into large structures or patterns without the intervention of specific local interactions. This process is commonly observed in nature, occurring at various scales ranging from atomic/molecular assembly to the formation of complex biological structures. Colloidal particles may serve as micrometer&#8208;scale surrogates for studying assembly, particularly for the poorly understood kinetic and dynamic processes at the atomic scale. Recent advances in colloidal self&#8208;assembly have enabled the programmable creation of novel materials with tailored properties. We here provide an overview and comparison of both passive and active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, with a discussion on the energy landscape and interactions governing both types. In the realm of passive colloidal assembly, many impressive and important structures have been realized, including colloidal molecules, one&#8208;dimensional chains, two&#8208;dimensional lattices, and three&#8208;dimensional crystals. In contrast, active colloidal self&#8208;assembly, driven by optical, electric, chemical, or other fields, involves more intricate dynamic processes, offering more flexibility and potential new applications. A comparative analysis underscores the critical distinctions between passive and active colloidal assemblies, highlighting the unique collective behaviors emerging in active systems. These behaviors encompass collective motion, motility&#8208;induced phase segregation, and exotic properties arising from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics. Through this comparison, we aim to identify the future opportunities in active assembly research, which may suggest new application domains.

The development of new methods for enantioselective reactions that generate stereogenic centres within molecules is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. In this minireview we highlight the recent advances in enantioselective main group catalysis of the p&#8208;block elements including boron, phosphorus, bismuth and aluminium.







Abstract
The development of new methods for enantioselective reactions that generate stereogenic centres within molecules are a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Typically, metal catalysts bearing chiral ligands as well as chiral organocatalysts have been employed for the enantioselective synthesis of organic compounds. In this review, we highlight the recent advances in main group catalysis for enantioselective reactions using the p&#8208;block elements (boron, aluminium, phosphorus, bismuth) as a complementary and sustainable approach to generate chiral molecules. Several of these catalysts benefit in terms of high abundance, low toxicity, high selectivity, and excellent reactivity. This minireview summarises the utilisation of chiral p&#8208;block element catalysts for asymmetric reactions to generate value&#8208;added compounds.

Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced Pd catalysis has emerged as a promising subfield of photocatalysis. The hybrid nature of Pd radical species has enabled a wide array of radical&#8208;based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional Pd chemistry. In parallel to the ongoing pursuit of alternative, readily available radical precursors, notable discoveries have demonstrated that photoexcitation can alter not only oxidative addition but also other elementary steps. This Minireview highlights the recent progress in this area.

&lt;p&gt;Visible light-induced Pd catalysis typically operates through the transfer of a single electron. The resulting hybrid Pd radical species can participate in a range of radical-based transformations otherwise challenging or unknown via conventional 2-electron processes.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Engineered Large&#8208;Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of large&#8208;area continuous COF films with controllable thickness and the patterned growth of films are achieved by solid&#8208;liquid interface engineering. The COF films have high crystalline quality and photoelectrochemical performance. When used as an active material for synaptic devices, they show excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties and successfully simulate biological synaptic functions.







Abstract
Constructing uniform covalent organic framework (COF) film on substrates for electronic devices is highly desirable. Here, a simple and mild strategy is developed to prepare them by polymerization on a solid&#8208;liquid interface. The universality of the method is confirmed by the successful preparation of five COF films with different microstructures. These films have large lateral size, controllable thickness, and high crystalline quality. And COF patterns can also be directly achieved on substrates via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface engineering, which is in favor of preparing device array. For application studies, the PyTTA&#8208;TPA (PyTTA: 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene and TPA: terephthalaldehyde) COF film has a high photoresponsivity of 59.79&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 at 420&#8197;nm for photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection. When employed as an active material for optoelectronic synaptic devices for the first attempt, it shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties such as short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and the conversion of STP to LTP, which can be used to simulate biological synaptic functions.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100&#8201;% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice Cl&#8722; cyclic process of Co2(OH)3Cl was demonstrated to facilitate photoelectrochemical Cl&#8722; oxidative Cl2 generation in a salt electrolyte. The on&#8208;site produced HClO, by reacting Cl2 with H2O, can be a mediator to oxidize various alkenes to generate the corresponding epoxides with conversion ratios and selectivities of almost 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl&#8722; of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and be spontaneously recovered by Cl&#8722; of a salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100&#8201;% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8722;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120&#8197;hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Initiated Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Polythiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Block Copolymer into Erect Micellar Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of polythiophene&#8208;base block copolymer and further decoration of Pt nanoparticles lead to facile construction of highly erect conjugated micellar brushes on various substrates. Moreover, successive patterned immobilization of two types of seed micelles followed by independently surface&#8208;initiated CDSA allows the growth of patterned dual&#8208;micellar brushes on the same substrate.







Abstract
Nanostructured conjugated polymers are of widespread interest due to their broad applications in organic optoelectronic devices, biomedical sensors and other fields. However, the alignment of conjugated nanostructures perpendicular to a surface remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to directly self&#8208;assemble a poly(3&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT&#8208;based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700&#8197;nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the P3EHT&#8208;based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS&#8208;based micellar brush on the same surface without any significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site&#8208;selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry was combined with in&#8208;source fragmentation to visualize fragmentation pathways of biopolymers in a three&#8208;dimensional data domain (Precursor m/z, Product m/z, Intensity). By connecting the experimental points in a stairstep pattern, with the diagonal line where the precursor and product m/z values are equal defining the edge of each stair, the sequence of the biopolymer could be reconstructed.







Abstract
Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharide or peptide ions prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.

A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid&#8208;state Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are attractive due to their greener reaction conditions, and ability to yield unique products. Such reactions are feasible when the reacting groups are pre&#8208;organized in the crystal. We present a crystal that avoids a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement but reacts after a massive molecular motion leading to an unexpected product. This alerts that one has to be cautious in predicting the topochemical reactions based on crystal packing.







Abstract
We designed a proline&#8208;derived monomer with azide and alkene functional groups to enable topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization. In its crystal, the monomer forms supramolecular helices along the &#8216;a&#8217; axis through various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Along the &#8216;c&#8217; axis, the molecules arrange themselves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail in a wave&#8208;like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti&#8208;parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.

         <title>Sulfonium Rearrangements Enable the Direct Preparation of Sulfenyl Imidinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;accelerated sulfonium rearrangement using simple amides establishes a direct route to sulfenyl imidinium salts, bearing two distinct electrophilic centers and three contiguous stereocenters, formed with high selectivity. Concurrently, access to versatile 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl or sulfonolactone motifs is established.







Abstract
Sulfenyl imidinium salts are a virtually unexplored class of intermediates in organic chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate how sulfonium rearrangements can be deployed to access these versatile synthetic intermediates, bearing three contiguous (and congested) stereogenic centers, with high levels of selectivity. The synthetic value of the scaffold was unraveled by selective transformations into a range of building blocks, including 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives and sulfonolactones.

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation highly oxidized metal species in C(sp)&#8208;rich graphdiyne, nitrogen can selectively and efficiently be converted into *NO, the key intermediate towards nitric acid synthesis. In summary, nitrogen is converted into nitric acid in high yield and good Faraday efficiency







Abstract
The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5&#8201;%) were achieved at low potentials.

         <title>Deep Characterisation of the sn&#8208;Isomer Lipidome Using High&#8208;Throughput Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition and Ozone&#8208;Induced Dissociation

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shotgun lipidomics workflow incorporating data&#8208;independent acquisition and gas&#8208;phase ozonolysis enables characterisation of almost 1000 sn&#8208;resolved PC and PE lipids across four cell lines using an automated analysis pipeline. It reveals that isomer populations are tightly controlled in a cell&#8208;specific manner and enables identification of lipids containing ultralong&#8208;chain monounsaturated fatty acyls predominately at the sn&#8208;1 position.







Abstract
In recent years there has been a significant interest in the development of innovative lipidomics techniques capable of resolving lipid isomers. To date, methods applied to resolving sn&#8208;isomers have resolved only a limited number of species. We report a workflow based on ozone&#8208;induced dissociation for untargeted characterisation of hundreds of sn&#8208;resolved glycerophospholipid isomers from biological extracts in under 20&#8197;min, coupled with an automated data analysis pipeline. It provides an order of magnitude increase in the number of sn&#8208;isomer pairs identified as compared to previous reports and reveals that sn&#8208;isomer populations are tightly regulated and significantly different between cell lines. The sensitivity of this method and potential for de novo molecular discovery is further demonstrated by the identification of unexpected lipids containing ultra&#8208;long monounsaturated acyl chains at the sn&#8208;1 position.

         <title>Iminothioindoxyl Donors with Exceptionally High Cross Section for Protein Vibrational Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To observe site selective vibrational energy transfer (VET) in proteins in ultrafast pump probe experiments, an energy donor is required to inject vibrational energy. The only known donor amino acid azulenylalanine (AzAla) suffers from a low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, two novel iminothioindoxyl (ITI) based donor amino acids were introduced with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient to reach superior VET signal intensities.







Abstract
Various protein functions are related to vibrational energy transfer (VET) as an important mechanism. The underlying transfer pathways can be experimentally followed by ultrafast Vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy with a donor&#8208;sensor pair of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated in a protein. However, so far only one donor ncAA, azulenylalanine (AzAla), exists, which suffers from a comparably low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, we introduce two novel donor ncAAs based on an iminothioindoxyl (ITI) chromophore. The dimethylamino&#8208;ITI (DMA&#8208;ITI) and julolidine&#8208;ITI (J&#8208;ITI) moieties overcome the limitation of AzAla with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient. While ITI moieties are known for ultrafast photoswitching, DMA&#8208;ITI and J&#8208;ITI exclusively form a hot ground state on the sub&#8208;ps timescale instead, which is essential for their usage as vibrational energy donor. In VET measurements of donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides we investigate the performance of the new donors. We observe 20 times larger signals compared to the established AzAla donor, which opens unprecedented possibilities for the study of VET in proteins.

     alt="Iminothioindoxyl Donors with Exceptionally High Cross Section for Protein Vibrational Energy Transfer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observe site selective vibrational energy transfer (VET) in proteins in ultrafast pump probe experiments, an energy donor is required to inject vibrational energy. The only known donor amino acid azulenylalanine (AzAla) suffers from a low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, two novel iminothioindoxyl (ITI) based donor amino acids were introduced with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient to reach superior VET signal intensities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various protein functions are related to vibrational energy transfer (VET) as an important mechanism. The underlying transfer pathways can be experimentally followed by ultrafast Vis-pump/IR-probe spectroscopy with a donor-sensor pair of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated in a protein. However, so far only one donor ncAA, azulenylalanine (AzAla), exists, which suffers from a comparably low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, we introduce two novel donor ncAAs based on an iminothioindoxyl (ITI) chromophore. The dimethylamino-ITI (DMA-ITI) and julolidine-ITI (J-ITI) moieties overcome the limitation of AzAla with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient. While ITI moieties are known for ultrafast photoswitching, DMA-ITI and J-ITI exclusively form a hot ground state on the sub-ps timescale instead, which is essential for their usage as vibrational energy donor. In VET measurements of donor-sensor dipeptides we investigate the performance of the new donors. We observe 20 times larger signals compared to the established AzAla donor, which opens unprecedented possibilities for the study of VET in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Postsynthetic Modification in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, reversible covalent postsynthetic modification (PSM) is demonstrated in a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MTV&#8208;MOF) using thermoreversible furan&#8208;maleimide Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. The MOF was modified with a pendant furan functional group that was then capable of undergoing repeated cycles of PSM and de&#8208;modification with different functionalized maleimides. Reversible PSM was achieved with complete retention of structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of the MOF.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provides access to functional materials and advanced porous solid engineering. Herein, we report the reversible PSM of a multivariate isoreticular MOF by applying dynamic furan&#8208;maleimide Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) chemistry. The key step involves incorporating a furan group into the MOF via &#8220;click&#8221; PSM, which can then undergo repeated cycles of modification and de&#8208;modification with maleimides. The structural integrity, crystallinity, and porosity of the furan&#8208;appended MOF remained intact even after three consecutive PSM/de&#8208;modification cycles using three different functionalized maleimides.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Incarnatapeptins A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and the unusual use of silver carbonate to promote N&#8208;acylation, the first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B has been achieved, which unambiguously confirmed the structure of these natural products.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B, two novel marine natural products, was accomplished from readily available (S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyloxycarbonylhexahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid. This route, whose longest linear sequence was 12 steps, provided the incarnatapeptins A and B in yields of 26.5&#8201;% and 19.7&#8201;%, respectively, and enabled the structure and stereochemistry of both natural products to be unambiguously confirmed. Highlights of our synthesis include the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and a novel and practical N&#8208;acylation paradigm promoted by silver carbonate. The unusual facile atropisomerism of some linear peptidic intermediates was also observed by TLC analysis in the course of this work.

         <title>Towards a Light&#8208;mediated Gene Therapy for the Eye using Caged Ethinylestradiol and the Inducible Cre/lox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light sensitive caged ethinylestradiol (EE2) was used in combination with the inducible Cre/lox system for photoactivated transgene expression in the living eye. Following intravitreal injection of caged EE2 and irradiation with light at 450&#8197;nm, tdTomato reporter gene expression was robustly induced in retinal tissue.







Abstract
Increasingly, retinal pathologies are being treated with virus&#8208;mediated gene therapies. To be able to target viral transgene expression specifically to the pathological regions of the retina with light, we established an in vivo photoactivated gene expression paradigm for retinal tissue. Based on the inducible Cre/lox system, we discovered that ethinylestradiol is a suitable alternative to Tamoxifen as ethinylestradiol is more amenable to modification with photosensitive protecting compounds, i.e., &#8220;caging.&#8221; Identification of ethinylestradiol as a ligand for the mutated human estradiol receptor was supported by in silico binding studies showing the reduced binding of caged ethinylestradiol. Caged ethinylestradiol was injected into the eyes of double transgenic GFAP&#8208;CreERT2 mice with a Cre&#8208;dependent tdTomato reporter transgene followed by irradiation with light of 450&#8197;nm. Photoactivation significantly increased retinal tdTomato expression compared to controls. We thus demonstrated a first step towards the development of a targeted, light&#8208;mediated gene therapy for the eyes.

         <title>Immobilized Tetraalkylammonium Cations Enable Metal&#8208;free CO2 Electroreduction in Acid and Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively charged polyelectrolyte formed by the electrostatic interaction between poly(diallydimethylammonium)and graphene oxide is devised on the surface of Ag catalysts. This porous medium with immobilized cations augments CO2 electroreduction to CO in acid&#8208; and pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte&#8212;poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of 85&#8201;%, a carbon efficiency of 93&#8201;%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of 35&#8201;% for CO at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78&#8201;% CO FE with a 30&#8201;% EE at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.

The tandem synergistic effect of charge&#8208;enriched Cu&#8722;In dual sites confined on the edge of CuInP2S6 ML triggers C&#8722;C coupling, facilitating the dominant generation of C2H4. The marginal In site of ML preeminently targets CO2 conversion to *CO under light illumination, and the *CO then migrate to the neighbor Cu sites for the subsequent C&#8722;C coupling reaction into C2H4 with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility.







Abstract
One&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, single&#8208;crystal, hexagonal CuInP2S6 atomically thin sheets of&#8776;0.81&#8197;nm in thickness was successfully synthesized for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Exciting ethene (C2H4) as the main product was dominantly generated with the yield&#8208;based selectivity reaching &#8776;56.4&#8201;%, and the electron&#8208;based selectivity as high as &#8776;74.6&#8201;%. The tandem synergistic effect of charge&#8208;enriched Cu&#8722;In dual sites confined on the lateral edge of the CuInP2S6 monolayer (ML) is mainly responsible for efficient conversion and high selectivity of the C2H4 product as the basal surface site of the ML, exposing S atoms, can not derive the CO2 photoreduction due to the high energy barrier for the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of CO2 into *COOH. The marginal In site of the ML preeminently targets CO2 conversion to *CO under light illumination, and the *CO then migrates to the neighbor Cu sites for the subsequent C&#8722;C coupling reaction into C2H4 with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Moreover, ultrathin structure of the ML also allows to shorten the transfer distance of charge carriers from the interior onto the surface, thus inhibiting electron&#8208;hole recombination and enabling more electrons to survive and accumulate on the exposed active sites for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Iodinated Electron Acceptor with Significantly Extended Exciton Diffusion Length for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination in organic solar cell molecule yields a breakthrough with the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor BO&#8208;4I, delivering expanded exciton diffusion, improved intra&#8208;moiety excitation, and unprecedentedly low non&#8208;radiative losses, propelling photovoltaic efficiency forward.







Abstract
Iodination has unlocked new potentials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A newly designed and synthesized iodinated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, showcases exceptional excitation delocalization property with the exciton diffusion length increased to 80&#8197;nm. The enhanced electron delocalization property is attributed to the larger atomic radius and electron orbit of the iodine atom, which facilitates the formation of intra&#8208;moiety excitations in the acceptor phase. This effectively circumvents the charge transfer state&#8208;related recombination mechanisms, leading to a substantial reduction in non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). As a result, OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BO&#8208;4I achieves an impressive efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% with a notable &#916;Enr of 0.189&#8197;eV, markedly surpassing their fluorinated counterparts. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of iodination in reducing energy loss, thereby affirming its potential as a key strategy in the development of advanced next&#8208;generation OPV cells.

         <title>Helicoselective Synthesis of Indolohelicenoids through Organocatalytic Central&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Chirality Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition&#8208;elimination cascade reaction was developed to access chiral azahelicenoid skeletons. This convergent approach offers an organocatalytic helicoselective route to obtain indolohelicenoids with high enantioselectivity. The prepared indolohelicenoids display positive photophysical and chiroptical properties, showcasing their potential utility in organic photoelectric materials.







Abstract
We report the helicoselective and convergent construction of indolohelicenoids with excellent efficiency and stereocontrol. This reaction proceeds through a chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling one&#8208;pot central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.

         <title>Lateral Heterometal Junction Rectifier Fabricated by Sequential Transmetallation of Coordination Nanosheet
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lateral heterojunction, fabricated by spatially confined transmetallation of a precursor zinc(II) benzenehexathiolato coordination nanosheet with Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions is reported. Structural differences between the transmetallated and the as&#8208;prepared nanosheets lead to physical and chemical differences. Band structure bending across the interface of the transmetallated nanosheets results in the observed rectifying behavior.







Abstract
Heterostructures of two&#8208;dimensional materials realise novel and enhanced physical phenomena, making them attractive research targets. Compared to inorganic materials, coordination nanosheets have virtually infinite combinations, leading to tunability of physical properties and are promising candidates for heterostructure fabrication. Although stacking of coordination materials into vertical heterostructures is widely reported, reports of lateral coordination material heterostructures are few. Here we show the successful fabrication of a seamless lateral heterojunction showing diode behaviour, by sequential and spatially limited immersion of a new metalladithiolene coordination nanosheet, Zn3BHT, into aqueous Cu(II) and Fe(II) solutions. Upon immersion, the Zn centres in insulating Zn3BHT are replaced by Cu or Fe ions, resulting in conductivity. The transmetallation is spatially confined, occurring only within the immersed area. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point towards exploring transmetallation of various two&#8208;dimensional materials to produce lateral heterojunctions, by providing a new and facile synthetic route.

         <title>Vinylogous Urea&#8212;Urethane Vitrimers: Accelerating and Inhibiting Network Dynamics through Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 9, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, vinylogous urea (VUN) groups undergo much faster bond exchange than vinylogous urethanes (VUO), but this is not observed in their respective polymer networks. Surprisingly, blends of the two monomer types show increased network dynamics. The effects are correlated to hydrogen bonding, which catalyses covalent exchange and also reinforces networks by non&#8208;covalent interactions.







Abstract
Vinylogous urethane (VUO) based polymer networks are widely used as catalyst&#8208;free vitrimers that show rapid covalent bond exchange at elevated temperatures. In solution, vinylogous ureas (VUN) undergo much faster bond exchange than VUO and are highly dynamic at room temperature. However, this difference in reactivity is not observed in their respective dynamic polymer networks, as VUO and VUN vitrimers prepared herein with very similar macromolecular architectures show comparable stress relaxation and creep behavior. However, by using mixtures of VUO and VUN linkages within the same network, the dynamic reactions can be accelerated by an order of magnitude. The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VUO vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VUN, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea &#8208; urethane (VU) network of strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.

The results can be rationalized by the effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which is absent in VU&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; vitrimers, but is very pronounced for vinylogous urea moieties. At low concentrations of VU&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, these hydrogen bonds act as catalysts for covalent bond exchange, while at high concentration, they provide a pervasive vinylogous urea - urethane (VU) network of strong non-covalent interactions, giving rise to phase separation and inhibiting polymer chain dynamics. This offers a straightforward design principle for dynamic polymer materials, showing at the same time the possible additive and synergistic effects of supramolecular and dynamic covalent polymer networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Trace Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Rate and Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>

Trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives are inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, which implements a dual remodeling effect on Zn2+ solvation shell and Zn surface molecules, facilitating long&#8208;term stable and high&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion batteries at ultra&#8208;low temperatures.







Abstract
High&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries working at low temperatures are highly desirable for practical applications, but are challenged by sluggish kinetics and severe corrosion. Herein, inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, we report trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives that implement a dual remodeling effect for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The additive with high Zn absorbability not only remodels Zn2+ primary solvent shell by alternating H2O molecules, but also forms a shielding layer thus remodeling the Zn surface, which effectively enhances fast Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation reaction kinetics and prohibits Zn anode corrosion. Taking trace &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (&#945;DG) as a demonstration, the electrolyte obtains a low freezing point of &#8722;55.3&#8201;&#176;C, and the Zn//Zn cell can stably cycle for 2000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, with a high cumulative capacity of 5000&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A full battery that stably operates for 10000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is also demonstrated.

         <title>Enhancing Chiroptical Responses in Helical Nanographenes via Geometric&#160;Engineering of Double [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical nanographenes with high quantum yields and strong chiroptical responses are pivotal for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Here, we present the successful synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;extended double [7]helicenes (ED7Hs) where two helicene units are fused at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively, as the structural isomers of the reported ortho&#8208;fused ED7H. The structural geometry&#160;of these ED7Hs is clearly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Notably, this class of ED7Hs exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yields exceeding 40%. Through geometric&#160;regulation of two embedded [7]helicene units from ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; to para&#8208;position, these ED7Hs display exceptional amplification in chiroptical responses. This enhancement is evident in a remarkable approximate fivefold increase in the absorbance and luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs and glum), respectively, along with a boosted CPL brightness up to 176 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1, surpassing the performance of most helicene&#8208;based chiral NGs. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate that the geometric&#160;adjustment of two [7]helicene units allows the precise alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, leading to the observed enhancement of their chiroptical responses. This study offers an effective strategy for magnifying the CPL performance in chiral NGs, promoting their expanded application as CPL emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Phase Mixing Degree in Promoting C&#8208;C Coupling in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction on Cu&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been identified as the most promising candidates for generation of C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. Defect engineering in catalysts is a widely employed strategy for promoting C&#8208;C coupling on Cu. However, comprehensive understanding of defect structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationship has not been obtained. In this study, controllable defects generation is achieved, which leads to a series of Cu&#8208;based catalysts with various phase mixing degrees. It is observed that the Faradaic efficiency toward C2+ products increases with the phase mixing degree, reaching 81% at maximum. In&#8208;situ infrared absorption spectroscopy reveals that the catalysts with higher phase mixing degree tend to form *CO more easily and possess higher retention of *CO under high overpotential window, thereby promoting C&#8208;C coupling. This work sheds new light on the relationship between defects and C&#8208;C coupling, and the rational developed of more advanced Cu&#8208;base catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Polymer Electrolyte in MOF for Safe and High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoconfined polymer molecules exhibit profound transformations in their properties and behaviors. Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer&#8208;in&#8208;MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF&#8208;8 particles through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the polymer matrix, enhancing the Na ion dissociation&#160;kinetics. Simultaneously, the well&#8208;defined nanopores within ZIF&#8208;8 particles serve as nanoconfined ion migration channels, enabling rapid Na ion transport. As a result, this pioneering design enables the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve remarkable metrics, including a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.8 V vs. Na/Na+ at 80 &#176;C. The assembled SSMBs (with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode) exhibit dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 80 &#176;C.

Here, we present the synthesis of a polymer-in-MOF single ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte, where polymer segments are partially confined within nanopores ZIF-8 particles through Lewis acid-base interactions for solid-state sodium-metal batteries (SSMBs). The unique nanoconfinement effectively weakens Na ion coordination with the polymer matrix, enhancing the Na ion dissociation&#160;kinetics. Simultaneously, the well-defined nanopores within ZIF-8 particles serve as nanoconfined ion migration channels, enabling rapid Na ion transport. As a result, this pioneering design enables the solid polymer electrolyte to achieve remarkable metrics, including a Na ion transference number of 0.87, Na ion conductivity of 4.01&#215;10-4 S cm-1, and an extended electrochemical voltage window up to 4.8 V vs. Na/Na+ at 80 &#176;C. The assembled SSMBs (with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode) exhibit dendrite-free Na-metal deposition, promising rate capability, and stable cycling performance with 96% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 80 &#176;C. This innovative polymer-in-MOF design offers a compelling strategy for advancing high-performance and safe solid-state metal battery technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Molecular Motor&#8208;based Supramolecular Polymers Revealed by High Speed&#8208;AFM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers have a major potential for applications in responsive materials that are externally triggered by light with spatio&#8208;temporal control of their polymerisation state. While changes in macroscopic properties revealed the adaptive nature of these materials, it remains challenging to capture the dynamic depolymerisation process at the molecular level, which requires fast observation techniques combined with in situ irradiation. By implementing in situ UV illumination into a High&#8208;Speed Atomic Force Microscope (HS&#8208;AFM) setup, we have been able to capture the disassembly of a light&#8208;driven molecular motor&#8208;based supramolecular polymer. The real&#8208;time visualisation of the light&#8208;triggered disassembly process not only reveals cooperative depolymerisation, it also shows that this process continues after illumination is halted. Combining the data with cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and spectroscopy approaches, we obtain a molecular&#8208;level description of the motor&#8208;based polymer dynamics reminiscent of actin chain&#8208;end depolymerisation. Our detailed understanding of supramolecular depolymerisation will drive the development of future responsive polymer systems.</dc:description>
