         <title>MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Efficient Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8211;RR) is an important route for sustainable NH3 synthesis and environmental remediation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are one family of promising NO3&#8211;RR electrocatalysts, however,&#160;there is plenty of room to improve in their performance, calling for new design principles. Herein, a MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructured electrocatalyst with interfacial dual active sites and build&#8208;in electric field is fabricated for efficient NO3&#8211;RR to NH3 production. By growing Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanorods on Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) nanosheets, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the formation of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Co bonds at the interface of MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF heterostructure, leading to dual active sites tailed for NO3&#8211;RR. The Ni sites facilitate the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8211;, while the Co sites boost the H2O decomposition to supply active hydrogen (Hads) for N&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation on adjacent Ni sites, cooperatively reducing the energy barriers of NO3&#8211;RR process. Together with the accelerated electron transfer enabled by built&#8208;in electric field, remarkable NO3&#8211;RR performance is achieved with an NH3 yield rate of 11.46&#160;mg h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 98.4%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance NO3&#8211;RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulating Self&#8208;repairing Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dynamic Electric Double Layer for Practical Zinc ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) encounter interface issues stemming from the water&#8208;rich electrical double layer (EDL) and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose the dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing hybrid SEI for practical ZIBs via incorporating the horizontally&#8208;oriented dual&#8208;site additive. The rearrangement of distribution and molecular configuration of additive constructs the robust dynamic EDL under different interface charges. And, a self&#8208;repairing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI is constructed via the electrochemical decomposition of additive. The dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing SEI accelerate interfacial kinetics, regulate deposition and suppress side reactions in the both stripping and plating during long&#8208;term cycles, which affords high reversibility for 500 h at 42.7% depth of discharge or 50 mA&#183;cm&#8208;1. Remarkably, Zn//NVO full cells deliver the impressive cycling stability for 10000 cycles with 100% capacity retention at 3 A&#183;g&#8208;1 and for over 3000 cycles even at lean electrolyte (7.5 &#956;L&#183;mAh&#8208;1) and high loading (15.26 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2). Moreover, effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated in the low&#8208;temperature full cell (&#8208;30 oC).</dc:description>

         <title>Facilitating Formate Selectivity via Optimizing eg* Band Broadening in NiMn Hydroxides for Ethylene Glycol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene glycol electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (EGOR) on nickel&#8208;based hydroxides (Ni(OH)2) represents a promising strategy for generating value&#8208;added chemicals, i.e. formate and glycolate, and coupling water&#8208;electrolytic hydrogen production. The high product selectivity was one of the most significant area of polyols electro&#8208;oxidation process. Yet, developing Ni(OH)2&#8208;based EGOR electrocatalyst with highly selective product remains a challenge due to the unclear cognition about the EGOR mechanism. Herein, Mn&#8208;doped Ni(OH)2 catalysts were utilized to investigate the EGOR mechanism. Experimental and calculation results reveal that the electronic states of eg* band play an important role in the catalytic performance and the product selectivity for EGOR. Broadening the eg* band could effectively enhance the adsorption capacity of glyoxal intermediates. On the other hand, this enhanced adsorption could lead to reduced side reactions associated with glycolate formation, simultaneously promoting the cleavage of C&#8208;C bonds. Consequently, the selectivity for formate was notably augmented by these enhancements. This work offers new insights into the regulation of catalyst electronic states for improving polyol electrocatalytic activity and product selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Insulator&#8208;transition&#8208;induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d due to its inner &#178;perfecting&#178; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg'2&#173;&#173;a1g&#173;1&#160;eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg'4a1g&#173;2 eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8208;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8211;d presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Complex Chemistry and Degradation of Ascorbic Acid in Aqueous Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post&#8208;synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully&#8208;aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post-synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully-aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed-mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Alkene Atropisomers with Multiple Stereogenic Elements via Catalytic Asymmetric Rearrangement of 3&#8208;Indolylmethanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic enantioselective preparation of alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements and discovery of their applications have become significant but challenging issues in the scientific community due to the unique structures of this class of atropisomers. We herein report the first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles, a new kind of alkene atropisomers, with stereogenic point and axial chirality via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols under asymmetric organocatalysis. Notably, this novel type of alkene atropisomers have promising applications in developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts, discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Moreover, the theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction mechanism and the non&#8208;covalent interactions to control the enantioselectivity. This approach offers a new synthetic strategy for alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements, and represents the first catalytic enantioselective rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols, which will advance the chemistry of atropisomers and chiral indole chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Multipolar Structures and Carboxyl Groups in&#160; sp2&#8208;Carbon Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall&#160;Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through photocatalytic reaction via H2O and O2 is considered as an ideal approach. However, the efficiency of H2O2 generation is generally limited by insufficient charge and mass transfer. Covalent organic framework (COFs) offer a promising platform as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for H2O2&#160;production due to their potential for rational design at the molecular level. Herein, we integrated the multipolar structures and carboxyl groups into COFs to enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production in pure water without any sacrificial agents. The introduction of octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with an increase of molecular planarity, created efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Meanwhile, carboxyl groups could not only boost O2 and H2O2 movement via enhancement of pore hydrophilicity, but also promote proton conduction, enabling the conversion to H2O2 from &#183;O2&#8208;, which is the crucial intermediate product in H2O2 photocatalysis. Overall, we demonstrate that TACOF&#8208;1&#8208;COOH, consisting of optimal octupolar and quadrupolar structures, along with enrichment sites (carboxyl groups), exhibited a H2O2 yield rate of 3542 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (SCC) efficiency of 0.55%. This work provides valuable insights for designing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for efficient H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Gradient Desodiation Chemistry in Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra&#8208;stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg) cathode material in which a Mg&#8208;free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg&#8208;hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered&#8208;to&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high&#8208;valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The as&#8208;prepared NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000 cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127 mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Assembly of Acridines by Integrating Photo&#8208;Excitation of o&#8208;Alkyl&#160;Nitroarenes&#160;with Copper&#8208;Promoted Cascade Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acridine frameworks stand as pivotal architectural elements in pharmaceuticals and photocatalytic applications, owing to their chemical adaptability, biological activity, and unique excited&#8208;state dynamics. Conventional synthetic routes often entail specialized starting materials, anaerobic or moisture&#8208;free conditions, and elaborate multi&#8208;stage manipulations for incorporating diverse functionalities. Herein, we present a convergent approach integrating photo&#8208;excitation of readily available ortho&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with copper&#8208;promoted cascade annulation. This innovative system enables an aerobic, one&#8208;pot reaction of o&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with arylboronic acids, thereby streamlining the modular construction of a wide array of acridine dervatives with various functional groups. This encompasses symmetrical, unsymmetrical and polysubstituted varieties, some of which are otherwise exceptionally difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, it significantly improves the production of structurally varied acridinium salts, featuring enhanced photophysical properties, high excited state potentials (E*red = 2.08&#8722;3.15 V), and exhibiting superior performance in intricate photoredox transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via formal single electron reduction of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes under photochemical conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(sp3)&#8208;rich heterocycles are privileged building blocks for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Therefore, synthetic methods that provide access to novel saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles are in high demand. Herein, we report a general synthesis of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH) via a formal cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABB) with styrenes under photochemical conditions. To overcome the challenging direct single electron reduction of ABBs, we designed a polar&#8208;radical&#8208;polar relay strategy that leverages a fast acid&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening of ABBs to form bromoazetidines, which undergo efficient debrominative radical formation to initiate the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction is applicable to a broad range of ABB&#8208;ketones and we demonstrate the 1&#8208;aza&#8208;BCH products can be further functionalised to access larger saturated, conformationally rigid heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unlikely Occurring Quadrangular Tube by Modulating Intramolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the central focuses in self&#8208;assembly is precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. Trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7&#8208;positions are functionalized with two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical application is hindered by zinc anode limitations. We introduce diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive to address these challenges. DTPA&#8208;Na's unique dual functionality enables the formation of robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the zinc anode and stable cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits dendrite growth, leading to exceptional cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition. Asymmetrical cells employing DTPA&#8208;Na achieve an unprecedented 32,000 cycles at a high charging rate of 50 mA/cm2, while symmetric cells demonstrate a lifespan of 160 hours with 95% zinc utilization. Full Zn||MnOOH cells exhibit remarkable stability, maintaining 98.61% capacity retention after 720 hours of self&#8208;discharge and negligible capacity decay over 5000 cycles. Our work highlights the transformative potential of DTPA&#8208;Na as a dual&#8208;functional electrolyte additive, paving the way for high&#8208;performance ZIBs for practical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of 1&#8208;Octene with [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the quantitative electro&#8208;hydrogenation of unactivated alkenes with H2O in neutral or even alkaline conditions. Electro&#8208;hydrogenation is typically driven by H+ reduction in acidic media to generate reactive metal&#8208;hydrides, which then either hydrogenate or react with H+ to liberate H2 in a parasitic process. Our work shows that H2 evolution can be suppressed by forming metal&#8208;hydrides via oxidative addition of H2O instead of H+ reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene as non&#8208;activated model substrate with neutral water as H&#8208;donor is reported, using [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] (1) as the catalyst, to form octane with high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96&#8201;% and a kobs of 87&#8197;s&#8722;1. Cyclic voltammetry with 1 revealed that two subsequent reductions trigger the elimination of Cl&#8722; and afford the highly reactive anionic Ir(I) hydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)]&#8722; (2), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of 1 in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)2] (3) in 88&#8201;% FE from the reaction of 2 with H2O. Complex 3 then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro&#8208;hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H2 formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu4NOH added), the electro&#8208;hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene with 1 also proceeds cleanly (89&#8201;% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H2O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H+ reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H2O as a key step in this context.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Delivery of Carbon Disulfide in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system has been developed for cell platform applications, and it is found that the hepatoxicity caused by CS2 is related to oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death.







Abstract
Carbon disulfide (CS2) is an environmental contaminant, which is deadly hazardous to the workers under chronic or acute exposure. However, the toxicity mechanisms of CS2 are still unclear due to the scarcity of biocompatible donors, which can release CS2 in cells. Here we developed the first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system based on the &#8220;click&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; reactions between mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;5&#8208;thiolates (TATs) and strained cyclooctyne exo&#8208;BCN&#8208;OH. We successfully realized intracellular CS2 release and investigated the causes of CS2&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death. It is found that CS2 can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death. These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS2 in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS2 delivery system.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Supported 2&#8208;Sila and 2&#8208;Germavinylidenes: Synthesis, Dynamics, First Reactivity and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;supported 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes 1&#8208;E were prepared by a C(NHC) transfer reaction of the diazoolefin (NHC)CN2 with (E)&#8208;(Tbb)BrE=EBr(Tbb). Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal an interesting electronic structure of the 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes 1&#8208;E, which display stereodynamics in solution and undergo an 1,2&#8208;addition reaction with GeBr2(1,4&#8208;dioxane) across the E=C multiple bonds forming NHC&#8208;supported bromogermynes 2&#8208;EGe.







Abstract
2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (C=EH2; E=Si, Ge) are according to quantum chemical studies the least stable isomers on the [E,C,2H] potential energy hypersurface isomerizing easily via the trans&#8208;bent tetrelaacetylenes HE&#8801;CH to the thermodynamically most stable 1&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (E=CH2). Consequently, experimental studies on 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes (C=ER2) and their derivatives are lacking. Herein we report experimental and theoretical studies of the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) supported 2&#8208;silavinylidene (NHC)C=SiBr(Tbb) (1&#8208;Si: NHC=C[N(Dipp)CH]2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Tbb=2,6&#8208;bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) and the isovalent 2&#8208;germavinylidenes (NHC)C=GeBr(R) (1&#8208;Ge, 1&#8208;GeMind: R=Tbb, Mind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7&#8208;octamethyl&#8208;s&#8208;hydrindacene&#8208;4&#8208;yl)). The NHC&#8208;supported 2&#8208;tetrelavinylidenes were obtained selectively from the 1,2&#8208;dibromoditetrelenes (E)&#8208;(R)BrE=EBr(R) using the diazoolefin (NHC)CN2 as vinylidene transfer reagent. 1&#8208;E (E=Si, Ge) have a planar vinylidene core, a bent&#8208;dicoordinated vinylidene carbon atom (CVNL), a very short E=CVNL bond and an almost orthogonal orientation of the NHC five&#8208;membered ring to the vinylidene core.

&lt;p&gt;NHC-supported 2-tetrelavinylidenes &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; were prepared by a C(NHC) transfer reaction of the diazoolefin (NHC)CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-(Tbb)BrE=EBr(Tbb). Structural, spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal an interesting electronic structure of the 2-tetrelavinylidenes &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt;, which display stereodynamics in solution and undergo an 1,2-addition reaction with GeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1,4-dioxane) across the E=C multiple bonds forming NHC-supported bromogermynes &lt;b&gt;2-EGe&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-tetrelavinylidenes (C=EH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; E=Si, Ge) are according to quantum chemical studies the least stable isomers on the [E,C,2H] potential energy hypersurface isomerizing easily via the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-bent tetrelaacetylenes HE&#8801;CH to the thermodynamically most stable 1-tetrelavinylidenes (E=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, experimental studies on 2-tetrelavinylidenes (C=ER&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and their derivatives are lacking. Herein we report experimental and theoretical studies of the first N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) supported 2-silavinylidene (NHC)C=SiBr(Tbb) (&lt;b&gt;1-Si&lt;/b&gt;: NHC=C[N(Dipp)CH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dipp=2,6-diisopropylphenyl, Tbb=2,6-bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-4-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylphenyl) and the isovalent 2-germavinylidenes (NHC)C=GeBr(R) (&lt;b&gt;1-Ge, 1-GeMind&lt;/b&gt;: R=Tbb, Mind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octamethyl-&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-hydrindacene-4-yl)). The NHC-supported 2-tetrelavinylidenes were obtained selectively from the 1,2-dibromoditetrelenes (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-(R)BrE=EBr(R) using the diazoolefin (NHC)CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as vinylidene transfer reagent. &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; (E=Si, Ge) have a planar vinylidene core, a bent-dicoordinated vinylidene carbon atom (C&lt;sup&gt;VNL&lt;/sup&gt;), a very short E=C&lt;sup&gt;VNL&lt;/sup&gt; bond and an almost orthogonal orientation of the NHC five-membered ring to the vinylidene core. Quantum chemical analysis of the electronic structures of &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; suggest a significantly bent 1-tetrelaallene and tetrelyne character. NMR studies shed light into the dynamics of &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; involving NHC-rotation around the C&lt;sup&gt;VNL&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;NHC&lt;/sup&gt; bond with a low activation barrier. Furthermore, the synthetic potential of &lt;b&gt;1-E&lt;/b&gt; is demonstrated by the synthesis and full characterization of the unprecedented NHC-supported bromogermynes BrGe=C(EBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Tbb)(NHC) (&lt;b&gt;2-SiGe&lt;/b&gt;: E=Si; &lt;b&gt;2-GeGe&lt;/b&gt;: E=Ge).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient bacterial metabolite that potently activates T lymphocytes called MAIT cells is too unstable in water to fully exploit in biology. Here, we describe highly stable and extremely potent new immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, and probes that shed new light on the mechanism of MAIT cell activation. These new chemical tools offer fresh insights for designing novel vaccines, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;infective drugs.







Abstract
Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by&#8208;product, 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;d&#8208;ribityl&#8208;aminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but it is rapidly degraded in water. This natural product covalently bonds to the key immunological protein MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 refolding and trafficking to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties. Here, we strategically modify this natural product to understand the molecular basis of its recognition by MR1. This culminated in the discovery of new water&#8208;stable compounds with extremely powerful and distinctive immunological functions. We report their capacity to bind MR1 inside APCs, triggering its expression on the cell surface (EC50 17&#8197;nM), and their potent activation (EC50 56&#8197;pM) or inhibition (IC50 80&#8197;nM) of interacting MAIT cells. We further derivatize compounds with diazirine&#8208;alkyne, biotin, or fluorophore (Cy5 or AF647) labels for detecting, monitoring, and studying cellular MR1. Computer modeling casts new light on the molecular mechanism of activation, revealing that potent activators are first captured in a tyrosine&#8208; and serine&#8208;lined cleft in MR1 via specific pi&#8208;interactions and H&#8208;bonds, before more tightly attaching via a covalent bond to Lys43 in MR1. This chemical study advances our molecular understanding of how bacterial metabolites are captured by MR1, influence cell surface expression of MR1, interact with T cells to induce immunity, and offers novel clues for developing new vaccine adjuvants, immunotherapeutics, and anticancer drugs.

         <title>Catalytic (4+2) Annulation via Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Interception of in&#8208;situ Generated Alkylgold Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished under gold&#8208;complex and chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide synergetic catalysis, providing chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans with high efficiency and selectivity. This method complements the (4+2) annulation of allene reagents via a formal cycloaddition on internal &#960;&#8208;bond, which is challenging and remains elusive.







Abstract
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective stepwise (4+2) annulation of N&#8208;propargylamides and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imines/ketones has been accomplished with synergetic catalysis by a combination of a gold&#8208;complex and a chiral quinine&#8208;derived squaramide (QN&#8208;SQA), leading to highly functionalized chiral tetrahydropyridines/dihydropyrans in good to high yields with generally excellent enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the in situ formed alkylgold species is the key intermediate in this transformation, and the amide group served as a traceless directing group in this highly selective transformation. This method complements the enantioselective (4+2) annulation of allene reagents, providing the formal internal C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bond cycloaddition products, which is challenging and remains elusive.

         <title>Engineering Low Volume Resuscitants for the Prehospital Care of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traumatic injury is a leading cause of global suffering and death. We rationally design polymeric, low volume resuscitants (LVRs) for the prehospital treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock. By varying polymer architecture, Rg, and composition to influence resuscitation, coagulation, and biodistribution, we developed a radiant star polymer that is non&#8208;coagulopathic and corrects 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable LVR has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.







Abstract
Globally, traumatic injury is a leading cause of suffering and death. The ability to curtail damage and ensure survival after major injury requires a time&#8208;sensitive response balancing organ perfusion, blood loss, and portability, underscoring the need for novel therapies for the prehospital environment. Currently, there are few options available for damage control resuscitation (DCR) of trauma victims. We hypothesize that synthetic polymers, which are tunable, portable, and stable under austere conditions, can be developed as effective injectable therapies for trauma medicine. In this work, we design injectable polymers for use as low volume resuscitants (LVRs). Using RAFT polymerization, we evaluate the effect of polymer size, architecture, and chemical composition upon both blood coagulation and resuscitation in a rat hemorrhagic shock model. Our therapy is evaluated against a clinically used colloid resuscitant, Hextend. We demonstrate that a radiant star poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) polymer did not interfere with coagulation while successfully correcting metabolic deficit and resuscitating animals from hemorrhagic shock to the desired mean arterial pressure range for DCR &#8211; correcting a 60&#8201;% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10&#8201;% TBV. This highly portable and non&#8208;coagulopathic resuscitant has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.

         <title>Alumina &#8211; Stabilized SEI and CEI in Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin film (10&#8197;&#956;m) of alumina (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated on both sides of commercial polypropene separators, then transferred onto both anode and cathode surfaces during cell assembly.

Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated onto both sides of commercial polypropene separator to create artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and artificial cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) in potassium metal batteries (KMBs). This significantly enhances the stability, including of KMBs with Prussian Blue (PB) cathodes. For example, symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2 and 3.0&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2. Alumina modified separators promote electrolyte wetting and increase ionic conductivity (0.59 vs. 0.2&#8197;mS/cm) and transference number (0.81 vs. 0.23). Cryo&#8208;stage focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis of cycled modified anode demonstrates dense and planar electrodeposits, versus unmodified baseline consisting of metal filaments (dendrites) interspersed with pores and SEI. Alumina&#8208;modified CEI also suppresses elemental Fe crossover and reduces cathode cracking. Mesoscale modeling of metal &#8211; SEI interactions captures crucial role of intrinsic heterogeneities, illustrating how artificial SEI affects reaction current distribution, conductivity and morphological stability.

         <title>Orthogonal Radical and Cationic Single&#8208;Unit Monomer Insertions for Engineering Polymer Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing the monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and making necessary adjustments to the reaction conditions, we have successfully developed the orthogonal single&#8208;unit monomer insertions (SUMIs) technique. This technique allows for the simultaneous implementation of radical and cationic SUMI reactions in a single reaction vessel without any mutual interference.







Abstract
The single&#8208;unit monomer insertion (SUMI), derived from living/controlled polymerization, can be directly functionalized at the end or within the chain of polymers prepared by living/controlled polymerization, offering potential applications in the preparation of polymers with complex architectures. Many scenarios demand the simultaneous incorporation of monomers suitable for different polymerization methods into complex polymers. Therefore, it becomes imperative to utilize SUMI technologies with diverse mechanisms, especially those that are compatible with each other. Here, we reported the orthogonal SUMI technique, seamlessly combining radical and cationic SUMI approaches. Through the careful optimization of monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and adjustments to reaction conditions, we can efficiently execute both radical and cationic SUMI processes in one pot without mutual interference. The utilization of orthogonal SUMI pairs facilitates the integration of radical and cationic reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various configurations. This flexibility enables the synthesis of diblock, triblock, and star polymers that incorporate both cationically and radically polymerizable monomers. Moreover, we have successfully implemented a mixing mechanism of free radicals and cations in RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization, resulting in the creation of a side&#8208;chain sequence&#8208;controlled polymer brushes.

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine and nitrile groups efficiently enable lysine&#8208;selective amidination of peptides and proteins. The amidine products retain a positive charge at the modified sites and allow the charge&#8208;related properties to be preserved, such as the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and the interaction with negatively charged DNA to form protein&#8208;DNA fibres. The amidine products can undergo multi&#8208;site secondary modifications.







Abstract
Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.

         <title>Spirobifluorene Trimers: High Triplet Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of extended pure hydrocarbon (PHC) materials with a high triplet energy, a wide HOMO/LUMO gap and improved thermal properties compared to reported PHCs have been constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. When used as the host in blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24&#8201;% with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off was reached.







Abstract
Pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHCs) represent a new generation of host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), free of heteroatoms. They reduce the molecular complexity, can be easily synthesized and are an important direction towards robust devices. As heteroatoms can be involved in bonds dissociations in operating OLEDs through exciton induced degradation processes, developing novel PHCs appear particularly relevant for the future of this technology. In the present work, we report a series of extended PHCs constructed by the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. The resulting positional isomers present a high triplet energy level, a wide HOMO/LUMO difference and improved thermal and morphological properties compared to previously reported PHCs. These characteristics are beneficial for the next generation of host materials for PhOLEDs and provide relevant design guidelines. When used as a host in blue&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs, which are still the weakest link of the field, a very high EQE of 24&#8201;% and low threshold voltage of 3.56&#8197;V were obtained with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. This high performance strengthens the position of PHC strategy as an efficient alternative for OLED technology and opens the way to a more simple electronic.

         <title>Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding Networks Stabilized Organic Supramolecular Cathode for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity and Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic cathode BQQPH with multiple active sites is developed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable Al batteries. The six C=O and six C=N groups in BQQPH enables a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions within BQQPH enable robust structural stability and minimal solubility, yielding an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage, attributing to the abundant reserves, low cost, intrinsic safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, the cathode materials reported thus far still face challenges such as limited capacity, sluggish kinetics, and undesirable cycle life. Herein, we propose an organic cathode benzo[i] benzo[6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a] benzo [6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;5,8,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaone (BQQPH) for RABs. The six C=O and six C=N redox active sites in each molecule enable BQQPH to deliver a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Encouragingly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions endow BQQPH with robust structural stability and minimal solubility, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group induces a reduction in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which considerably enhances both the discharge voltage and redox kinetics of BQQPH. In situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations unveil that the charge storage mechanism is reversible coordination/dissociation of AlCl2+ with the N and O sites in BQQPH accompanied by 12&#8208;electron transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials for RABs.

The six C=O and six C=N redox active sites in each molecule enable BQQPH to deliver a record ultra-high capacity of 413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Encouragingly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions endow BQQPH with robust structural stability and minimal solubility, enabling an ultra-long lifetime of 100,000&#8197;cycles. Moreover, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group induces a reduction in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and expands the &#960;-conjugated system, which considerably enhances both the discharge voltage and redox kinetics of BQQPH. In situ and ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations unveil that the charge storage mechanism is reversible coordination/dissociation of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with the N and O sites in BQQPH accompanied by 12-electron transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high-performance organic cathode materials for RABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Systematic Study of Methyl Carbodithioate Esters as Effective Gold Contact Groups for Single&#8208;Molecule Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Carbodithioate ester&#8208;containing molecular wires have been synthesized and characterized to demonstrate the functionality as a great contact group for molecular electronics with good all&#8208;around properties including strong surface binding and high conductance. Raman, XPS and theoretical calculations support the STM&#8208;BJ conductance data and rationalize the binding groups&#8217; performance through a strong C=S to Au interaction.







Abstract
There are several binding groups used within molecular electronics for anchoring molecules to metal electrodes (e.g., R&#8722;SMe, R&#8722;NH2, R&#8722;CS2&#8722;, R&#8722;S&#8722;). However, some anchoring groups that bind strongly to electrodes have poor/unknown stability, some have weak electrode coupling, while for some their binding motifs are not well defined. Further binding groups are required to aid molecular design and to achieve a suitable balance in performance across a range of properties. We present an in&#8208;depth investigation into the use of carbodithioate esters as contact groups for single&#8208;molecule conductance measurements, using scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction measurements (STM&#8208;BJ) and detailed surface spectroscopic analysis. We demonstrate that the methyl carbodithioate ester acts as an effective contact for gold electrodes in STM&#8208;BJ measurements. Surface enhanced Raman measurements demonstrate that the C=S functionality remains intact when adsorbed on to gold nanoparticles. A gold(I) complex was also synthesised showing a stable C=S&#8594;AuI interaction from the ester. Comparison with a benzyl thiomethyl ether demonstrates that the C=S moiety significantly contributes to charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions. The overall performance of the CS2Me group demonstrates it should be used more extensively and has strong potential for the fabrication of larger area devices with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Macrocycle for Efficient Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins, DNA, and CRISPR Cas9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell penetrating macrocycle (CPM) with flexible amine linkages and amphiphilic nature assembles into a micellar&#8208;like structure that can passively permeate through the cell membrane. CPM can efficiently transfer fully functioning proteins and genetic materials into the cytosol, independent of size, charge, or complexity.







Abstract
The discovery of safe platforms that can circumvent the endocytic pathway is of great significance for biological therapeutics that are usually degraded during endocytosis. Here we show that a self&#8208;assembled and dynamic macrocycle can passively diffuse through the cell membrane and deliver a broad range of biologics, including proteins, CRISPR Cas9, and ssDNA, directly to the cytosol while retaining their bioactivity. Cell&#8208;penetrating macrocycle CPM can be easily prepared from the room temperature condensation of diketopyrrolopyrrole lactams with diamines. We attribute the high cellular permeability of CPM to its amphiphilic nature and chameleonic properties. It adopts conformations that partially bury polar groups and expose hydrophobic side chains, thus self&#8208;assembling into micellar&#8208;like structures. Its superior fluorescence makes CPM trackable inside cells where it follows the endomembrane system. CPM outperformed commercial reagents for biologics delivery and showed high RNA knockdown efficiency of CRISPR Cas9. We envisage that this macrocycle will be an ideal starting point to design and synthesize biomimetic macrocyclic tags that can readily facilitate the interaction and uptake of biomolecules and overcome endosomal digestion.

         <title>An Alkyne&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Framework Featuring Interactive Pockets for Bromine Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine, a useful, although toxic halogen can coexist with I2 in an equilibrium product of IBr. Here, we propose a new Covalent Organic Framework (COF) featuring triple bonds, an electron&#8208;rich pyrene unit, and heteroatoms (N sites) to selectively capture Br2 over I2. The participation of the triple bond can be classified as a combined physisorption as well as chemisorption process, giving rise to a unique method for the capture of Br2.







Abstract
The high degree of corrosivity and reactivity of bromine, which is released from various sources, poses a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, its coexistence with iodine forming an equilibrium compound, iodine monobromide (IBr) necessitates the selective capture of bromine from halogen mixtures. The electrophilicity of halogens to &#960;&#8208;electron rich structures enabled us to strategically design a covalent organic framework for halogen capture, featuring a defined pore environment with localized sorption sites. The higher capture capacity of bromine (4.6&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1) over iodine by ~41&#8201;% shows its potential in selective capture. Spectroscopic results uncovering the preferential interaction sites are supported by theoretical investigations. The alkyne bridge is a core functionality promoting the selectivity in capture by synergistic physisorption, rationalized by the higher orbital overlap of bromine due to its smaller atomic size as well as reversible chemical interactions. The slip stacking in the structure has further promoted this phenomenon by creating clusters of molecular interaction sites with bromine intercalated between the layers. The inclusion of unsaturated moieties, i.e. triple bonds and the complementary pore geometry offer a promising design strategy for the construction of porous materials for halogen capture.

         <title>Carboxylesterase Activatable Molecular Probe for Personalized Treatment Guidance by Analyte&#8208;Induced Molecular Transformation</title>

A near&#8208;infrared fluorescence/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode molecular probe with high specificity and responsiveness of carboxylesterase was developed through the analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation strategy.







Abstract
Accurate visualization of tumor microenvironment is of great significance for personalized medicine. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual&#8208;mode molecular probe (denoted as NIR&#8722;CE) for distinguishing tumors based on carboxylesterase (CE) level by an analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation (AIMT) strategy. The recognition moiety for CE activity is the acetyl unit of NIR&#8722;CE, generating the pre&#8208;product, NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;OH, which undergoes spontaneous hydrogen atom exchange between the nitrogen atoms in the indole group and the phenol hydroxyl group, eventually transforming into NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;H. In cellular experiments and in vivo blind studies, the human hepatoma cells and tumors with high level of CE were successfully distinguished by both NIR FL and PA imaging. Our findings provide a new molecular imaging strategy for personalized treatment guidance.

         <title>An Enzymatic Prodrug&#8208;like Route to Thio and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic route to thioamides was elucidated as part of the biosynthesis of the antimetabolite 6&#8208;thioguanine in plant&#8208;pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, an adenylating enzyme forms an intermediate cysteine&#8208;S&#8208;conjugate that is cleaved by a designated C&#8722;S lyase, a process that mirrors a prodrug approach in cancer therapy.







Abstract
6&#8208;Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA&#8208;targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by Erwinia amylovorans, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur&#8208;mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug&#8208;like thio&#8208;conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of l&#8208;cysteine to the activated carbonyl. A designated C&#8722;S lyase (YcfC) then cleaves the resulting S&#8208;adduct to yield the thioamide. This pathway is distinct from canonical tRNA sulfur modifications and known enzymatic peptide thionations. By exploring a wide range of substrate surrogates, we exploited the tolerance of the enzyme pair to produce even a seleno analog. This study provides valuable insight into a previously unexplored area of bacterial thioamide formation and lays the groundwork for synthetic biology approaches to produce thioamide antimetabolites.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Control in Dysprosium(III) Metallacrown Magnets via Thioacetal Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thioacetal modification, a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown with a square planar NiII successfully realized chemical&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) and the spin state of NiII altering from low&#8208;spin S=0 to high&#8208;spin S=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics.







Abstract
Integrating controllable spin states into single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) enables precise manipulation of magnetic interactions at a molecular level, but remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we developed a 3d&#8211;4f metallacrown (MC) magnet [DyNi5(quinha)5(Clsal)2(py)8](ClO4)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (H2quinha=quinaldichydroxamic acid, HClsal=5&#8208;chlorosalicylaldehyde) wherein a square planar NiII is stabilized by chemical stacking. Thioacetal modification was employed via post&#8208;synthetic ligand substitutions and yielded [DyNi5(quinha)5(Clsaldt)2(py)8](ClO4)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (HClsaldt=4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol). Thanks to the additional ligations of thioacetal onto the NiII site, coordination&#8208;induced spin state switching (CISSS) took place with spin state altering from low&#8208;spin S=0 to high&#8208;spin S=1. The synergy of CISSS effect and magnetic interactions results in distinct energy splitting and magnetic dynamics. Magnetic studies indicate prominent enhancement of reversal barrier from 57&#8197;cm&#8722;1 to 423&#8197;cm&#8722;1, along with hysteresis opening and an over 200&#8208;fold increment in coercive field at 2&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations provide deeper insights into the exchange models and rationalize the relaxation/tunnelling pathways. These results demonstrate here provide a fire&#8208;new perspective in modulating the magnetization relaxation via the incorporation of controllable spin states and magnetic interactions facilitated by the CISSS approach.

         <title>Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO by Ligand Engineering of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active electrocatalyst for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion was successfully prepared by the ligand engineering of Au25 nanoclusters with a cation&#8208;relaying ligand. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized nanoclusters was significantly boosted when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of the ligand, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT=1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+&lt;Na+&lt;K+&lt;Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.

         <title>Quantification of Native Lignin Structural Features with Gel&#8208;Phase 2D&#8208;HSQC0 Reveals Lignin Structural Changes During Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a method featuring an extrapolated time&#8208;zero Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) sequence on whole cell walls samples, we can successfully quantify native lignin's structural features. Applying this tool to compare whole cell wall samples to extracted lignin reveals fundamental differences in the apparent linkage distribution within the polymer, which provides insight into lignin's fractionation mechanism.







Abstract
Our ability to study and valorize the lignin fraction of biomass is hampered by the fundamental and still unmet challenge of precisely quantifying native lignin's structural features. Here, we developed a rapid elevated&#8208;temperature 1H&#8722;13C Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) NMR method that enables this precise quantification of native lignin structural characteristics even with whole plant cell wall (WPCW) NMR spectroscopy, overcoming fast spin relaxation in the gel phase. We also formulated a Gaussian fitting algorithm to perform automatic and reliable spectral integration. By combining HSQC0 measurements with yield measurements following depolymerisation, we can confirm the combinatorial nature of radical coupling reactions during biosynthesis leading to a random sequential organization of linkages within a largely linear lignin chain. Such analyses illustrate how this analytical method can greatly facilitate the study of native lignin structure, which can then be used for fundamental studies or to understand lignin depolymerization methods like reductive catalytic fractionation or aldehyde&#8208;assisted fractionation.

         <title>Solar Azo&#8208;Switches for Effective E&#8594;Z Photoisomerization by Sunlight</title>

Sunlight&#8208;induced isomerization of azo&#8208;switches is realized through spectral reshaping. Our sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches absorb across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum and achieve 80&#8211;90&#8201;% E&#8594;Z isomerization yields under unfiltered sunlight. Solar switches hold great potential for sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy utilization for applications such as molecular machines, actuators, and molecular solar thermal storage.







Abstract
Natural photoactive systems have evolved to harness broad&#8208;spectrum light from solar radiation for critical functions such as light perception and photosynthetic energy conversion. Molecular photoswitches, which undergo structural changes upon light absorption, are artificial photoactive tools widely used for developing photoresponsive systems and converting light energy. However, photoswitches generally need to be activated by light of specific narrow wavelength ranges for effective photoconversion, which limits their ability to directly work under sunlight and to efficiently harvest solar energy. Here, focusing on azo&#8208;switches&#8212;the most extensively studied photoswitches, we demonstrate effective solar E&#8594;Z photoisomerization with photoconversions exceeding 80&#8201;% under unfiltered sunlight. These sunlight&#8208;driven azo&#8208;switches are developed by rendering the absorption of E isomers overwhelmingly stronger than that of Z isomers across a broad ultraviolet to visible spectrum. This unusual type of spectral profile is realized by a simple yet highly adjustable molecular design strategy, enabling the fine&#8208;tuning of spectral window that extends light absorption beyond 600&#8197;nm. Notably, back&#8208;photoconversion can be achieved without impairing the forward solar isomerization, resulting in unique light&#8208;reversible solar switches. Such exceptional solar chemistry of photoswitches provides unprecedented opportunities for developing sustainable light&#8208;driven systems and efficient solar energy technologies.

         <title>Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: An ab Initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>

We identify a symmetric dimension that is important for electron transfer or electronic localization from quantum chemical calculations and find that it naturally occurs in bridged mixed&#8208;valent systems as a consequence of the superexchange coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing question in electron transfer research concerns the number and identity of collective nuclear motions that drive electron transfer or localisation. It is well established that these nuclear motions are commonly gathered into a so&#8208;called electron transfer coordinate. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate that both anti&#8208;symmetric and symmetric vibrational motions are intrinsic to bridged systems, and that both are required to explain the characteristic shape of their intervalence charge transfer bands. Using the properties of a two&#8208;state Marcus&#8211;Hush model, we identify and quantify these two coordinates as linear combinations of normal modes from ab initio calculations. This quantification gives access to the potential coupling, reorganization energy and curvature of the potential energy surfaces involved in electron transfer, independent of any prior assumptions about the system of interest. We showcase these claims with the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion, a prototypical Class III mixed valence complex. We find that the symmetric dimension is responsible for the asymmetric band shape, and trace this back to the offset of the ground and excited state potentials in this dimension. The significance of the symmetric dimension originates from geometry dependent coupling, which in turn is a natural consequence of the well&#8208;established superexchange mechanism. The conceptual connection between the symmetric and anti&#8208;symmetric motions and the superexchange mechanism appears as a general result for bridged systems.

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non&#8208;renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness. However, the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact hinder SSLMBs&#8217; practical application. In this paper, the flexible SPE of in situ polymerized PAAA opens and stabilizes the Li+ &#8242;highway&#8242; inside the SPE, enhancing Li+ transport, and the oxygen vacancies of SiO2 synergize with the substrate to bind the TFSI&#8722;, forming and transporting freer Li+, thus achieving high performance of SSLMBs at room temperature. This study provides ideas for the practical application of SSLMBs.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8722; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Boosting Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to Ethanol via Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Defected Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8208;N2 Motif</title>

Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst with defected Cu&#8208;N2 motif was prepared by a CN intermediate&#8208;assisted impregnation strategy. Cu+/Cu2+ dual&#8208;valence state and electron enrichment of Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V favorable to *CO adsorption and then C&#8722;C coupling, enabling CO2 photoreduction to ethanol.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been shown to selectively catalyze CO2 photoreduction to C2+ solar fuels. However, they still suffer from poor activity and low selectivity. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol and delivers 69.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8&#8201;% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with DFT calculations, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration, in which the Cu sites are electron enriched and enhance electron delocalization. Importantly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in both Cu+ and Cu2+ valence states, although predominantly as Cu+. The Cu+ sites support the CO2 activation, while the co&#8208;existence of Cu+/Cu2+ sites are highly conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8722;C coupling. Furthermore, the hollow microstructure of the catalyst also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for the solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also elucidates the C&#8208;C coupling reaction path via *CO&#8208;*CO to *COCOH and rate&#8208;determining step, and reveals the valence state change of partial Cu species from Cu+ to Cu2+ in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during CO2 photoreduction reaction.

Collectively, these make Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-V an effective and high-performance catalyst for the solar-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to ethanol. This study also elucidates the C-C coupling reaction path via *CO-*CO to *COCOH and rate-determining step, and reveals the valence state change of partial Cu species from Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-V during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On Tautomerism and Amphoterism: An In&#8208;Depth Structural and Physicochemical Characterization of Ammeline and Some of Its Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammeline was solved for the first time nearly 200&#8197;years after its discovery by Justus von Liebig. Moreover, several salts of ammeline were synthesized and structurally characterized to study its amphoteric behavior and the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure in the solid. Finally, the potential of ammeline as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials was examined.







Abstract
Ammeline is a simple, readily available, molecular compound, which has been known for nearly 200&#8197;years. Despite that, no proper structural characterization of ammeline has been conducted so far. For this reason, the prevalent tautomeric form of ammeline in the solid remained unknown to this date. In the course of this study, its crystal structure was finally established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In this structure, ammeline is exclusively found as its 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one tautomer and adopts layered structure with an exceptionally high hydrogen bond density. Ammeline shows an interesting amphoteric behavior. Therefore, the synthesis and structural characterization of some of its salts were carried out to investigate the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure. In particular, the crystal structure of silver ammelinate monohydrate was solved as the first reported structure containing deprotonated ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three different modifications of ammelinium perchlorate were elucidated and the transformation conditions between them were studied. Lastly, the crystal structure of ammelinediium diperchlorate monohydrate, containing unprecedented doubly protonated ammeline, was determined. The products&#8217; thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The perchlorate salts were additionally examined for their potential as insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.

         <title>Transient Covalent Polymers through Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient covalent polymers generated by chemical fuel reactions should serve as useful model systems for nonequilibrium assembly. Here, aqueous poly(anhydrides) have been generated by treatment of dicarboxylic acid monomers with carbodiimides. Molecular weights over 15,000 have been achieved, with polymer lifetimes on the order of hours to weeks. The effect of solvent, reactant concentrations, and temperature has been examined.







Abstract
Biochemical systems make use of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium polymers generated under kinetic control. Inspired by these systems, many abiotic supramolecular polymers driven by chemical fuel reactions have been reported. Conversely, polymers based on transient covalent bonds have received little attention, even though they have the potential to complement supramolecular systems by generating transient structures based on stronger bonds and by offering a straightforward tuning of reaction kinetics. In this study, we show that simple aqueous dicarboxylic acids give poly(anhydrides) when treated with the carbodiimide EDC. Transient covalent polymers with molecular weights exceeding 15,000 are generated which then decompose over the course of hours to weeks. Disassembly kinetics can be controlled using simple substituent effects in the monomer design. The impact of solvent polarity, carbodiimide concentration, temperature, pyridine concentration, and monomer concentration on polymer properties and lifetimes has been investigated. The results reveal substantial control over polymer assembly and disassembly kinetics, highlighting the potential for fine&#8208;tuned kinetic control in nonequilibrium polymerization systems.

         <title>Coupling CO2 Reduction and Acetyl&#8208;CoA Formation: The Role of a CO Capturing Tunnel in Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase (CODH)/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (ACS) complex couples catalysis at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the generated CO. Hydrophobic sites with affinity for CO within the tunnel act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Our tunnel remodeling suggests that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.







Abstract
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. In this study, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>

We synthesize the rare earth metal Sm SACs on N&#8208;doped carbon substrate. Theoretical calculations and experimental results both indicate that the Sm SACs have the structure of Sm&#8208;N3C3. With this design, the 4f orbital polarizes the 5d orbital, the electronic states near dxz/yz increases, and the d orbital achieves a maximized overlap with the p orbital when interacting with LiPSs, resulting in an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization which provides high activity for accelerating LiPSs reaction kinetics and Li homogeneous deposition.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3&#8201;% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|S/CNTs full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6&#8201;% at 0.2&#8201;C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was devised to access molecules with central and axial chirality with up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalysis was enabled by highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid catalyst composed of carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms is developed for biomolecule electrooxidation. The direct electron transfer between Pt nanoparticles and Mn single atoms as well as the construction of bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators during reaction result in a significant improvement in detection and discrimination performances towards dopamine and uric acid.







Abstract
The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8722;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysts for sensitive sensing platforms.

         <title>Acetal&#8208;thiol Click&#8208;like Reaction: Facile and Efficient Synthesis of Dynamic Dithioacetals and Recyclable Polydithioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction with high conversion, &gt; acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, and high universality, applicable to all typical types of acetals and thiols, was discovered for the facile synthesis of dynamic dithioacetals and readily recyclable polymers without catalyst and solvent. It provides a green and high&#8208;efficient reaction for the sustainable development of organic, polymer, material, medical chemistries, etc.







Abstract
Dithioacetals are heavily used in organic, material and medical chemistries, and exhibit huge potential to synthesize degradable or recyclable polymers. However, the current synthetic approaches of dithioacetals and polydithioacetals are overwhelmingly dependent on external catalysts and organic solvents. Herein, we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction for synthesizing dithioacetals and polydithioacetals. High conversion, higher than acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, can be achieved. High universality was confirmed by monitoring the reactions of linear and cyclic acetals (including renewable bio&#8208;sourced furan&#8208;acetal) with aliphatic and aromatic thiols, and the reaction mechanism of monomolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and auto&#8208;protonation (activation) by thiol was clarified by combining experiments and density functional theory computation. Subsequently, we utilize this reaction to synthesize readily recyclable polydithioacetals. By simple heating and stirring, linear polydithioacetals with

w of ~110&#8197;kDa were synthesized from acetal and dithiol, and depolymerization into macrocyclic dithioacetal and repolymerization into polydithioacetal can be achieved; through reactive extrusion, a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer dynamic network with excellent mechanical properties and continuous reprocessability was prepared from poly(vinyl butyral) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). This green and high&#8208;efficient synthesis method for dithioacetals and polydithioacetals is beneficial to the sustainable development of chemistry.

         <title>A Cyclometalated Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces Oncosis for Synergistic Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus and mitochondria dual&#8208;localized ruthenium(II) complex disrupts DNA to activate PARP1 protein combined with ATP consumption and produces mitochondrial oxidative stress, triggering porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 protein to induce cell oncosis and boosting innate and adaptive immunity.







Abstract
An optimal cancer chemotherapy regimen should effectively address the drug resistance of tumors while eliciting antitumor&#8208;immune responses. Research has shown that non&#8208;apoptotic cell death, such as pyroptosis and ferroptosis, can enhance the immune response. Despite this, there has been limited investigation and reporting on the mechanisms of oncosis and its correlation with immune response. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Ru(II) complex that targeted the nucleus and mitochondria to induce cell oncosis. Briefly, the Ru(II) complex disrupts the nucleus and mitochondria DNA, which active polyADP&#8208;ribose polymerase&#8197;1, accompanied by ATP consumption and porimin activation. Concurrently, mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress result in the release of Ca2+ ions and increased expression of Calpain&#8197;1. Subsequently, specific pore proteins porimin and Calpain&#8197;1 promote cristae destruction or vacuolation, ultimately leading to cell membrane rupture. The analysis of RNA sequencing demonstrates that the Ru(II) complex can initiate the oncosis&#8208;associated pathway and activate both innate and adaptive immunity. In vivo experiments have confirmed that oncosis promotes dendritic cell maturation and awakens adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also activates the innate immune by inducing the polarization of macrophages towards an M1 phenotype.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Trigger Rapid Charge Transport Channels at the Engineered Interface of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Boosting Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst with advanced performance is developed. Rapid charge transport ways triggered by Ovs at the heterointerface are unveiled by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS). The mechanism of Ovs on this S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is revealed by comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) have been intensively studied in single semiconductor photocatalysts, exploration of intrinsic mechanisms and in&#8208;depth understanding of Ovs in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are still limited. Herein, a novel S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst made from WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 with Ovs at the heterointerface is rationally designed. The microscopic environment and local electronic structure of the S&#8208;scheme heterointerface are well optimized by Ovs. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveals that Ovs trigger additional charge movement routes and therefore increase charge separation efficiency. In addition, Ovs have a synergistic effect on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts. As a result, the optimal photocatalytic performance is significantly improved, surpassing that of single component WO3&#8208;Ov and In2S3 (by 35.5 and 3.9&#8197;times, respectively), as well as WO3/In2S3 heterojunction. This work provides new insight into regulating the photogenerated carrier dynamics at the heterointerface and also helps design highly efficient S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts.

         <title>Fabrication of Coffee&#8208;Ring Nanostructured Membranes for Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization to construct coffee&#8208;ring structured the membrane. These features render 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective filtration area of the membrane, and thereby realizing a 2.7&#8208;fold boost in the MeOH permeance. Moreover, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross&#8208;flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n&#8208;hexane, coffee&#8208;ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~13&#8197;LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite Membranes for High&#8208;Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite is a benchmark membrane material for natural gas upgrading. The membranes were facilely synthesized by adopting the novel FAU&#8208;CHA seeds. An excellent CO2/CH4 separation performance was achieved even under pressure up to 6.1&#8197;MPa. The successful scaled&#8208;up synthesis paves the way for practical applications of zeolite membranes for gas separation.







Abstract
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis condition range significantly constrains scale&#8208;up preparation. Herein, we propose a facile interzeolite conversion approach using the FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis on hollow fiber substrates. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3&#8197;&#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24&#8208;96&#8197;h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending the synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K, the membranes showed an average CO2 permeance of (5.2&#177;0.5)&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 (1530&#8197;GPU), with an average CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity of 143&#177;7. Minimal defects ensure a high selectivity of 126 with a CO2 permeation flux of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 6.1&#8197;MPa feed pressure, far surpassing requirements for industrial applications. The feasibility for successful scale&#8208;up of our approach was further demonstrated by the batch synthesis of 40&#8197;cm&#8208;long hollow fiber SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite membranes exhibiting CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity up to 400 (0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K) without using sweep gas.

         <title>Considerable Piezochromism in All&#8208;Inorganic Zero&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive piezochromism with considerable range of 232&#8197;nm from blue to red is achieved in all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional perovskite nanocrystals through pressure&#8208;modulated self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions, which is very crucial to pressure stability monitoring for facilities working at extreme environments. Furthermore, the highly stable and bright green emission enhanced by over five times is quenched upon decompression.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials refer to a class of matters that alter their photoluminescence (PL) colors in response to the external stimuli, which exhibit promising smart applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optoelectronic memory and pressure&#8208;sensing. However, so far, most reported piezochromic materials have been confined to organic materials or hybrid materials containing organic moieties with limited piezochromic range of less than 100&#8197;nm in visible region. Here, we achieved an intriguing piezochromism in all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals (NCs) with a considerable piezochromic range of 232&#8197;nm because of their unique inorganic rigid structure. The PL energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85&#8197;eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83&#8197;eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range. Pressure&#8208;modulated self&#8208;trapped exciton emission between different energy levels of self&#8208;trapped states within Cs3Cu2Cl5 NCs was the main reason for this piezochromism property. Note that the quenched emission, which is over five times more intense than that in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon decompression. This work provides a promising pressure indicating material, particularly used in pressure stability monitoring for equipment working at extreme environments.

The synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and the strengthened water activation on Cu sites decreases the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO hydrogenation, resulting in superior electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is able to convert nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into reusable ammonia (NH3), offering a green treatment and resource utilization strategy of nitrate wastewater and ammonia synthesis. The conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3 undergoes water dissociation to generate active hydrogen atoms and nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates hydrogenation tandemly. The two relay processes compete for the same active sites, especially under pH&#8208;neutral condition, resulting in the suboptimal efficiency and selectivity in the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;. Herein, we constructed a Cu1&#8208;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst by anchoring Cu single atoms on amorphous iron oxide shell of nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) for the electrochemical NO3RR, achieving an impressive NO3&#8722; removal efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% and NH3 selectivity of 99.2&#8201;% under neutral pH and nitrate concentration of 50&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 NO3&#8722;&#8722;N conditions, greatly surpassing the performance of nZVI counterpart. This superior performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of enhanced NO3&#8722; adsorption on Fe sites and strengthened water activation on single&#8208;atom Cu sites, decreasing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8208;to&#8208;*NOH. This work develops a novel strategy of fabricating dual&#8208;site catalysts to enhance the electrosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722;, and presents an environmentally sustainable approach for neutral nitrate wastewater treatment.

         <title>Allyl&#8208;Allyl Coupling Promoted by Catalyst Systems with two Palladium Atoms &#8211; A Plethora of Potentially Pericyclic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plethora of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in a palladium promoted allyl coupling reaction was explored with quantum chemical computations, with results implying that one should perhaps consider such processes regularly, but do so with caution. The results of these calculations lead to a revision of the mechanism for a recently reported allyl coupling reaction that makes use of an unusual outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination.







Abstract
Recently, Huang and co&#8208;workers reported a catalytic reaction that utilizes H2 as the sole reductant for a C&#8722;C coupling of allyl groups with yields up to 96&#8201;%. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to identify several key features of this reaction that provide clarity on how it proceeds. We propose the involvement of a Pd&#8722;Pd bound dimer precatalyst, demonstrate the importance of ligand &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and counterions, and identify a new, energetically viable, mechanism involving two dimerized, outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination transition structures that determine both the rate and selectivity. Although we rule out the previously proposed transmetalation step on energetic grounds, we show it to have an unusual aromatic transition structure in which two Pd atoms support rearranging electrons. The prevalence of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in this system suggests that one should consider such processes regularly, but the results of our calculations also indicate that one should do so with caution.

         <title>Upgrading Electrolyte Antioxidant Chemistry by Constructing Potential Scaling Relationship</title>

An external method to quantitatively analyze the oxidation stability of electrolyte systems is proposed. It was shown that &#8220;anion&#8208;less&#8221; solvated structures are more resistant to oxidation than &#8220;anion&#8208;rich&#8221; ones owing to the weakening of the anion polarization effect. These findings provide a molecular perspective for electrolyte design in rechargeable high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal Batteries.







Abstract
Rational design of advanced electrolytes to improve the high&#8208;voltage capability has been attracting wide attention as one critical solution to enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the limited understanding of electrolyte antioxidant chemistry as well as the lack of valid quantization approaches have resulted in knowledge gap, which hinders the formulation of new electrolytes. Herein, we construct a standard curve based on representative solvation structures to quantify the oxidation stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes, which reveals the linear correlation between the oxidation potential and the atomic charge of the least oxidation&#8208;resistant solvent. Dictated by the regularity between solvation composition and oxidation potential, a (Trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte dominated by anion&#8208;less solvation structures was designed to optimize the cycling performance of 4.5&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Li||3.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8208;LiCoO2 batteries, which maintained 80&#8201;% capacity retention even after 440 cycles. The consistency of experimental and computational results validates the proposed principles, offering a fundamental guideline to evaluate and design aggressive electrochemical systems.

Elongated flipper probes with one and two alkynes in the core merge flipper&#8208; and rotor&#8208;like behavior to take photophysical properties to a new level of sophistication and introduce hydrophobic matching with one single leaflet as operational strategy to mechanosensitively track bilayer membranes by their thickness.







Abstract
Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems. This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains. The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression. Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity. In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence. Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.

         <title>Are Redox&#8208;Active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry textbooks teach that the behavior of charged redox centers bound by saturated linkers is essentially governed by electrostatics. We show that for short alkanes and pyridiniums, as Coulombic and through&#8208;bond interactions become ineffective, reductive cyclomer formation is governed by London dispersion and &#963;&#8208;type overlap of 2pz atomic orbitals of the C&#947; atoms of electrophoric ends rather than by electron spin&#8208;spin interaction.







Abstract
The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oligo[n]methylene&#8208;bipyridinium assemblies (with n=2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state Z=+2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra&#8208;molecular orbitals (supra&#8208;MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive &#963; bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for Z=+2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that all&#8208;trans and folded conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one&#8208;electron injection, for radical cations (Z=+1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra&#8208;MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra&#8208;MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (Z=0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemistry textbooks teach that the behavior of charged redox centers bound by saturated linkers is essentially governed by electrostatics. We show that for short alkanes and pyridiniums, as Coulombic and through-bond interactions become ineffective, reductive cyclomer formation is governed by London dispersion and &#963;-type overlap of 2p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; atomic orbitals of the C&#947; atoms of electrophoric ends rather than by electron spin-spin interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent to which electrophores covalently bridged by a saturated linker are electrochemically independent was investigated considering the charge/spin duality of the electron and functionality of the electrophore as a spin carrier upon reduction. By combining computational modeling with electrochemical experiments, we investigated the mechanism by which tethered electrophores react together within 4,4&#8242;-oligo[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;]methylene-bipyridinium assemblies (with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2 to 5). We show that native dicationic electrophores (redox state &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=+2) are folded prior to electron injection into the system, allowing the emergence of supra-molecular orbitals (supra-MOs) likely to support the process of the reductive &#963; bond formation giving cyclomers. Indeed, for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=+2, London Dispersion (LD) forces contribute to flatten the potential energy surface such that &lt;i&gt;all-trans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;folded&lt;/i&gt; conformers are approximately isoenergetic. Then, upon one-electron injection, for radical cations (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=+1), LD forces significantly stabilize the folded conformers, except for the ethylene derivative deprived of supra-MOs. For radical cations equipped with supra-MOs, the unpaired electron is delocalized over both heterocycles through space. Cyclomer completion (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=0) upon the second electron transfer occurs according to the inversion of redox potentials. This mechanism explains why intramolecular reactivity is favored and why pyridinium electrophores are not independent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An intriguing bottom&#8208;up molecular engineering approach is revealed toward single&#8208;step synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich laterally&#8208;fused stimuli&#8208;responsive polycyclic heteroarenes, leveraging a highly step&#8208;economic octuple C&#8722;H activation manifold for simultaneous creation of hexagon&#8208;containing planar and heptagon&#8208;containing nonplanar skeletons on readily available triazolium template.







Abstract
Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials. This work presents such an innovative synthetic concept of a bottom&#8208;up molecular topology engineering through a unique orchestrated octuple C&#8722;H activation reaction, toward the rapid synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;incorporated nitrogen&#8208;doped laterally&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds with rarely reported wavy structural configuration. The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.

         <title>Anion Modulation of Ag&#8208;Imidazole Cuboctahedral Cage Microenvironments for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have fabricated three Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral coordination cages (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) which exhibit inner/outside coordination microenvironments, and metal/nonmetal active sites for synergistic enhancement of selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes.







Abstract
How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>

An intelligent PBSC interface is designed on the zinc anode with self&#8208;adaptation and shear&#8208;thickening properties by blending polyborosiloxane (PBS) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The reversible association/disassociation of dynamic B&#8722;O bonds enhances local structural integrity, effectively impeding continuous zinc dendrite growth and mitigating hydrogen evolution, ensuring stable zinc plating/stripping behaviors with enhanced cycling performance.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8722;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8722;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.

         <title>Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of transistor integration, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining NS in conductive polymer reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete nanoreactor units bonded on CNTs. Meanwhile, excellent performance is achieved through tandem connection with CNTs, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs.







Abstract
Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP&#8208;NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C and 918&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8201;C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011&#8201;% is achieved at a current density of 1&#8201;C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

     alt="Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the concept of transistor integration, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining NS in conductive polymer reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete nanoreactor units bonded on CNTs. Meanwhile, excellent performance is achieved through tandem connection with CNTs, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP-NRs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP-NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP-NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8201;C and 918&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8201;C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011&#8201;% is achieved at a current density of 1&#8201;C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high-performance energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Industrial&#8208;Scale Hard Carbon Designed to Regulate Electrochemical Polarization for Fast Sodium Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile but scalable strategy to decrease electrochemical polarization by accurately regulating multiple structural features for industrial&#8208;scale hard carbon enabling rapid sodium storage is proposed via adjusting the components of precursors.







Abstract
Given the merits of abundant resource, low cost and high electrochemical activity, hard carbons have been regarded as one of the most commercializable anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, poor rate capability is one of the main obstacles that severely hinder its further development. In addition, the relationships between preparation method, material structure and electrochemical performance have not been clearly elaborated. Herein, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to accurately construct the multiple structural features in hard carbon via adjusting the components of precursors. Through detailed physical characterization of the hard carbons derived from different regulation steps, and further combined with in&#8208;situ Raman and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) analysis, the network of multiple relationships between preparation method, microstructure, sodium storage behavior and electrochemical performance have been successfully established. Simultaneously, exceptional rate capability about 108.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 have been achieved from RHC sample with high reversible capacity and desirable initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Additionally, the practical applications can be extended to cylindrical battery with excellent cycle behaviors. Such facile approach can provide guidance for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;performance hard carbons and provides the possibility of building practical SIBs with high energy density and durability.

         <title>Tuning Adsorbate&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction by Oxygen Vacancy: A Case Study in Ru/TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the initial oxygen vacancy concentration of a catalyst supports can regulate the formation of adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) and its stability under reaction conditions. The concept is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation on Ru/TiO2.







Abstract
The adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) offers a reversible means of altering the selectivity of supported metal catalysts, thereby providing a powerful tool for facile modulation of catalytic performance. However, the fundamental understanding of A&#8208;SMSI remains inadequate and methods for tuning A&#8208;SMSI are still in their nascent stages, impeding its stabilization under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the initial concentration of oxygen vacancy in oxide supports plays a key role in tuning the A&#8208;SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and defected titania (TiO2&#8208;x). Based on this new understanding, we demonstrate the in situ formation of A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions, obviating the typically required CO2&#8208;rich pretreatment. The as&#8208;formed A&#8208;SMSI layer exhibits remarkable stability at various temperatures, enabling excellent activity, selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalyzing the reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction. This study deepens the understanding of the A&#8208;SMSI and the ability to stabilize A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions represents a key step for practical catalytic applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;component Copolymerized Donors enable Frozen Nano&#8208;morphology and Superior Ductility for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of efficient multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) P10.8/P20.2, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl, P10.7/P20.3&#8208;TCl, and P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl were synthesized, and excellent efficiencies in both rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs along with fracture strain in pristine film (16.59&#8201;%) for P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl were achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) have gained significant interest and have been rapidly developed in flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) in recent years. However, ensuring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;OSCs while retaining ideal mechanical properties remains an enormous challenge. The fracture strain (FS) value of typical high&#8208;efficiency blend films is generally less than 8&#8201;%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end&#8208;capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs, along with excellent FS values (16.59&#8201;%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding FS values of 25.18&#8201;% and 12.3&#8201;% were achieved by P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl &#8208;based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end&#8208;capped MCD&#8208;based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyses Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus x media cell cultures, is functionally characterized to efficiently catalyze oxetane ring formation in paclitaxel biosynthesis. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding and isotope labelling experiments together with density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus&#215;media cell cultures, has been functionally characterized to efficiently catalyse the formation of the oxetane ring in tetracyclic taxoids. Transient expression of TmCYP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana using 2&#945;,5&#945;,7&#946;,9&#945;,10&#946;,13&#945;&#8208;hexaacetoxytaxa&#8208;4(20),11(12)&#8208;diene (1) as a substrate led to the production of a major oxetane derivative, 1&#946;&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1&#8201;a), and a minor 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide derivative, baccatin I (1&#8201;b). However, feeding the substrate decinnamoyltaxinine J (2), a 5&#8208;deacetylated derivative of 1, yielded only 5&#945;&#8208;deacetylbaccatin I (2&#8201;b), a 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding, 2H and 18O isotope labelling experiments, and density functional theory calculations. This reaction could be an intramolecular oxidation&#8208;acetoxyl rearrangement and the construction of the oxetane ring may occur through a concerted process; however, the 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide might be a shunt product. In this process, the C5&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group in substrate is crucial for the oxetane ring formation but not for the 4(20)&#8208;epoxy ring formation by TmCYP1. These findings provide a better understanding of the enzymatic formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxetane synthase (&lt;i&gt;Tm&lt;/i&gt;CYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from &lt;i&gt;Taxus&#215;media&lt;/i&gt; cell cultures, has been functionally characterized to efficiently catalyse the formation of the oxetane ring in tetracyclic taxoids. Transient expression of &lt;i&gt;TmCYP1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; using 2&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,5&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,7&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,9&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,10&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,13&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-hexaacetoxytaxa-4(20),11(12)-diene (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) as a substrate led to the production of a major oxetane derivative, 1&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-dehydroxybaccatin IV (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;), and a minor 4&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,20-epoxide derivative, baccatin I (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;). However, feeding the substrate decinnamoyltaxinine J (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), a 5-deacetylated derivative of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, yielded only 5&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-deacetylbaccatin I &lt;b&gt;(2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), a 4&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,20-epoxide. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate-feeding, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope labelling experiments, and density functional theory calculations. This reaction could be an intramolecular oxidation-acetoxyl rearrangement and the construction of the oxetane ring may occur through a concerted process; however, the 4&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;,20-epoxide might be a shunt product. In this process, the C5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl group in substrate is crucial for the oxetane ring formation but not for the 4(20)-epoxy ring formation by &lt;i&gt;Tm&lt;/i&gt;CYP1. These findings provide a better understanding of the enzymatic formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;production of Benzoquinone and H2 Using Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a heterogeneous nano&#8208;electrocatalyst consisting of Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF was synthesized using a partial vulcanization method for composition design. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrochemical oxidation performance of phenol (EOP). The self&#8208;assembled alkali&#8208;acid hybrid electrolytic cell can operate continuously for more than 300&#8197;hours at a fixed potential of 0.9&#8197;V. At the same time, through the design and equipment integration of the alkali&#8208;acid electrolytic cell, for the very first time, the anodic oxidation of phenol organic pollutants with the cathodic hydrogen production.







Abstract
In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions. Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60&#8197;V was applied to produce a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90&#8197;V for 12&#8197;days, showing remarkable long&#8208;term stability. The unique configuration of the acid&#8208;base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Donor1&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor2 Motifs Regulating Local Charge of Intercalated Single Cobalt Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Amongst, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF exhibited exceptional activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) by various bipyridines. The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structure can induce the oriented electron transfer from dual donors to the Co center, promoting CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance. Herein, intercalated single Co sites coordinated by imine&#8208;N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties via a molecular engineering strategy. It is confirmed that the charge delivery property and local charge distribution of these heterometallic frameworks can be profoundly influenced by electronic structures. Among these featured structures with mixed&#8208;state copper clusters, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) ratio by changing various bipyridines. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structures facilitate the formation of a highly separated electron&#8208;hole state, which effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from dual electron donors to Co centers, achieving an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. This work opens up an avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>An In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Tag&#8208;Generation Proximity Labeling Technology for Recording Cellular Interactions</title>

We propose an &#8220;in&#8208;situ&#8208;tag&#8208;generation mechanism&#8221; and develop the GalTag technology based on galactose oxidase (GAO) for recording cellular interactions. GAO mounted on bait cells can in situ generate bio&#8208;orthogonal aldehyde tags as interaction reporters on prey cells. GalTag is unique in that it eliminates the need to add tag molecules, resulting in the ability to record bait footprints in three&#8208;dimensional biological solid regions.







Abstract
Obtaining information about cellular interactions is fundamental to the elucidation of physiological and pathological processes. Proximity labeling technologies have been widely used to report cellular interactions in situ; however, the reliance on addition of tag molecules typically restricts their application to regions where tags can readily diffuse, while the application in, for example, solid tissues, is susceptible. Here, we propose an &#8220;in&#8208;situ&#8208;tag&#8208;generation mechanism&#8221; and develop the GalTag technology based on galactose oxidase (GAO) for recording cellular interactions within three&#8208;dimensional biological solid regions. GAO mounted on bait cells can in situ generate bio&#8208;orthogonal aldehyde tags as interaction reporters on prey cells. Using GalTag, we monitored the dynamics of cellular interactions and assessed the targeting ability of engineered cells. In particular, we recorded, for the first time, the footprints of Bacillus Calmette&#8208;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) invasion into the bladder tissue of living mice, providing a valuable perspective to elucidate the anti&#8208;tumor mechanism of BCG.

         <title>Surfactant Directionally Assembled at the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Facilitating Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant&#8208;modified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces have been designed for cathodic catalytic conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Under the application potential conditions, the surfactant undergoes a conformational transition from random distribution to directional assembly. This microenvironmental regulation strategy achieves efficient hydrogenation of HMF and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a promising alternative to conventional thermal processes. Both the catalyst and electrolyte deeply impact the performance. Designing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity. Here, we employ the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a reaction model.

     alt="Surfactant Directionally Assembled at the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface for Facilitating Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Hydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant-modified electrode-electrolyte interfaces have been designed for cathodic catalytic conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Under the application potential conditions, the surfactant undergoes a conformational transition from random distribution to directional assembly. This microenvironmental regulation strategy achieves efficient hydrogenation of HMF and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is a promising alternative to conventional thermal processes. Both the catalyst and electrolyte deeply impact the performance. Designing the electrode-electrolyte interface remains challenging due to its compositional and structural complexity. Here, we employ the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a reaction model. The typical cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and its analogs are employed as electrolyte additives to tune the interfacial microenvironment, delivering high-efficiency hydrogenation of HMF and inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The surfactants experience a conformational transformation from stochastic distribution to directional assembly under applied potential. This oriented arrangement hampers the transfer of water molecules to the interface and promotes the enrichment of reactants. In addition, near 100&#8201;% 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) selectivity is achieved, and the faradaic efficiency (FE) of the BHMF is improved from 61&#8201;% to 74&#8201;% at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the microenvironmental modulation strategy applies to a range of electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions involving aldehyde substrates. This work paves the way for engineering advanced electrode-electrolyte interfaces and boosting unsaturated alcohol electrosynthesis efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Selective Dissolution of Coinage Metals in Recyclable Ionic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au can be sequentially dissolved from waste electrical and electronic equipment using green oxidants: aqueous H2O2 and Oxone in biomass&#8208;derived sustainable and recyclable ionic media: lactic acid and deep eutectic solvent made of choline chloride and urea. This sequential one metal &#8211; one method recycling approach closely follows efforts for the security of supply and objectives of circular economy and sustainable development.







Abstract
Coinage metals Cu, Ag, and Au are essential for modern electronics and their recycling from waste materials is becoming increasingly important to guarantee the security of their supply. Designing new sustainable and selective procedures that would substitute currently used processes is crucial. Here, we describe an unprecedented approach for the sequential dissolution of single metals from Cu, Ag, and Au mixtures using biomass&#8208;derived ionic solvents and green oxidants. First, Cu can be selectively dissolved in the presence of Ag and Au with a choline chloride/urea/H2O2 mixture, followed by the dissolution of Ag in lactic acid/H2O2. Finally, the metallic Au, which is not soluble in either solution above, is dissolved in choline chloride/urea/Oxone. Subsequently, the metals were simply and quantitatively recovered from dissolutions, and the solvents were recycled and reused. The applicability of the developed approach was demonstrated by recovering metals from electronic waste substrates such as printed circuit boards, gold fingers, and solar panels. The dissolution reactions and selectivity were explored with different analytical techniques and DFT calculations. We anticipate our approach will pave a new way for the contemporary and sustainable recycling of multi&#8208;metal waste substrates.

         <title>Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril Receptors Function as Solid State Sequestrants for Organic Micropollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In previous work, we showed that water soluble acyclic cucurbit[n]uril hosts function well as in vivo sequestrants for biologically active substances. Herein, we synthesize a series of water insoluble 3,6&#8208;dimethylcatechol walled acyclic CB[n] and demonstrate their function as solid state sequestrants for organic micropollutants.







Abstract
The accumulation of organic micropollutants (OMP) in aquatic systems is a major societal problem that can be addressed by approaches including nanofiltration, flocculation, reverse osmosis and adsorptive methods using insoluble materials (e.g. activated carbon, MOFs, nanocomposites). More recently, polymeric versions of supramolecular hosts (e.g. cyclodextrins, calixarenes, pillararenes) have been investigated as OMP sequestrants. Herein, we report our study of the use of water insoluble dimethylcatechol walled acyclic cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) hosts as solid state sequestrants for a panel of five OMPs. A series of hosts (H1&#8211;H4) were synthesized by reaction of glycoluril oligomer (monomer&#8211;tetramer) with 3,6&#8208;dimethylcatechol and fully characterized by spectroscopic means and x&#8208;ray crystallography. The solid hosts sequester OMPs from water with removal efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% in some cases. The removal efficiencies of the new hosts parallel the known molecular recognition properties of analogous water soluble acyclic CB[n]. OMP uptake by solid host occurs rapidly (&#8776;120&#8197;seconds). Head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with CB[6] in batch&#8208;mode separation and DARCO activated carbon in flow&#8208;through separation mode show that tetramer derived host (H4) performs very well under identical conditions. The work establishes insoluble acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors as a promising new platform for OMP sequestration.

         <title>Elevated Water Oxidation by Cation Leaching Enabled Tunable Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 with a spinel structure, activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning, demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity among NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 homologue catalysts in alkaline conditions. The activation of the initially inactive spinel is due to surface reconstruction facilitated by Cr leaching, resulting in a core&#8211;shell structure with cation vacancies. This catalyst shows exceptional activity and stability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at 80&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Water electrolysis is one promising and eco&#8208;friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best&#8208;performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500&#8201;% current density promotion at overpotential &#951;=300&#8197;mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni&#8201;:&#8201;Fe ratio rather than considering the contribution of Cr. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large&#8208;scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

In mixed&#8208;valent systems , an anti&#8208;symmetric motion leads to electron localisation on or electron transfer between the redox centers. In their Research Article (e202404727), Adam &#352;rut, Benjamin&#8197;J. Lear and Vera Krewald et&#8197;al. show that additionally, a symmetric motion is present in bridged systems: it is responsible for the characteristic shape of the inter&#8208;valence charge transfer band. The close relationship between the two motions is represented by one surface being the shadow of the other.

An all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskite featuring a considerable piezochromic range of 232 nm is reported by Guanjun Xiao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406015). The cover picture describes an intriguing pressure&#8208;induced piezochromic behavior in typical Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals by using diamond anvil cell. The emission energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85&#8197;eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83&#8197;eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range, thus providing a promising naked&#8208;eye visual pressure monitoring and sensing &#8220;chameleon".

         <title>Inside Cover: Are Redox&#8208;Active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent? (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 31/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
Under the action of London dispersion forces, the fluxional intramolecular medium of redox&#8208;active bipartite molecules reorganizes to promote through&#8208;space orbital overlap between electrophoric subunits, allowing the achievement of prototypical cyclomer reductive formation. Overall, this behavior provides an illustration of electrochemistry &#8220;beyond the covalent bond&#8221;, just beyond! Details of this study are reported in the Research Article by &#201;ric Br&#233;mond, Magdal&#233;na Hromadov&#225;, Philippe&#8197;P. Lain&#233; et&#8197;al. (e202406299).

In the presence of lysozyme , the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange and partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates. Eugenio Garribba, Antonello Merlino et al. report in this Communication (e202406669) the X&#8208;ray structures of three mixed&#8208;valence species: [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which interacts non&#8208;covalently with the protein, and [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which are covalently bound.

         <title>Halogen, Chalcogen, Pnictogen, and Tetrel Bonding in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis: An Update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments on the use of non&#8208;transient non&#8208;covalent interactions based on elements of groups 14&#8211;17 in organic synthesis and organocatalysis are discussed. While halogen and chalcogen bonding are now clearly established in this area, applications of pnictogen and particularly tetrel bonding are only starting to emerge.







Abstract
The use of noncovalent interactions based on electrophilic halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, or tetrel centers in organocatalysis has gained noticeable attention. Herein, we provide an overview on the most important developments in the last years with a clear focus on experimental studies and on catalysts which act via such non&#8208;transient interactions.

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an introduction on the recent progresses made in the field of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for various applications including adsorption/separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and energy storage.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi's group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Applications of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses the progress in covalent organic framework nanosheets, with a focus on studies that compare the performance of covalent organic nanosheets (CONs) with covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by demonstrating the impact of thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. The applications of CONs in components of batteries, as well as in biomedical applications, sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are two&#8208;dimensional, crystalline porous framework materials with numerous scopes for tunability, such as porosity, functionality, stability and aspect ratio (thickness to length ratio). The manipulation of &#960;&#8208;stacking in COFs results in truly 2D materials, namely covalent organic nanosheets (CONs), adds advantages in many applications. In this Minireview, we have discussed both top&#8208;down (COFs&#8594;CONs) and bottom&#8208;up (molecules&#8594;CONs) approaches with precise information on thickness and lateral growth. We have showcased the research progress on CONs in a few selected applications, such as batteries, catalysis, sensing and biomedical applications. This Minireview specifically highlights the reports where the authors compare the performance of CONs with COFs by demonstrating the impact of the thickness and lateral growth of the nanosheets. We have also provided the possible scope of exploration of CONs research in terms of inter&#8208;dimensional conversion, such as graphene to carbon nanotube and future technologies.

         <title>Stereoinvertive SN1 Through Neighboring Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel classification for stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution through neighboring group participation is presented. Three disctinct modes have been identified: Inversion via Rearrangements, Invertive Intermediate&#8208;Retentive Ring&#8208;opening and Retentive Intermediate&#8208;Invertive Substitution. In each instance, we have elucidated the fundamental principles underlying the stereochemistry and provided representative examples to illustrate the concepts.







Abstract
Neighboring group participation, the assistance of non&#8208;conjugated electrons to a reaction center, is a fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. In the framework of nucleophilic substitution reactions, neighboring group participation is known to cause rate acceleration, first order kinetics (SN1), and retention of configuration. The latter phenomenon is a result of double inversion: the first one when the neighboring group displaces the leaving group, and the second when a nucleophile substitutes the neighboring group. This powerful control of stereoretention has been widely used in organic synthesis for more than a century. However, neighboring group participation may also lead to inversion of configuration, a phenomenon which is often overlooked. Herein, we review this unique mode of stereoinversion, dividing the relevant reactions into three classes with the aim to introduce a fresh perspective on the different modes of stereoinversion via neighboring group participation as well as the factors that control this stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Strained Amino Acids by a PLP&#8208;Dependent Enzyme through Cryptic Halogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogenases enable organisms to alter the reactivity of a biological substrate by enzymatically installing a leaving group. In this communication, we discover a bacterial gene cluster which uses a pyridoxal 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme to form strained carbocyclic amino acids from halogenated substrates. We also examine the role of the non&#8208;canonical amino acid pazamine in plant&#8208;bacterial interactions.







Abstract
Amino acids (AAs) are modular building blocks which nature uses to synthesize both macromolecules, such as proteins, and small molecule natural products, such as alkaloids and non&#8208;ribosomal peptides. While the 20 main proteinogenic AAs display relatively limited side chain diversity, a wide range of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) exist that are not used by the ribosome for protein synthesis, but contain a broad array of structural features and functional groups. In this communication, we report the discovery of the biosynthetic pathway for a new ncAA, pazamine, which contains a cyclopropane ring formed in two steps. In the first step, a chlorine is added onto the C4 position of lysine by a radical halogenase, PazA. The cyclopropane ring is then formed in the next step by a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme, PazB, via an SN2&#8208;like attack at C4 to eliminate chloride. Genetic studies of this pathway in the native host, Pseudomonas azotoformans, show that pazamine potentially inhibits ethylene biosynthesis in growing plants based on alterations in the root phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. We further show that PazB can be utilized to make an alternative cyclobutane&#8208;containing AA. These discoveries may lead to advances in biocatalytic production of specialty chemicals and agricultural biotechnology.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>

An ionic hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted carbene organocatalytic approach to afford a wide range of chiral N(V)&#8208;stereogenic N&#8208;oxide products is disclosed by formal desymmetrization of remote diols.







Abstract
The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid degradation without photoirradiation. Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;X, are chemiexcited through autoxidation, leading to amyloid&#8208;selective oxygenation in the dark. Oxygenated A&#946; furnishes reduced aggregation potency and cytotoxicity. The chemiexcitation strategy may be effective in treating amyloidosis by alleviating pathogenetic amyloids accumulated deep in the brain, where light hardly reaches.







Abstract
Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.

         <title>H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;Derived Chiral &#951;6&#8208;Benzene Ligands: New Opportunities for the Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of (S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene ligands has been developed, which can coordinate with ruthenium(II) highly site&#8208;selectively.The related chiral ruthenium(II) catalysts proved highly effective for the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a series of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Given the tremendous success of (p&#8208;cymene)RuII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20&#8197;years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort. Here we present a novel class of axially chiral Ben ligands derived from readily available (S)&#8208;5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;,8,8&#8242;&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol ((S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL) in 4&#8211;8 steps. Notably, when coordinated with ruthenium, such chiral Ben ligand containing three benzene rings only forms one of the three possible isomeric BenRuII complexes. The related chiral BenRuII catalysts could effectively catalyze the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a range of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99&#8201;% yield with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. These catalysts are expected to find broad applications in future.

         <title>Engineered Phenylalanine Ammonia&#8208;Lyases for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Aspartic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8208;based engineering of phenylalanine ammonia&#8208;lyase from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL) is conducted for preparative&#8208;scale enantioselective hydroaminations of previously inaccessible yet synthetically useful substrates, such as amide&#8208; and ester&#8208;containing fumaric acid derivatives. Our engineered PbPALs exhibit exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, high enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope. The potential utility of the developed biocatalysts is demonstrated by a preparative&#8208;scale hydroamination yielding tert&#8208;butyl protected l&#8208;aspartic acid, widely used as intermediate in peptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis.







Abstract
Biocatalytic hydroamination of alkenes is an efficient and selective method to synthesize natural and unnatural amino acids. Phenylalanine ammonia&#8208;lyases (PALs) have been previously engineered to access a range of substituted phenylalanines and heteroarylalanines, but their substrate scope remains limited, typically including only arylacrylic acids. Moreover, the enantioselectivity in the hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient substrates is often poor. Here, we report the structure&#8208;based engineering of PAL from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL), enabling preparative&#8208;scale enantioselective hydroaminations of previously inaccessible yet synthetically useful substrates, such as amide&#8208; and ester&#8208;containing fumaric acid derivatives. Through the elucidation of cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) PbPAL structure and screening of the structure&#8208;based mutagenesis library, we identified the key active site residue L205 as pivotal for dramatically enhancing the enantioselectivity of hydroamination reactions involving electron&#8208;deficient substrates. Our engineered PALs demonstrated exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, high enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope. The potential utility of the developed biocatalysts was further demonstrated by a preparative&#8208;scale hydroamination yielding tert&#8208;butyl protected l&#8208;aspartic acid, widely used as intermediate in peptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis.

A novel multifunctional photoinitiator that offers precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation (450&#8197;nm) and material degradation (365&#8197;nm) is developed. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured. Furthermore, this photoinitiator facilitates the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures. This represents a promising general strategy for the development of recyclable photoresins for 3D printing.







Abstract
A multifunctional photoinitiator is presented, offering precise control over light&#8208;induced polymerization initiation at 450&#8197;nm and material degradation at 365&#8197;nm. This is accomplished by covalently linking photoactive bis(acyl)phosphane oxide and photocleavable o&#8208;nitrobenzyl ether moieties onto the surface of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re&#8208;dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re&#8208;cured, exhibiting superior mechanical properties compared to the pristine material. Moreover, this photoinitiator enables the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures, representing a promising general strategy for developing recyclable photoresins for 3D printing applications.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective &#948;&#8208;Hydroarylation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes via Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition</title>

         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported, giving Z&#8208;alkene products in &gt;95&#8201;% ee and &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 Z&#8201;:&#8201;E. Protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is likely the slow step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer with MeOH.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate arylations of electron&#8208;poor alkenes are highly selective processes for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. &#948;&#8208;Selective hydroarylations of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes are less well developed and reactions that deliver high enantioselectivity while giving single alkene isomer products are elusive. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes that gives nearly exclusive Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products (generally with &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 positional and geometrical selectivity). This remote functionalization provides access to chiral diarylated alkenes from readily available precursors poised for further functionalization, including in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is the turnover limiting step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer pathway.

         <title>Polymeric Prodrugs using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry for Prolonged Local Anesthesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrodotoxin (TTX) polymeric prodrugs were developed utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry. The reversible reaction between the 1,2&#8197;diol on TTX and phenylboronic acid enabled ex vivo TTX encapsulation with high efficiency (EE%, &gt;90&#8201;%) and sustained TTX release in vivo. The resultant TTX sustained release depots induced prolonged local anesthesia with minimal systemic toxicity.







Abstract
Depot&#8208;type drug delivery systems are designed to deliver drugs at an effective rate over an extended period. Minimizing initial &#8220;burst&#8221; can also be important, especially with drugs causing systemic toxicity. Both goals are challenging with small hydrophilic molecules. The delivery of molecules such as the ultrapotent local anesthetic tetrodotoxin (TTX) exemplifies both challenges. Toxicity can be mitigated by conjugating TTX to polymers with ester bonds, but the slow ester hydrolysis can result in subtherapeutic TTX release. Here, we developed a prodrug strategy, based on dynamic covalent chemistry utilizing a reversible reaction between the diol TTX and phenylboronic acids. These polymeric prodrugs exhibited TTX encapsulation efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% and the resulting polymeric nanoparticles showed a range of TTX release rates. In vivo injection of the TTX polymeric prodrugs at the sciatic nerve reduced TTX systemic toxicity and produced nerve block lasting 9.7&#177;2.0&#8197;h, in comparison to 1.6&#177;0.6&#8197;h from free TTX. This approach could also be used to co&#8208;deliver the diol dexamethasone, which prolonged nerve block to 21.8&#177;5.1&#8197;h. This work emphasized the usefulness of dynamic covalent chemistry for depot&#8208;type drug delivery systems with slow and effective drug release kinetics.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals from Organoboron Reagents Enabled by Pulsed Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed electrosynthesis efficiently converts aromatic organoboron reagents to aryl radicals. Mechanistic studies reveal that pulsed electrosynthesis overcomes challenges like radical grafting/passivation, homocoupling, overoxidation, and decomposition. This electro&#8208;oxidative method enables straightforward functionalization of aromatic organoboron reagents to form aryl C&#8722;P, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Aryl radicals play a pivotal role as reactive intermediates in chemical synthesis, commonly arising from aryl halides and aryl diazo compounds. Expanding the repertoire of sources for aryl radical generation to include abundant and stable organoboron reagents would significantly advance radical chemistry and broaden their reactivity profile. While traditional approaches utilize stoichiometric oxidants or photocatalysis to generate aryl radicals from these reagents, electrochemical conditions have been largely underexplored. Through rigorous mechanistic investigations, we identified fundamental challenges hindering aryl radical generation. In addition to the high oxidation potentials of aromatic organoboron compounds, electrode passivation through radical grafting, homocoupling of aryl radicals, and decomposition issues were identified. We demonstrate that pulsed electrosynthesis enables selective and efficient aryl radical generation by mitigating the fundamental challenges. Our discoveries facilitated the development of the first electrochemical conversion of aryl potassium trifluoroborate salts into aryl C&#8722;P bonds. This sustainable and straightforward oxidative electrochemical approach exhibited a broad substrate scope, accommodating various heterocycles and aryl chlorides, typical substrates in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to form aryl C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds, showcasing its versatility and potential in bond formation processes.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Phenethylamine Synthesis: N&#8208;Pyridinium Aziridines as Latent Dual Electrophiles</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines serve as latent dual electrophiles for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines. Ni&#8208;catalyzed aziridine ring opening with organozinc nucleophiles affords a diverse family of &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts which upon reductive N&#8722;N cleavage provides access to rapid and modular molecular assembly of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Phenethylamines are widely represented in biologically and pharmacologically active organic small molecules. Here, we introduce N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines as latent dual electrophiles for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines. Bromide&#8208;promoted ring opening generates &#946;&#8208;halopyridinium amines. Selective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling between organozinc nucleophiles and the benzylic C&#8722;Br electrophile affords a diverse family of &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts, and coupling is stereoconvergent in the presence of chiral ligands. Subsequent Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive N&#8722;N bond activation within the &#946;&#8208;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts furnishes the products of formal olefin carboamination. Other reductive N&#8722;N cleavage reactions are demonstrated to provide access to free primary amines, alkylated amines, heterocycles, and products derived from N&#8208;centered radical chemistry. The developed reaction sequence can be implemented in the context of complex molecules and natural product derivatives. Together, the described results provide a general and modular synthesis of &#946;&#8208;phenethylamines and significantly expand the utility of N&#8208;pyridinium aziridines as linchpins in chemical synthesis.

Selective Ni-catalyzed C&#8722;C cross-coupling between organozinc nucleophiles and the benzylic C&#8722;Br electrophile affords a diverse family of &lt;i&gt;&#946;-&lt;/i&gt;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts, and coupling is stereoconvergent in the presence of chiral ligands. Subsequent Ni-catalyzed reductive N&#8722;N bond activation within the &lt;i&gt;&#946;-&lt;/i&gt;functionalized phenethylaminopyridinium salts furnishes the products of formal olefin carboamination. Other reductive N&#8722;N cleavage reactions are demonstrated to provide access to free primary amines, alkylated amines, heterocycles, and products derived from &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;centered radical chemistry. The developed reaction sequence can be implemented in the context of complex molecules and natural product derivatives. Together, the described results provide a general and modular synthesis of &lt;i&gt;&#946;-&lt;/i&gt;phenethylamines and significantly expand the utility of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-pyridinium aziridines as linchpins in chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Swelling and Symmetrization in Siliceous Zeolites due to Hydrogen Insertion at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to other atoms or molecules, H2 enters both the pores and the framework cages of siliceous zeolites under high pressure. This results in strong swelling and symmetrization of the structures with very high hydrogen contents of 1.5&#8211;1.7 H2 molecules/SiO2 unit being obtained.







Abstract
Hydrogen and helium saturate the 1D pore systems of the high&#8208;silica (Si/Al&gt;30) zeolites Theta&#8208;One (TON), and Mobile&#8208;Twelve (MTW) at high pressure based on x&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. In TON, a strong 22&#8201;% volume increase occurs above 5&#8197;GPa with a transition from the collapsed P21 to a symmetrical, swelled Cmc21 form linked to an increase in H2 content from 12 H2/unit cell in the pores to 35 H2/unit cell in the pores and in the framework of the material. No transition and continuous collapse of TON is observed in helium indicating that the mechanism of H2 insertion is distinct from other fluids. The insertion of hydrogen in the larger pores of MTW results in a strong 11&#8201;% volume increase at 4.3&#8197;GPa with partial symmetrization followed by a second volume increase of 4.5&#8201;% at 7.5&#8197;GPa, corresponding to increases in hydrogen content from 43 to 67 and then to 93 H2/unit cell. Flexible 1D siliceous zeolites have a very high H2 capacity (1.5 and 1.7 H2/SiO2 unit for TON and MTW, respectively) due to H2 insertion in the pores and the framework, in contrast to other atoms and molecules, thereby providing a mechanism for strong swelling.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent and Covalent Binding of New Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;like Polyoxidovanadate Clusters to Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 31, July 29, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In NaCl solutions and in the presence of lysozyme, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange, partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates with composition [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which bind covalently and non&#8208;covalently to the protein surface.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] from crystals grown in 1.1&#8197;M NaCl, 0.1&#8197;M sodium acetate at pH&#8197;4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which non&#8208;covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722; (this latter based on an unusual {V18O43} cage) which covalently bind the protein. EPR spectroscopy confirms the partial oxidation of VIV to VV and the formation of mixed&#8208;valence species. The results indicate that the interaction with proteins can stabilize the structure of unexpected &#8211; both for dimension and architecture &#8211; POVs, not observed in aqueous solution.

         <title>Biomimetic Activation of N&#8208;Nitrosamides with Red Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release via Mediated Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mediated electron transfer (MET) is fundamental to many biological functions, including cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and enzymatic catalysis. However, leveraging the MET process to enable the release of therapeutic gases has been largely unexplored. Herein, we report the bio&#8208;inspired activation of a series of UV&#8208;absorbing N&#8208;nitrosamide derivatives (NOA) under red light exposure, enabling the quantitative release of nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitter via an MET process. The cornerstone of our design is the covalent linkage of a 2,4&#8208;dinitroaniline moiety, which acts as an electron mediator to the N&#8208;nitrosamide groups. This facilitates efficient electron transfer from the excited palladium(II) meso&#8208;tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) photocatalyst and the selective activation of NOA. Our approach has been validated with distinct photocatalysts and various N&#8208;nitrosamides, including those derived from carbamates, amides, and ureas. Notably, the modulation of the linker length between the electron mediator and N&#8208;nitrosamide groups serves as a regulatory mechanism for controlling NO release kinetics. Moreover, this biomimetic NO release platform demonstrates effective operation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it enables localized delivery of NO under physiological conditions, exhibiting significant anticancer efficacy within the phototherapeutic window and enhanced selectivity towards tumor cells.</dc:description>

The cornerstone of our design is the covalent linkage of a 2,4-dinitroaniline moiety, which acts as an electron mediator to the N-nitrosamide groups. This facilitates efficient electron transfer from the excited palladium(II) meso-tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) photocatalyst and the selective activation of NOA. Our approach has been validated with distinct photocatalysts and various N-nitrosamides, including those derived from carbamates, amides, and ureas. Notably, the modulation of the linker length between the electron mediator and N-nitrosamide groups serves as a regulatory mechanism for controlling NO release kinetics. Moreover, this biomimetic NO release platform demonstrates effective operation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it enables localized delivery of NO under physiological conditions, exhibiting significant anticancer efficacy within the phototherapeutic window and enhanced selectivity towards tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Overall 99% (002) Plane Achieves Extreme and Direct Utilization of 95% Zn Anode and By&#8208;Product as Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn anode protection in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) face great challenges of high Zn utilization rate (i.e., depth of discharge, DOD) and high current density due to the large difficulty in obtaining an extreme overall RTC (relative texture coefficient) of Zn (002) plane. Through the potent interaction of Mn(III)aq and H+ with distinct Zn crystal planes under an electric field, large&#8208;size Zn foils with a breakthrough (002) plane RTC of 99% (i.e., close to Zn single crystal) are electrodeposited on texture&#8208;less substrates, which is also applicable from recycled Zn. The ultra&#8208;high (002) plane RTC remarkably enhances cyclic performance of the Zn anode (70% DOD @ 45.5 mA cm&#8208;2), and the DOD is even up to 95% (@ 28.1 mA cm&#8208;2) with an electrolyte additive of polyaniline. Furthermore, MnO2, the by&#8208;product of electrodeposition, is directly used as cathode of both coin cell and pouch battery, surpassing the cyclic performance exhibited by the majority of Zn||MnO2 batteries in previous instances. These results demonstrate the great potential of our strategy for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thorium, a predominant actinide in the Earth's crust, presents significant environmental and health risks due to its radioactive nature. These risks are particularly pronounced during the mining and processing of monazite for rare earth elements (REEs), which contain substantial thorium concentrations. Current instrumental analysis methods for thorium, offer high accuracy but require laborious sample preparation and expensive instruments, making them unsuitable for on&#8208;site analysis. Herein, we present a class of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as fluorochromic sensors for Th4+ cations. Utilizing a heterobimetallic Eu3+/Tb3+ doping strategy, the luminescence colors of EuxTb1&#8211;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH can be finely tuned from red, to orange, and to green. More intriguingly, the higher Lewis acidity of Th4+ facilitates the transformation of EuxTb1&#8211;x&#8208;BDC&#8208;OH into a UiO&#8208;type Th&#8208;MOF via a dissolution&#8208;recrystallization mechanism. This process results in a gradual reduction of characteristic Ln3+ emissions and the emergence of blue color ligand&#8208;based fluorescence, thereby leading to selective fluorochromic responses with increasing Th4+ concentrations and enabling visible detection of Th4+ cations. Additionally, a custom&#8208;built portable optoelectronic device was fabricated, which directly converts luminescence colors into red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) values. This device enables easy quantification of Th4+ concentrations without the need for complex instrumentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Lithium Nucleophiles Enabled by Molecularly Defined Alkynyllithium Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilithium tetraalkinyl palladates formed in situ from palladium salts and lithium alkynyls effectively promote the coupling of non&#8208;activated aryl chlorides with various nucleophiles with C&#8722;C or C&#8722;N bond formation. The applicability of the protocol has been demonstrated by the synthesis of 49 molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The lithium alkinyls act as highly electron rich ligands that seem to be widely inert under the basic reaction conditions.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings of aryl chlorides usually call for bulky, electron&#8208;rich ligands such as phosphines or heterocyclic carbenes. We have now found that similarly powerful cross&#8208;coupling catalysts are obtained by the reaction of palladium salts with alkynyllithium reagents. The species initially formed in this process was characterized as a dilithium tetraalkinyl palladate complex. It catalyzes the coupling of aryl chlorides with the lithium salts of various terminal alkynes to give alkynyl arenes. The isolated Li&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;Pd complex also efficiently promotes the reaction of aryl, and allyl chlorides with (hetero)aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208;, and allyllithium compounds as well as lithium amides. None of these reactions proceeded in the presence of palladium salts alone. The preparative utility of this approach was demonstrated by the synthesis of 49&#8197;molecules, including pharmaceutically relevant compounds.

         <title>Rational Understanding Hydroxide Diffusion Mechanism in Anion Exchange Membranes during Electrochemical Processes with RDAnalyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to analyze and decouple hydroxide diffusion mechanism in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) during electrochemical processes. Our simulations show that the majority of hydroxides follow the associated Grotthuss diffusion mechanism in the model system.







Abstract
Enhancing the understanding of hydroxide transport mechanisms in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is beneficial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs in the renewable energy system. However, the high complexity and lack of adequate analytic tools make it challenging to clarify different mechanisms unambiguously. Herein, we developed an in&#8208;house toolkit, the Reactive Diffusion Analyzer (RDAnalyzer), to conduct an effective analysis of hydroxide diffusion mechanisms from ReaxFF molecular dynamic simulations. Using the experimentally well&#8208;synthesized T20NC6NC5N as a model system, we successfully decoupled the hydroxide diffusion mechanisms into free Vehicular and free Grotthuss, as well as associated Vehicular and associated Grotthuss, which was not yet achieved previously. Meanwhile, RDAnalyzer managed to specifically identify the drift length of hydroxide species for each mechanism under the electric field, which worked as a useful variable for calculating the conductivity of AEMs. Our theoretically predicted conductivity for T20NC6NC5N agrees reasonably with experimental results, indicating the reliability of RDAnalyzer. This work not only provides a rational understanding of the complex hydroxide diffusion mechanisms in AEMs but also holds the potential to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance AEMs with computations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Peptide Assemblies for Multi&#8208;Pathway Cell Death and Tumor Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by copper peptides in human plasma, we designed a ferrocene&#8208;capped self&#8208;assembling peptide, FcGH. It can self&#8208;assemble through two different pathways: spontaneous self&#8208;assembly and Cu2+&#8208;induced. By controlling the amount of Cu2+ added, these pathways can form adjustable assembly morphologies and generate different biological effects.







Abstract
Although self&#8208;assembly has emerged as an effective tool for fabricating biomaterials, achieving precise control over the morphologies and functionalities of the resultant assemblies remains an ongoing challenge. Inspired by the copper peptide naturally present in human plasma, in this study, we designed a synthetic precursor, FcGH. FcGH can self&#8208;assemble via two distinct pathways: spontaneous and Cu2+&#8208;induced. These two assembly pathways enabled the formation of assemblies with tunable morphologies by adjusting the amount of added Cu2+. We found that the nanoparticles formed by Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency than the wormlike fibers formed spontaneously. Moreover, this Cu2+&#8208;induced assembly process occurred spontaneously at a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Cu2+ to FcGH, avoiding the excessive use of Cu2+ and a tedious preparation procedure. By co&#8208;assembling with 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)&#8208;conjugated FcGH, Cu2+&#8208;induced supramolecular nanodrugs elicited multiple cell death modalities in cancer cells with elevated immunogenicity, enhancing the therapeutic effect compared to free HCPT. This study highlights Cu2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly as an efficient tool for directing the assembly of nanodrugs and for synergistic tumor therapy.

         <title>Identification and Characterization of Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent Lyases with an Unusual CDG Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical sequence GDG(X)24&#8208;27N, is the fingerprint of ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We have characterized a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE) with an unusual cysteine replacing the first glycine of this motif. We unravel an unexpected function for the atypical cysteine and establish JanthE for valuable biocatalytic applications and as a model for mechanistic studies.







Abstract
The thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;binding motif, characterized by the canonical GDG(X)24&#8208;27N sequence, is highly conserved among ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes. We investigated a ThDP&#8208;dependent lyase (JanthE from Janthinobacterium sp. HH01) with an unusual cysteine (C458) replacing the first glycine of this motif. JanthE exhibits a high substrate promiscuity and accepts long aliphatic &#945;&#8208;keto acids as donors. Sterically hindered aromatic aldehydes or non&#8208;activated ketones are acceptor substrates, giving access to a variety of secondary and tertiary alcohols as carboligation products. The crystal structure solved at a resolution of 1.9&#8197;&#197; reveals that C458 is not primarily involved in cofactor binding as previously thought for the canonical glycine. Instead, it coordinates methionine 406, thus ensuring the integrity of the active site and the enzyme activity. In addition, we have determined the long&#8208;sought genuine tetrahedral intermediates formed with pyruvate and 2&#8208;oxobutyrate in the pre&#8208;decarboxylation states and deciphered the atomic details for their stabilization in the active site. Collectively, we unravel an unexpected role for the first residue of the ThDP&#8208;binding motif and unlock a family of lyases that can perform valuable carboligation reactions.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationships of the Structural Analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 in the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 establish a solid foundation for designing highly efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer new insights into the mechanism of CO2 activity at the atomic level.







Abstract
Owing to the significant attention directed toward alloy metal nanoclusters, it is crucial to explore the relationship between their structures and their performance during the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and discover potential synergistic effects for the design of novel functional nanoclusters. However, a lack of suitable analogs makes this investigation challenging. In this study, we synthesized a well&#8208;defined pair of structural analogs, [Au8Cu1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ and [Au8Ag1(SAdm)4(Dppm)3Cl]2+ (Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1, respectively), and characterized them. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that Au8M1 (M=Cu/Ag) consists of a tetrahedral Au3M1 core capped by three (Dppm)Au staples, one Au2(SR)3 staple, one lone SR ligand, and a terminal Cl ligand. Ag and Cu were doped at the same site in the Au8M1 nanoclusters, which has rarely been reported. Au8Cu1 exhibited a significantly higher CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO; ~82.2&#8201;%) during eCO2RR than that of Au8Ag1 (FECO; ~33.1&#8201;%). Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that *COOH is the key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO. The formation of *COOH on Au8Cu1 is more thermodynamically stable than on Au8Ag1, and Au8Cu1 shows a smaller *CO formation energy than that on Au8Ag1, which promotes the reduction of CO2. We believe that the structural analogs Au8Cu1 and Au8Ag1 offer a suitable template for the in&#8208;depth investigation of structure&#8208;property correlations at the atomic level.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bltter&#8208;pyr radical/cobalt interface is investigated. We found that changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allows screening, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.







Abstract
In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces given their potential applications in spintronics.

         <title>Pyridazine&#8208;Promoted Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Exceptional Capability of Stepwise Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two COFs with non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages were successfully constructed using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine in Knoevenagel condensation, with high crystallinity, large surface areas, and finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;channels decorated with substantial cis&#8208;azo moieties, which exhibited exceptionally stepwise water uptake capacity.







Abstract
In this study, we successfully developed two novel vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using 2&#8208;connected 3,6&#8208;dimethylpyridazine through Knoevenagel condensation. These COFs featured finely tailored micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;scale pore sizes, high surface areas and stable non&#8208;polar vinylene linkages. Finely resolved powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns demonstrated highly crystalline structures with a hexagonal lattice in the AA layer stacking. The resulting one&#8208;dimensional channels possess strong hydrogen&#8208;bond accepting sites arising from the decorated cis&#8208;azo/azine units with two pairs of fully exposed lone pair electrons, endowing the as&#8208;prepared COFs with exceptional water absorption properties. The g&#8208;DZPH&#8208;COF exhibited successive steep water uptake steps starting from low relative pressures (P/PSTA=0.1), with the remarkable water uptake capacity of 0.26&#8197;g/g at P/PSTA=0.2 (25&#8201;&#176;C), which is the optimal value recorded among the reported COFs. Dynamic vapour sorption measurements revealed the fast kinetics of these COFs, even in the cluster formation process. Water uptake and release cycling tests demonstrated their outstanding hydrolytic stability, durability, and adsorption&#8211;desorption retention ability.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of elemental Cl into Bi19Cl3S27 significantly accelerates the electrochemical reconstruction process, inducing the formation of bismuth nanosheets with abundant vacancy defects. These Bi vacancies can aggregate electron density and enhance the adsorption of key intermediates *OCHO, thereby facilitating the production of formate.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, experimental tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 HCOO&#8722; partial current densities, and its electrochemical active surface area normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2&#8197;times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8722; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.

         <title>Structural Mapping of Protein Aggregates in Live Cells Modeling Huntington's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of live Mid&#8208;infrared Photothermal (MIP) Imaging to study protein aggregates in a S. cerevisiae model of Huntington's Disease. MIP enables to distinguish structurally different partitions of aggregates of the protein huntingtin, by scanning across the aggregate and analyzing their MIP amide I band. We revealed that huntingtin aggregates are organized in a &#946;&#8208;sheet rich amyloid core and a shell composed of &#945;&#8208;helical proteins.







Abstract
While protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, acquiring structural information on protein aggregates inside live cells remains challenging. Traditional microscopy does not provide structural information on protein systems. Routinely used fluorescent protein tags, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), might perturb native structures. Here, we report a counter&#8208;propagating mid&#8208;infrared photothermal imaging approach enabling mapping of secondary structure of protein aggregates in live cells modeling Huntington's disease. By comparing mid&#8208;infrared photothermal spectra of label&#8208;free and GFP&#8208;tagged huntingtin inclusions, we demonstrate that GFP fusions indeed perturb the secondary structure of aggregates. By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub&#8208;micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich core and a &#593;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ+] prion state, while [rnq&#8722;] cells only carry smaller &#946;&#8208;rich non&#8208;toxic aggregates. Collectively, our methodology has the potential to unveil detailed structural information on protein assemblies in live cells, enabling high&#8208;throughput structural screenings of macromolecular assemblies.

         <title>Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While numerous experimental investigations underscore the efficacy of pulsed CO2 electrolysis in enhancing productivity, selectivity, and stability, elucidating the underlying mechanisms remains an intricate challenge. However, modeling the boundary layer, assuming steric ion effects and non&#8208;electroneutral conditions, allows us to illuminate dynamic reorganization within the electrode microenvironment.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the field, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today's limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy efficiency when pulsing between &#8722;1.85 and &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by diffusion and not from pH&#8208;induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83&#8201;% compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Cascade Hydrogen Atom Transfers for Assembly of Multi&#8208;Substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H Cyclopentanones</title>

A photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 and &#945;&#8208;SCF2H cyclopentanones. The strengths are multiple including green aspects (atom&#8208;economy, photocatalysis, continuous microflow synthesis). Each step of the reaction mechanism was deciphered by DFT calculations. This work expands the scope of possibilities, which means gaining access to novel fluorinated scaffolds for biological evaluation.







Abstract
A photocatalyzed formal (3+2) cycloaddition has been developed to construct original polysubstituted &#945;&#8208;SCF3 cyclopentanones in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. This building block approach leverages trifluoromethylthio alkynes and branched/linear aldehydes, as readily available reaction partners, in consecutive hydrogen atom transfers and C&#8722;C bond formations. Difluoromethylthio alkynes are also compatible substrates. Furthermore, the potential for telescoped reaction starting from alcohols instead of aldehydes was demonstrated, as well as process automatization and scale&#8208;up under continuous microflow conditions. This prompted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to support a radical&#8208;mediated cascade process.

         <title>Ion Current Rectification Activity Induced by Boron Hydride Nanosheets to Enhance Magnesium Analgesia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic MgB2 nanoparticles are found with potent analgesia, surpassing the efficacy of the clinical MgSO4 and morphine. In pathological environments, MgB2 undergoes hydrolysis, forming borohydride (BH). BH characterized by semimetallic properties and delocalized pi electrons, can alter the behaviors of Na+ and K+ around neurons via pi&#8208;cation interactions, significantly enhancing the magnesium analgesia.







Abstract
The limited analgesic efficiency of magnesium restricts its application in pain management. Here, we report boron hydride (BH) with ion currents rectification activity that can enhance the analgesic efficiency of magnesium without the risks of drug tolerance or addiction. We synthesize MgB2, comprising hexagonal boron sheets alternating with Mg2+. In pathological environment, Mg2+ is exchanged by H+, forming two&#8208;dimensional borophene&#8208;analogue BH sheets. BH interacts with the charged cations via cation&#8208;pi interaction, leading to dynamic modulation of sodium and potassium ion currents around neurons. Additionally, released Mg2+ competes Ca2+ to inhibit its influx and neuronal excitation. In vitro cultured dorsal root neurons show a remarkable increase in threshold potential from the normal &#8722;35.9&#8197;mV to &#8722;5.9&#8197;mV after the addition of MgB2, indicating potent analgesic effect. In three typical pain models, including CFA&#8208;induced inflammatory pain, CINP&#8208; or CCI&#8208;induced neuropathic pain, MgB2 exhibits analgesic efficiency approximately 2.23, 3.20, and 2.0&#8197;times higher than clinical MgSO4, respectively, and even about 1.04, 1.66, and 1.95&#8197;times higher than morphine, respectively. The development of magnesium based intermetallic compounds holds promise in addressing the non&#8208;opioid medical need for pain relief.

         <title>Modifying Proton Relay into Bioinspired Dye&#8208;Based Coordination Polymer for Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural PCET enzymes, proton&#8208;relay containing dye&#8208;based coordination polymer, H+@In&#8722;AQ, was constructed as potent photocatalytic PCET mediator for both oxidative and reductive PCET, exhibiting the elevated reactivities and special selectivity in photocatalytic PCET&#8208;activation of inert bonds to furnish the conversions with pharmaceutical interests. @ZhangTiexin







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) imparts an energetic advantage over single electron transfer in activating inert substances. Natural PCET enzyme catalysis generally requires tripartite preorganization of proton relay, substrate&#8208;bound active center, and redox mediator, making the processes efficient and precluding side reactions. Inspired by this, a heterogeneous photocatalytic PCET system was established to achieve higher PCET driving forces by modifying proton relays into anthraquinone&#8208;based anionic coordination polymers. The proximally separated proton relays and photoredox&#8208;mediating anthraquinone moiety allowed pre&#8208;assembly of inert substrate between them, merging proton and electron into unsaturated bonds by photoreductive PCET, which enhanced reaction kinetics compared with the counter catalyst without proton relay. This photocatalytic PCET method was applied to a broad&#8208;scoped reduction of aryl ketones, unsaturated carbonyls, and aromatic compounds. The distinctive regioselectivities for the reduction of isoquinoline derivatives were found to occur on the carbon&#8208;ring sides. PCET&#8208;generated radical intermediate of quinoline could be trapped by alkene for proton relay&#8208;assisted Minisci addition, forming the pharmaceutical aza&#8208;acenaphthene scaffold within one step. When using heteroatom(X)&#8722;H/C&#8722;H compounds as proton&#8208;electron donors, this protocol could activate these inert bonds through photooxidative PCET to afford radicals and trap them by electron&#8208;deficient unsaturated compounds, furnishing the direct X&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Prenylated Macrocyclic Peptide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo discovery platform for artificial prenylated macrocycles against a target protein of choice has been developed, based on in vitro selection of a library of prenylated peptides expressed by the one&#8208;pot in vitro biosynthesis system named FIT&#8208;KgpF system. The obtained pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides showed potent inhibitory activity, improved stability, and cellular internalization, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation.







Abstract
Prenylation of peptides is widely observed in the secondary metabolites of diverse organisms, granting peptides unique chemical properties distinct from proteinogenic amino acids. Discovery of prenylated peptide agents has largely relied on isolation or genome mining of naturally occurring molecules. To devise a platform technology for de novo discovery of artificial prenylated peptides targeting a protein of choice, here we have integrated the thioether&#8208;macrocyclic peptide (teMP) library construction/selection technology, so&#8208;called RaPID (Random nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, with a Trp&#8208;C3&#8208;prenyltransferase KgpF involved in the biosynthesis of a prenylated natural product. This unique enzyme exhibited remarkably broad substrate tolerance, capable of modifying various Trp&#8208;containing teMPs to install a prenylated residue with tricyclic constrained structure. We constructed a vast library of prenylated teMPs and subjected it to in vitro selection against a phosphoglycerate mutase. This selection platform has led to the identification of a pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated teMP inhibiting the target enzyme with an IC50 of 30&#8197;nM. Importantly, the prenylation was essential for the inhibitory activity, enhanced serum stability, and cellular uptake of the peptide, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation. This work showcases the de novo discovery platform for pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides, which is readily applicable to other drug targets.

Pd on ceria, an important catalytic system for various oxidation reactions, is studied for CO oxidation in a Research Article (e202408511) by Jan&#8208;Dierk Grunwaldt et&#8197;al. The image depicts the new concept of bringing the noble metal in contact with a strongly interacting nano&#8208;island (i.e. ceria) on alumina to 1) facilitate the formation of the active clusters, 2) hinder their redispersion into single atoms, while 3) preventing strong sintering of Pd due to the spatial separation of the CeO2 islands.

         <title>Microtiter Plate Immobilization Screening for Prototyping Heterogeneous Enzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microliter plate screening method has been developed to determine the consensus immobilization protocol for the heterogenization of multi&#8208;enzymatic reaction cascades. The optimal immobilization strategy leading to the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts was determined through an activity and stability assay, as demonstrated for an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid.







Abstract
Immobilization is a key enabling technology in applied biocatalysis that facilitates the separation, recovery, and reuse of heterogeneous biocatalysts. However, finding a consensus immobilization protocol for several enzymes forming a multi&#8208;enzyme system is extremely difficult and relies on a combinatorial trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we describe a protocol in which 17 different carriers functionalized with different reactive groups are tested in a 96&#8208;well microtiter plate to screen up to 21 immobilization protocols for up to 18 enzymes. This screening includes an activity and stability assay to select the optimal immobilization chemistry to achieve the most active and stable heterogeneous biocatalysts. The information retrieved from the screening can be rationalized using a Python&#8208;based application CapiPy. Finally, through scoring the screening results, we find the consensus immobilization protocol to assemble an immobilized four&#8208;enzyme system to transform vinyl acetate into (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid. This methodology opens a path to speed up the prototyping of immobilized multi&#8208;enzyme pathways for chemical manufacturing.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel upcycling process transforms waste PET plastics, including colored, colorless, and even fabric&#8208;containing pieces, into valuable lactic acid. This sustainable and cost&#8208;effective method leverages a combination of Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling for efficient conversion and bipolar membrane electrodialysis separation for product purification. This approach offers a promising pathway for plastic waste valorization and sustainable lactic acid production, as demonstrated by Young&#8197;Kyu Hwang, Hye&#8208;Young Jang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410003).

Au&#8208;oxygen vacancy&#8208;Zr3+ complex sites proved to be efficient and selective catalytic sites for ethanol dehydrogenation by facilitating ethanol dissociation/adsorption, ethoxy activation, and product desorption.







Abstract
Developing a desirable ethanol dehydrogenation process necessitates a highly efficient and selective catalyst with low cost. Herein, we show that the &#8220;complex active site&#8221; consisting of atomically dispersed Au atoms with the neighboring oxygen vacancies (Vo) and undercoordinated cation on oxide supports can be prepared and display unique catalytic properties for ethanol dehydrogenation. The &#8220;complex active site&#8221; Au&#8722;Vo&#8722;Zr3+ on Au1/ZrO2 exhibits the highest H2 production rate, with above 37,964&#8197;mol H2 per mol Au per hour (385&#8197;g&#8201;H2&#8201;

Combining experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate the structural sensitivity of these complex sites by assessing their selectivity and activity in ethanol dehydrogenation. Our study sheds new light on the design and development of cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient catalysts for ethanol dehydrogenation. Fundamentally, atomic&#8208;level catalyst design by colocalizing catalytically active metal atoms forming a structure&#8208;sensitive &#8220;complex site&#8221;, is a crucial way to advance from heterogeneous catalysis to molecular catalysis. Our study advanced the understanding of the structure sensitivity of the active site in atomically dispersed catalysts.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast&#8208;Healing Glassy Hyperbranched Plastics Capable of Restoring 26.4&#8197;MPa Tensile Strength within One Minute at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) consists of hyperbranched acyclic heterochains and multiple hydrogen bond arrays is demonstrated. It exhibits high modulus up to 2.5&#8197;GPa, but can restore 26.4&#8197;MPa of tensile strength within 1&#8197;min at room temperature. This ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing is attribute to the high mobility of branched terminal moieties and &#8220;water bridge&#8221; effect.







Abstract
The growing concern regarding widespread plastic pollution has propelled the development of sustainable self&#8208;healing plastics. Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to fabricating self&#8208;healing plastics, achieving rapid healing at room temperature is extremely challenging. Herein, we have developed an ultra&#8208;fast&#8208;healing glassy polyurethane (UGPU) by designing a hyperbranched molecular structure with a high density of multiple hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) on compliant acyclic heterochains and introducing trace water to form water bridge across the fractured surfaces. The compliant acyclic heterochains allow the dense multiple hydrogen bonds to form a frozen network, enabling tensile strength of up to 70&#8197;MPa and storage modulus of 2.5&#8197;GPa. The hyperbranched structure can drive the reorganization of the H&#8208;bonding network through the high mobility of the branched chains and terminals, thereby leading to self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Intriguingly, the presence of trace water vapor facilitates the formation of activated layers and the rearrangement of networks across the fractured UGPU sections, thereby enabling ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;healing at room temperature. Consequently, the restored tensile strength after healing for 1 minute achieves a historic&#8208;record of 26.4&#8197;MPa. Furthermore, the high transparency (&gt;90&#8201;%) and ultra&#8208;fast healing property of UGPU make it an excellent candidate for advanced optical and structural materials.

         <title>Broad Protection against Invasive Fungal Disease from a Nanobody Targeting the Active Site of Fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;Glucanosyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanobodies show promise in treating invasive fungal diseases such as aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. By selectively targeting enzymes critical for fungal cell wall remodeling, these single&#8208;domain antibodies significantly enhanced survival rates in animal models. This approach opens up a promising new pathway for the development of antifungal therapies, potentially improving outcomes for immunocompromised patients.







Abstract
Invasive fungal disease accounts for about 3.8&#8197;million deaths annually, an unacceptable rate that urgently prompts the discovery of new knowledge&#8208;driven treatments. We report the use of camelid single&#8208;domain nanobodies (Nbs) against fungal &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucanosyltransferases (Gel) involved in &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan transglycosylation. Crystal structures of two Nbs with Gel4 from Aspergillus fumigatus revealed binding to a dissimilar CBM43 domain and a highly conserved catalytic domain across fungal species, respectively. Anti&#8208;Gel4 active site Nb3 showed significant antifungal efficacy in vitro and in vivo prophylactically and therapeutically against different A. fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates, reducing the fungal burden and disease severity, thus significantly improving immunocompromised animal survival. Notably, C. deneoformans (serotype&#8197;D) strains were more susceptible to Nb3 and genetic Gel deletion than C. neoformans (serotype A) strains, indicating a key role for &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan remodelling in C. deneoformans survival. These findings add new insight about the role of &#946;&#8208;1,3&#8208;glucan in fungal biology and demonstrate the potential of nanobodies in targeting fungal enzymes to combat invasive fungal diseases.

         <title>Introducing a &#960;&#8208;Skeleton Perpendicular to the Central Methylene Carbon in Alkanediamides: Design of Supramolecular Polymers with an Offset &#960;&#8208;Stacking Arrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers with an offset &#960;&#8208;stacked arrangement were formed by introducing a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton perpendicularly onto the central methylene carbon atom of heptanediamide derivatives. The introduction of chiral alkyl chains at both termini of the heptanediamide further enables supramolecular polymerization of a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton with offset &#960;&#8208;stacking and effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly behavior of a heptanediamide derivative that contains a four&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton on its central methylene carbon atom has been examined. This molecule, which also contains two octyl chains, gelated the nonpolar solvent methylcyclohexane through the formation of fibrous nanostructures with hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through a cooperative nucleation&#8211;elongation process. The supramolecular polymerization is accompanied by bathochromic shifts of both the absorption and fluorescence bands while maintaining a fluorescence quantum yield comparable to that of the monomeric state. Theoretical calculations provided an energetically stable structure, in which the &#960;&#8208;skeletons are stacked with an offset of more than 8.0&#8197;&#197;, replicating the experimentally observed absorption change due to exciton coupling. Moreover, a slow transition with an inversion of the chiral arrangement of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moieties was induced by replacing the octyl chains with chiral alkyl chains. Our molecular&#8208;design strategy was further applied to a five&#8208;ring fused &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which also forms an offset &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangement and exhibits more effective chiral exciton coupling in the aggregated state.

         <title>Superionic Conduction in K3SbS4 Enabled by Cl&#8208;Modified Anion Lattice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cl&#8208;modified anion lattice in K3SbS4 enhances K+ transport. The anion&#8208;diversified K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm at room temperature, with a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This achievement represents the highest reported conductivity among non&#8208;oxide&#8208;based potassium&#8208;ion conductors to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries emerge as promising alternatives to lithium batteries, leveraging their high natural abundance and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Developing potassium solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity is critical for realizing efficient potassium batteries. In this study, we present the synthesis of K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47, showcasing a room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm and a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This represents an increase of over two orders of magnitude compared to the parent compound K3SbS4, marking the highest reported ionic conductivity for non&#8208;oxide potassium SEs. Solid&#8208;state 39K magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning nuclear magnetic resonance on K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 reveals an increased population of mobile K+ ions with fast dynamics. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations further confirm a delocalized K+ density and significantly enhanced K+ diffusion. This work demonstrates diversification of the anion sublattice as an effective approach to enhance ion transport and highlights K2.98Sb0.91S3.53Cl0.47 as a promising SE for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state potassium batteries emerge as promising alternatives to lithium batteries, leveraging their high natural abundance and cost-effectiveness. Developing potassium solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room-temperature ionic conductivity is critical for realizing efficient potassium batteries. In this study, we present the synthesis of K&lt;sub&gt;2.98&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3.53&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.47&lt;/sub&gt;, showcasing a room-temperature ionic conductivity of 0.32&#8197;mS/cm and a low activation energy of 0.26&#8197;eV. This represents an increase of over two orders of magnitude compared to the parent compound K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, marking the highest reported ionic conductivity for non-oxide potassium SEs. Solid-state &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;K magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance on K&lt;sub&gt;2.98&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3.53&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.47&lt;/sub&gt; reveals an increased population of mobile K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with fast dynamics.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (XOFs) Based on N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N Bonds: Robust Organic Networks Constructed by Fragile Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks have been constructed based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The frameworks XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities and maintained their stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents as well as in aqueous environments across a wide pH range (3&#8211;12).







Abstract
Organic frameworks face a trade&#8208;off between the framework stability and the bond dynamics, which necessitates the development of innovative linkages that can generate stable frameworks without hindering efficient synthesis. Although iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (XOFs) have been developed, constructing XOFs based on bromine(I) is desirable yet challenging due to the high sensitivity of bromine(I) species. In this work, we present the inaugural construction of stable bromine(I)&#8208;bridged two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf, based on sensitive [N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N]+ halogen bonds. The formation of XOF(Br)&#8722;TPy&#8722;BF4/OTf was monitored by 1H NMR, XPS, IR, SEM, TEM, HR&#8208;TEM, SEAD. Their framework structures were established by the results from PXRD, theoretical simulations and SAXS. More importantly, XOF(Br) displayed excellent chemical and thermal stabilities. They exhibited stable two&#8208;dimensional framework structures in various organic solvents and aqueous media, even over a wide pH range (pH 3&#8211;12), while the corresponding model compounds BrPy2BF4/OTf decomposed quickly even in the presence of minimal water. Furthermore, the influence of the counterions were investigated by replacing BF4 with OTf, which improved the stability of XOF(Br). This characteristic enabled XOF(Br) to serve as an efficient oxidizing reagent in aqueous environments, in contrast with the sensitivity of BrPy2BF4/OTf, which performed well only in organic media. This study not only deepens our fundamental understanding of organic frameworks but also opens new avenues for the development and application of multifunctional XOFs.

         <title>Quantitative Kinetic Insights from Operando&#8208;UV/Vis Spectroscopy: An Application to NH3&#8722;SCR of NOx on Cu&#8208;CHA Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV/Vis spectroscopy is coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic data, simultaneously monitoring both the catalyst redox state and the gas&#8208;phase dynamics during the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx with NH3 over Cu&#8208;CHA. This work highlights the accessibility of kinetic studies directly from operando UV/Vis spectroscopy paving the way for elucidating the structure&#8211;activity relation under kinetically relevant conditions.







Abstract
We employ UV/Vis Diffuse Reflectance spectroscopy directly coupled with a packed bed flow reactor to extract quantitative kinetic information. We use as a show&#8208;case the CuII/CuI redox dynamics during the reduction half cycle of the NH3&#8208;Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) on Cu&#8208;CHA catalysts. Our measurements enable quantification of the fraction of oxidized Cu, reconstructed by Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) together with monitoring of the gas&#8208;phase evolution during the reaction. These data both on the dynamics of the gas&#8208;phase and of the active site oxidation state have been used to assess the reduction half cycle rate equation and estimate the rate constant. Our results in terms of reaction orders and kinetic constant are in line with previous findings in the literature. Overall, our results demonstrate that the combined analysis of the UV spectra and of the gas&#8208;phase dynamics provides converging and unparalleled kinetic insight: this approach effectively resolves ambiguities concerning RHC kinetics and mechanism. More in general, this work provides evidence that operando spectroscopy can be used to extract quantitative kinetic information on catalytic cycles.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation on Perovskite Quantum Dots Based on Ce&#8208;Oxygen Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ce ion doping increases the density of the lowest exciton state (X1 in CBM) of perovskite quantum dots, and Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity induces the formation of midgap states (MSs) involving oxygen. Under light excitation, the relaxation process of excitons to oxygen molecules is accelerated, resulting in the formation of a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thus drives the generation of high value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have shown attractive prospects in the field of visible photocatalysis, especially in the synthesis of high value&#8208;added chemicals. However, under aerobic conditions, the stable operation of QD catalysts has been limited by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoexcitation, especially superoxide species O2&#8901;&#8722;. Here, we propose a strategy of Ce3+ doping in perovskite QDs to guide superoxide species for photocatalytic oxidation reactions. In C(sp3)&#8722;H bond oxidation of hydrocarbons, superoxide species were rapidly generated and efficiently utilized on the surface of perovskite QDs, which achieves the stable operation of the catalytic system and obtains a high product conversion rate (15.3&#8197;mmol/g/h for benzaldehydes). The mechanism studies show that the strong Ce&#8208;oxygen affinity accelerates the relaxation process of photoinduced exciton transfer to superoxide species and inhibits the radiative recombination pathway. This work provides a new idea of utilizing oxygen species on perovskite surface and broadens the design strategy of high&#8208;performance QD photocatalysts.

         <title>A High&#8208;Mobility n&#8208;Type Noncovalently&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Polymer for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer pDFSe with noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring acceptor triad and axisymmetric donor is synthesized to show increased rigidity and reduced lamellar ordering, which can simultaneously achieve excellent electron transport (6.15&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and doping efficiency. Upon n&#8208;doping, pDFSe shows excellent thermoelectric performance with electrical conductivity of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are emerging as competitive candidates for organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, to make the device truly pervasive, both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are essential. Despite great efforts, no n&#8208;type equivalents to the p&#8208;type benchmark PEDOT:PSS exist to date mainly due to the low electrical conductivity (&#963;). Herein, a near&#8208;amorphous n&#8208;type conjugated polymer, namely pDFSe, is reported with high &#963; by achieving the synergy between charge transport and doping efficiency. The polymer pDFSe is synthesized based on an acceptor&#8208;triad moiety of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;difluorobenzoselenadiazole&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole (DFSe), which has the noncovalently&#8208;fused&#8208;ring structure to reinforce the backbone rigidity.

&lt;p&gt;An n-type conjugated polymer pDFSe with noncovalently-fused-ring acceptor triad and axisymmetric donor is synthesized to show increased rigidity and reduced lamellar ordering, which can simultaneously achieve excellent electron transport (6.15&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and doping efficiency. Upon n-doping, pDFSe shows excellent thermoelectric performance with electrical conductivity of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers are emerging as competitive candidates for organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). However, to make the device truly pervasive, both p- and n-type conjugated polymers are essential. Despite great efforts, no n-type equivalents to the p-type benchmark PEDOT:PSS exist to date mainly due to the low electrical conductivity (&#963;). Herein, a near-amorphous n-type conjugated polymer, namely pDFSe, is reported with high &#963; by achieving the synergy between charge transport and doping efficiency. The polymer pDFSe is synthesized based on an acceptor-triad moiety of diketopyrrolopyrrole-difluorobenzoselenadiazole-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DFSe), which has the noncovalently-fused-ring structure to reinforce the backbone rigidity. Furthermore, an axisymmetric thiophene-selenophene-thiophene donor is introduced, which enables the formation of near-amorphous microstructures. The above merits ensure good doping efficiency without scarifying efficient intrachain charge-carrier transport. Thus, pDFSe-based n-type transistors exhibit high electron mobility up to 6.15&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, much higher than its reference polymer pDSe without the noncovalently-fused-ring structure (0.77&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Further upon n-doping, pDFSe demonstrates excellent &#963; of 62.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maximum power factor of 133.1&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which are among the highest values reported for solution-processed n-type polymers. The results demonstrate the great potential of near-amorphous n-type conjugated polymers with noncovalently-fused-ring structure for the next-generation OTEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal and Mechanistic Diversity in Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerizations of Allene&#8208;Tethered Pyrroles and Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;allenyl pyrroles and indoles is reported. The method, which is initiated by a C&#8722;H activation step, delivers a diversity of synthetically relevant azaheterocyclic products, depending on the precise ancillary ligand used and the substitution pattern of the allene. Particularly attractive are the hydrocarbonation cascades of tetrasubstituted allenyl precursors, which involve either a concomitant hydrogenation or a cyclopropanation step, and proceed with excellent stereo and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Pyrroles and indoles bearing N&#8208;allenyl tethers participate in a variety of iridium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization processes initiated by a C&#8722;H activation step, to deliver a diversity of synthetically relevant azaheterocyclic products. By appropriate selection of the ancillary ligand and the substitution pattern of the allene, the reactions can diverge from simple intramolecular hydrocarbonations to tandem processes involving intriguing mechanistic issues. Accordingly, a wide range of heterocyclic structures ranging from dihydro&#8208;indolizines and pyridoindoles to tetrahydroindolizines, as well as cyclopropane&#8208;fused tetrahydroindolizines can be obtained. Moreover, by using chiral ligands, these cascade processes can be carried out in an enantioselective manner. DFT studies provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and justify the observed chemo&#8208; regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluorescence and SERS Dynamic&#8208;Reversible Probes for Long&#8208;Term Assessment of Osteoarthritis In Vivo</title>

         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;activated ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and SERS bimodal imaging nanoprobe based on thermosensitive pNIPAm&#8208;co&#8208;AAm&#8208;co&#8208;PAA&#8208;IR&#8208;1061 and nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures (DCNP@Si@AuNSP) was developed to realize long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in vivo. The FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature, enabling long&#8208;term and accurate monitoring of dynamic temperature variations during the onset and treatment of arthritis in rats.







Abstract
The abnormal fluctuation of temperature in vivo usually reflects the progression of inflammatory diseases. Noninvasive, real&#8208;time, and accurate monitoring and imaging of temperature variation in vivo is advantageous for guiding the early diagnosis and treatment of disease, but it remains difficult to achieve. Herein, we developed a temperature&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe for long&#8208;term monitoring of temperature changes in rat arthritis and timely assessment of the status of osteoarthritis. The thermosensitive polymer bearing NIR&#8208;II FL dye was grafted onto the surface of nanoporous core&#8208;satellite gold nanostructures to form the nanoprobe, wherein the nanoprobe contains NIR&#8208;II FL and Raman reference signals that are independent of temperature change. The ratiometric FL1150/FL1550 and S1528/S2226 values of the nanoprobe exhibited a reversible conversion with temperature changes. The nanoprobe accurately distinguishes the temperature variations in the inflamed joint versus the normal joint in vivo by ratiometric FL and SERS imaging, allowing for an accurate diagnosis of inflammation. Meanwhile, it can continuously monitor fluctuations in temperature over an extended period during the onset and treatment of inflammation. The tested temperature change trend could be used as an indicator for early diagnosis of inflammation and real&#8208;time evaluation of therapeutic effects.

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Selectivity and Osmotic Energy by Using an Ultrathin Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Membrane with Trilayered Continuous Porous Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a significantly promoted selectivity and blue energy harvesting performance by a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with a trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which is composed of an ultrathin zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 MOF and a highly aligned branched alumina nanochannel membrane.







Abstract
Designing a nanofluidic membrane with high selectivity and fast ion transport property is the key towards high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion. However, most of reported membranes can produce power density less than commercial benchmark (5&#8197;W/m2), due to the imbalance between ion selectivity and permeability. Here, we report a novel nanoarchitectured design of a heterogeneous membrane with an ultrathin and dense zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer and a highly aligned and interconnected branched alumina nanochannel membrane. The design leads to a continuous trilayered pore structure of large geometry gradient in the sequence from angstrom&#8208;scale to nano&#8208;scale to sub&#8208;microscale, which enables the enhanced directional ion transport, and the angstrom&#8208;sized (~6.6&#8211;7&#8197;&#197;) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 windows render the membrane with high ion selectivity. Consequently, the novel heterogeneous membrane can achieve a high&#8208;performance power of ~8&#8197;W/m2 by mixing synthetic seawater and river water. The power density can be largely upgraded to an ultrahigh ~17.1&#8197;W/m2 along with ~48.5&#8201;% conversion efficiency at a 50&#8208;fold KCl gradient. This work not only presents a new membrane design approach but also showcases the great potential of employing the zirconium&#8208;based MOF channels as ion&#8208;channel&#8208;mimetic membranes for highly efficient blue energy harvesting.

&lt;p&gt;The direct Ir-V bond interaction in a V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Ir catalyst (Ir-V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) induced strong electron transfer and electron donation abilities, resulting in superior electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance due to the accelerated rate-determine-step by the electrons injection from V to Ir, as described by Zhiyuan Zeng, Shuang Li, Changsheng Zhao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202406427"&gt;e202406427&lt;/a&gt;). This research provides essential insights into the regulation mechanisms of interfacial chemical bonding in electrocatalysts and offers new pathways for catalyst design.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Active Oxygenated Structure&#8208;Intensified CO2 Capture Enables Efficient Electrochemical Ethylene Production Over Carbon Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinone&#8208;grafted and Cu&#8208;confined carbon nanofibers were constructed via an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy. Such functional carbon nanofibers enhance CO2 capture followed by activation, promoting high&#8208;rate ethylene production from CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202401707), Jing He, Xu Xiang et&#8197;al. show that the intensified CO2 capture facilitates CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO conversion for adequate *CO coverage and hinderance of *H co&#8208;adsorption in nearby Cu sites, which reduces the C&#8211;C coupling energy barrier and attenuates the subsequent *CO protonation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive chiral hydrogels are fabricated from thermoresponsive helical dendronized poly(phenylacetylene)s through dynamic covalent chemistry at freezing temperature. These highly porous hydrogels possess stabilized chiralities originated from the copolymer precursors, and exhibit remarkable compressibility like human articular cartilage with full recoverability and excellent fatigue resistance, as described by Xiacong Zhang, Afang Zhang, Wen Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (url href=&#8220;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407552&#8221;&gt;e202407552).

         <title>Back Cover: Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions for their high selectivity, yet they often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. In their Research Article (e202406262), Junling Lu et&#8197;al. report that the tuning of the local electronic structures of anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping of boron atoms with low electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with remarkably improved hydrogenation activity and stability.

         <title>Front Cover Picture: A Double Twisted Nanographene with a Contorted Pyrene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist operation on nanographenes induces inherent chirality which differs from the conventional axial or helical chirality. Yoshifumi Hashikawa, Fenghua Bai, Chaolumen et&#8197;al. studied a chiral nanographene with a two&#8208;fold twisted geometry in their Research Article (e202406927). The contorted pyrene as a central core of the nanographene significantly governs overall electronic nature such as facile chemical oxidation, red emissivity, high quantum yield, and even chiroptical properties.

         <title>Fence&#8208;type Molecular Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the slow redox kinetics of sulfur species and shuttling issues of soluble intermediates induced from the multiphase sulfur redox reactions are crucial factors for developing the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, we successfully constructed a novel molecular electrocatalyst through in situ polymerization of bis(3,4&#8208;dibromobenzene)&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (BD18C6) with polysulfide anions on the cathode interface. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer acts as a spatial "fence" to precisely control the unique redox characteristics of sulfur species, which could confine sulfur substance within its interior and interact with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to optimize the reaction barrier of sulfur species. The "fence"&#160;structure and the double&#8208;sided Li+ penetrability of the CE molecule may also prevent the CE catalytic sites from being covered by sulfur during cycling. This new fence&#8208;type electrocatalyst mitigates the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, enhances the redox activity of sulfur species, and promotes the formation of three&#8208;dimensional stacked lithium sulfide (Li2S) simultaneously. It thus enables lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to exhibit superior rate performance and cycle stability, which may also inspire development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy&#8208;efficient conversion process.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate&#8208;Mediated Electroenzymatic Synthesis via Biological Cofactor NADH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic biohybrid systems by coupling artificial system with nature&#8217;s machinery may offer a disruptive solution to address the global energy crisis. We developed a versatile electroenzymatic pathway for the continuous synthesis of valuable chemicals, facilitated by formate&#8208;driven NADH regeneration. Utilising a bismuth electrocatalyst, we achieved stable CO2&#160;reduction to formate with approximately 90% Faraday efficiency at a current density of 150 mA cm&#8722;2. The generated formate acts as a mediator to regenerate NADH, which is then coupled with immobilised redox enzymes&#8212;alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and L&#8208;glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)&#8212;to produce targeted chemicals at significant rates and exceptionally high turnover numbers (1.8&#215;106 to 3.1&#215;106). These achievements not only underscore the efficiency of the system but also its practical applicability in industrial settings. By leveraging in situ generated formate, this innovative approach demonstrates the potential of integrating electrocatalysis with enzymatic reactions for sustainable and efficient chemical production on a practical scale.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Tetrahedra as Functional Nanostructures: From Basic Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled supramolecular DNA tetrahedra composed of programmed sequence&#8208;engineered complementary base&#8208;paired strands represent elusive nanostructures having key contributions to the development and diverse applications of DNA nanotechnology. By appropriate engineering of the strands, DNA tetrahedra of tuneable sizes and chemical functionalities were designed. Programmed functionalities for diverse applications were integrated into tetrahedra structures including sequence&#8208;specific recognition strands (aptamers), catalytic DNAzymes, nanoparticles, proteins, or fluorophore. The article presents a comprehensive review addressing methods to assemble and characterize the DNA tetrahedra nanostructures, and diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra framework are discussed. Topics being addressed include the application of structurally functionalized DNA tetrahedra nanostructure for the assembly of diverse optical or electrochemical sensing platforms and functionalized intracellular sensing and imaging modules. In addition, the triggered reconfiguration of DNA tetrahedra nanostructures and dynamic networks and circuits emulating biological transformations are introduced. Moreover, the functionalization of DNA tetrahedra frameworks with nanoparticles provides building units for the assembly of optical devices and for the programmed crystallization of nanoparticle superlattices. Finally, diverse applications of DNA tetrahedra in the field of nanomedicine are addressed. These include the DNA tetrahedra assisted permeation of nanocarriers into cells for imaging, controlled drug release, active chemodynamic/photodynamic treatment of target tissues, and regenerative medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals of A Three&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Covalent Framework Containing Te&#8208;O&#8208;B&#8208;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extending covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into crystalline carbon&#8208;free covalent backbones is an important strategy to endow these materials with more exotic functions. Integrating metal&#8208;free inorganic and organic components into one covalent framework is an effective way to address the issue of poor thermal/solvent stability in the field of nonlinear optics (NLO). However, constructing such structures is very challenging. Here, we linked 3&#8208;connected nods (BO3) and 2&#8208;connected organic building blocks (Te(Ph)2) together to produce colorless single crystals (size up to 400 &#181;m) of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) chiral covalent framework (CityU&#8208;22). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis reveals that CityU&#8208;22 has a non&#8208;carbon Te&#8208;O&#8208;B&#8208;O bond&#8208;based network with the srs topology. The chiral CityU&#8208;22 displays good stability under the treatment of different common solvents or heat (the decomposition temperature above 300 &#176;C). Due to its non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone (&#8208;Te&#8208;O&#8208;B&#8208;O&#8208;), CityU&#8208;22 shows an ultraviolet NLO behavior with a second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response similar to KH2PO4 (KDP).</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;surface Synthesis of Triaza[5]triangulene through Cyclodehydrogenation and its Magnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8211;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Logical Computing on a Transistor for Cancer Molecular Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the high degree of variability and complexity of cancer, precise monitoring and logical analysis of different nucleic acid markers are crucial for improving diagnostic precision and patient survival rates. However, existing molecular diagnostic methods normally suffer from high cost, cumbersome procedures, dependence on specialized equipment and the requirement of in&#8208;depth expertise in data analysis, failing to analyze multiple cancer&#8208;associated nucleic acid markers and provide immediate results in a point&#8208;of&#8208;care manner. Herein, we demonstrate a transistor&#8208;based DNA molecular computing (TDMC) platform that enables simultaneous detection and logical analysis of multiple microRNA (miRNA) markers on a single transistor. TDMC can perform not only basic logical operations such as "AND" and "OR", but also complex cascading computing, opening up new dimensions for multi&#8208;index logical analysis. Owing to the high efficiency, sensing and computations of multi&#8208;analytes can be operated on a transistor at a concentration as low as 2&#215;10&#8722;16 M, reaching the lowest concentration for DNA molecular computing. Thus, TDMC achieves an accuracy of 98.4% in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma from 62 serum samples. As a convenient and accurate platform, TDMC holds promise for applications in &#8220;one&#8208;stop&#8221; personalized medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8208;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41 &#197;) than the Mn&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49 &#197;). The modulated Ir&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O (&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2&#160;via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3&#160;exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100 A gIr&#8208;1 at 1.5 V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63 V at 1.0 A cm&#8208;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15 &#956;V h&#8208;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks&#8208;based Electrolytes with Controllable Hydrogen Bonding Networks for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and&#160;rational design of electrode/electrolyte interfaces remains challenging for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, for the first time, a high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;oxygen battery is developed based on the Li&#8208;ion&#8208;conducted hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (LHOF) electrolyte and the core&#8208;shell HOF&#8208;DAT@CNT cathode with a few layers of HOF&#8208;DAT on surface of&#160;carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from the abundant dynamic hydrogen bonding network in&#160;LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs, fast Li+ ion transport (2.2 &#215; 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1), a high Li+ transfer number (0.88), and a wide electrochemical window of 5.05 V are achieved. Symmetric batteries constructed with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs exhibit a stably cycled duration of over 1400 h, which mainly stems from the jumping sites that promote a uniformly high rate of Li+ flux and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network structure that can relieve the structural changes during Li+ transport. LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs&#8208;based Li&#8211;O2 batteries exhibit high specific capacity (10335 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling life up to 150 cycles. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs endow good rate capability (128.8 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 C), long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (210 cycles). The design of LHOF&#8208;DAT SSEs opens an avenue for the development of novel SSEs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

aminations of functionalized aryl fluorosulfates&#160;in water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8211;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with&#160;&#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and&#160;t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring&#160;the Whole Deposition Process from Hydrated Zn2+ to Zn0 for Stable and Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) indeed faces challenges primarily attributed to the inherent side reactions and dendrite growth associated with the Zn anode. In the present work, N&#8208;Methylmethanesulfonamide (NMS) is introduced to optimize the transfer, desolvation, and reduction of Zn2+, achieving highly stable and reversible Zn plating/stripping. The NMS molecule can substitute one H2O molecule in the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+ and be preferentially chemisorbed on the Zn surface to protect Zn anode against corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), thereby suppressing byproducts formation. Additionally, a robust N&#8208;rich organic and inorganic (ZnS and ZnCO3) hybrid solid electrolyte interphase is in situ generated on Zn anode due to the decomposition of NMS, resulting in enhanced Zn2+ transport kinetics and uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, aqueous cells with the NMS achieve a long lifespan of 2300 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, high cumulative plated capacity of 3.25 Ah cm&#8722;2, and excellent reversibility with an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7% over 800 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Concomitant Formation Method for Fabrication of Cu(I)&#8208;MOF/Polymer Composites with Antifouling Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Marine biofouling, which is one of the technical challenges hindering the growth of the marine economy, has been controlled using cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles due to the exceptional antifouling properties of Cu(I) ions. However, Cu2O nanoparticles have encountered bottlenecks due to explosive releases of Cu+ ions, high toxicity at elevated doses, and long&#8208;term instability. Here, we present a novel method called Redox Concomitant Formation (RCF) for fabricating a hierarchical Cu(I) metal&#8208;organic framework polypyrrole (Cu(I)&#8208;MOF/PPy) composite. This method enables in&#8208;situ phase transition via successive redox reactions that change the chemical valence state and coordination mode of Cu(II)&#8208;MOF, resulting in a new structure of Cu(I)&#8208;MOF while creating a PPy layer surrounded by the hierarchical structure. Owing to the steady release of Cu+ ions from the Cu(I) sites and photothermal properties of PPy, Cu(I)&#8208;MOF/PPy exhibits superior and broad&#8208;spectrum resistance to marine bacteria, algae, and surface&#8208;adhered biofilms in complex biological environments, as well as long&#8208;term stability, resulting in 100% eradication efficiency under solar&#8208;driven heating. Mechanistic insights into successive structural redox reactions and formation using the RCF method are provided in detail, enabling the fabrication of novel MOFs with the desired composition and structure for a wide range of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Passivation Effect for MnO2&#160;Catalysts in Li&#8208;S Batteries by Anion&#8208;Cation Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are recognized as high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst systems for restraining the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, owing to their robust adsorption capabilities for polysulfides. However, the sluggish catalytic conversion of Li2S redox and severe passivation effect of TMOs exacerbate polysulfide shuttling and reduce&#160;the cyclability of Li&#8208;S batteries, which significantly hinders the development of TMOs electrocatalysts. Here, through the anion&#8208;cation doping approach, dual incorporation of phosphorus and molybdenum into MnO2&#160;(P,Mo&#8208;MnO2) was engineered, demonstrating effective mitigation of the passivation effect and allowing for the simultaneous immobilization of polysulfides and rapid redox kinetics of Li2S.&#160;Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the pivotal role of dopants in fine&#8208;tuning the d&#8208;band center and optimizing the electronic structure of MnO2. Furthermore, this well&#8208;designed configuration processes catalytic selectivity. Specifically, P&#8208;doping expedites rapid Li2S nucleation kinetics by minimizing reaction&#8208;free energy, while Mo&#8208;doping facilitates robust Li2S dissolution kinetics by mitigating decomposition barriers.&#160;This dual&#8208;doping approach equips P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#160;with robust bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity, effectively overcoming passivation effect and suppressing the notorious shuttle effect. Consequently, Li&#8208;S batteries incorporating P,Mo&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based separators&#160;demonstrate favorable performance than&#160;pristine TMOs. This design offers rational viewpoint for the development of catalytic materials with superior bi&#8208;directional sulfur electrocatalytic in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable. Herein, we utilized MXene&#160;to&#160;improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65 mg cm&#8208;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2 mAh cm&#8208;2 (311 mAh g&#8208;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6 mAh cm&#8208;2 or 148 mAh g&#8208;1 at 120 mA cm&#8208;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2 mWh cm&#8208;2) and gravimetric energy density (465 Wh kg&#8208;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupled Dendritic Molecule Doping: General Approach to Activate Commercial Polymers into Harsh Condition&#8208; Tolerant Multi&#8208;Reusable Strong Supramolecular Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing functional&#160;adhesives combining strong adhesion, good recyclability and diverse harsh&#8208;condition adaptability is a grand challenge. Here, we introduce a general dendritic molecule doping strategy to activate commercial polymers into a new family of supramolecular adhesives integrating high adhesion strength, ultralow temperature, water resistant and multi&#8208;reusable properties. Our method involves rational design of a new rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule &#8208; M4C8OH as a versatile dopant, while simple M4C8OH doping&#160;into commercial polymers can modulate internal and external non&#8208;covalent interaction to enable H&#8208;bonding enhanced interchain cross&#8208;linking for tough cohesion along with enhanced interphase interaction. This endows 20 wt% M4C8OH&#8208;doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL&#8208;M4C8OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87 times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths&#160;of PCL&#8208;M4C8OH on polymethyl methacrylate&#160;at 25 &#176;C and &#8208;196 &#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58 MPa &#8208; 1.9 and 2.3 times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives. PCL&#8208;M4C8OH also displays markedly&#8208;improved multi&#8208;usability and tolerance against ultralow temperature and diverse wet environments. Mechanism studies reveal the crucial role of&#160; M4C8OH molecular structures toward superior adhesion. Our method can be expanded to other polymer matrices, yielding diverse new supramolecular adhesives.</dc:description>

This endows 20 wt% M4C8OH-doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL-M4C8OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87 times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths&#160;of PCL-M4C8OH on polymethyl methacrylate&#160;at 25 &#176;C and -196 &#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58 MPa - 1.9 and 2.3 times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives. PCL-M4C8OH also displays markedly-improved multi-usability and tolerance against ultralow temperature and diverse wet environments. Mechanism studies reveal the crucial role of&#160; M4C8OH molecular structures toward superior adhesion. Our method can be expanded to other polymer matrices, yielding diverse new supramolecular adhesives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Microscopically Heterogeneous Colloid Electrolyte for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Calendar&#8208;Life Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life are critical metrics in rechargeable batteries, especially in silicon&#8208;based batteries that are susceptible to sluggish Li+&#160;desolvation kinetics and HF&#8208;induced corrosion. No existing electrolyte simultaneously tackles both these pivotal challenges. Here we report a microscopically heterogeneous covalent organic nanosheet (CON) colloid electrolyte for extremely fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations and operando Raman spectroscopy reveal the fundamental mechanism of the multiscale noncovalent interaction, which involves the mesoscopic CON attenuating the microscopic Li+&#8208;solvent coordination, thereby expediting the Li+&#160;desolvation kinetics. This electrolyte design enables extremely fast&#8208;charging capabilities of the full cell, both at 8C (83.1% state of charge) and 10C (81.3% state of charge). Remarkably, the colloid electrolyte demonstrates record&#8208;breaking cycling performance at 10C (capacity retention of 92.39% after 400 cycles). Moreover, benefiting from the robust adsorption capability of mesoporous CON towards HF and water, a notable improvement is observed in the calendar life of the full cell. This study highlights the role of microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolytes in enhancing the fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life of Si&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. Our work offers fresh perspectives on electrolyte design with multiscale interactions, providing insightful guidance for the development of alkali&#8208;ion/metal batteries operating under harsh environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Enabled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers Recyclability and Material Circularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their remarkable features of lightweight, high strength, stiffness, high&#8208;temperature resistance, and corrosion resistance, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are extensively used in sports equipment, vehicles, aircraft, windmill blades, and other sectors. The urging need to develop a resource&#8208;saving and environmentally responsible society requires the recycling of CFRPs. Traditional CFRPs, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle due to the permanent covalent crosslinking of polymer matrices. The combination of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fibers (CFs) marks a new development path for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs and polymer resins. This review summarizes the most recent developments of closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs from the unique paradigm of dynamic crosslinking polymers, CANs. These sophisticated materials with diverse functions, oriented towards CFs recycling and resin sustainability, are further categorized into several active domains of dynamic covalent bonds, including ester bonds, imine bonds, disulfide bonds, boronic ester bonds, and acetal linkages, etc. Finally, the possible strategies for the future design of recyclable CFPRs by combining dynamic covalent chemistry innovation with materials interface science are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid&#8208;IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand&#8208;canonical density function theory (GC&#8208;DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O&#8208;coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O &#8594; *OOH to *OH &#8594; *O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2&#8208;based catalysts for acidic OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Ion Pairing and Transport in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Reversible Lithium Metal Anodes at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coulombic efficiency of over 99% is rarely achieved for Li metal anode below &#8208;40&#176;C, hindering the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries under extreme conditions. Herein, limiting factors for Li metal reversibility are investigated utilizing ether&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes of different solvent&#8208;diluent combinations. We find that along with the desolvation barrier, bulk ion transport properties including ionic conductivity, transference number, and diffusivity are also crucial factors for low&#8208;temperature Li deposition behavior. Superior Li metal reversibility was observed within the combination of the solvent with moderately weak solvating power and the diluent with minimal viscosity, highlighting the role of ion transport and the necessity for a trade&#8208;off with desolvation. The optimized electrolyte composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, methyl n&#8208;propyl ether, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether delivers exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.34% at &#8208;40&#176;C and 98.96% at &#8208;60&#176;C under a current density of 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, Li||LiCoO2 (2.7 mAh cm&#8208;2) cells demonstrate impressive reversible capacity and cycling stability at these temperatures. This work sheds light on the less&#8208;recognized relevance of bulk ion transport to low&#8208;temperature performance and provides guidelines for the electrolyte design of Li metal batteries operating in cold environments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multielectron and High&#8208;Potential Spirobifluorene&#8208;based Posolyte for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising energy demand driven by human activity has posed pressing challenges in embracing renewable energy, necessitating advances in energy storage technologies to maximize their utilization efficiency. Recent studies in aqueous organic redox flow batteries&#160;focused primarily on the development of organic negative electrolytes, while the progress in organic positive electrolytes remains constrained by limitations in their redox potentials and effective electron concentrations. Herein, we report a spatially twisted chlorinated spirobifluorene ammonium salts (CSFAs), created through an unexpected green chlorination&#8208;protection pathway during the initial cycling in flow battery, utilizing chloride ions from counterions in aqueous solution. The chlorinated, nonplanar spiral structure of CFSAs possesses a one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron transfer electrochemical property and offers exceptional resistance to nucleophilic attacks, exhibiting an unprecedented redox potential as high as 1.05 V (vs. SHE). A full redox flow battery based on CFSA&#8208;Cl (chloride ions as the counter ions) with 1.4 M electron concentration achieved an average coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.4% and a capacity utilization reaching 95% of the four&#8208;electron capacity for a stable cycling over 250 cycles (~22 days). The present work exemplifies the use of side reactions to develop new redox species, which can be extended to create more structurally versatile energy storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Driven Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction to C2H4 on Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Copper Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective CO2 photoreduction to value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) feedstocks, such as C2H4, holds great promise in direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. Nevertheless, the performance is largely inhibited by the high energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2+ products with low selectivity. Here we report that through facile surface immobilization of a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM&#8208;BF4) ionic liquid, plasmonic Cu nanowires could enable highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 product. At an optimal condition, the resultant plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits C2H4 production with selectivity up to 96.7% under 450 nm monochromatic light irradiation, greatly surpassing its pristine Cu counterpart. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations unravel that the addition of EMIM&#8208;BF4 ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, resulting in its enhanced adsorption strength of *CO intermediate and significantly reduced energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling process. This work paves new path for Cu surface plasmons in selective artificial photosynthesis to targeted products.</dc:description>

Here we report that through facile surface immobilization of a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4) ionic liquid, plasmonic Cu nanowires could enable highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 product. At an optimal condition, the resultant plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits C2H4 production with selectivity up to 96.7% under 450 nm monochromatic light irradiation, greatly surpassing its pristine Cu counterpart. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations unravel that the addition of EMIM-BF4 ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, resulting in its enhanced adsorption strength of *CO intermediate and significantly reduced energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling process. This work paves new path for Cu surface plasmons in selective artificial photosynthesis to targeted products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Defect Passivation and Co&#8208;catalyst Engineering Leads to Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive candidates for producing green hydrogen via photocatalytic pathway. However, the presence of abundant defects and absence of efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites on MHPs seriously limit the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency. Herein, to address this issue, we present a bi&#8208;functionalization strategy through decorating MHPs with a molecular molybdenum&#8208;sulfur&#8208;containing co&#8208;catalyst precursor. By virtue of the strong chemical interaction between lead and sulfur and the good dispersion of the molecular co&#8208;catalyst precursor in the deposition solution, a uniform and intimate decoration of the MHPs surface with lead sulfide (PbS) and amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) co&#8208;catalysts is obtained simultaneously. We show that the PbS co&#8208;catalyst can effectively passivate the Pb&#8208;related defects on the MHPs surface, thus retarding the charge recombination and promoting the charge transfer efficiency significantly. The amorphous MoSx co&#8208;catalyst further promotes the extraction of photogenerated electrons from MHPs and facilitates the HER catalysis. Consequently, drastically enhanced photocatalytic HER activities are obtained on representative MHPs through the synergistic functionalization of PbS and MoSx co&#8208;catalysts. A solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical (STC) conversion efficiency of ca. 4.63% is achieved on the bi&#8208;functionalized FAPbBr3&#8208;xIx, which is among the highest values reported for MHPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;rechargeable zinc ion batteries with high charging and discharging efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemically self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95 V within 3 hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effects of Pore Defects in &#960;&#8208;Extended Pentadecabenzo[9]helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of precise pore defects into nanocarbon structures results in the emergence of distinct physicochemical characteristics. However, there is a lack of research on non&#8208;planar chiral nanographene involving precise pore defects. Herein, we have developed two analogues to the &#960;&#8208;extended pentadecabenzo[9]helicene (EP9H) containing embedded pore defects. Each molecule, namely extended dodecabenzo[7]helicene (ED7H; 1) or extended nonabenzo[5]helicene (EN5H; 2), exhibits dual&#8208;state emission. Significantly, the value of |glum| of 1 is exceptionally high at 1.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2 in solution and BCPL as 254 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1. In PMMA film, |glum| of 1 is 8.56 &#215; 10&#8208;3, and in powder film, it is 5.00 &#215; 10&#8208;3. This study demonstrates that nanocarbon molecules with pore defects exhibit dual&#8208;state emission properties while maintaining quite good chiral luminescence properties. It was distinguished from the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect corresponding to the nanocarbon without embedded defect. Incorporating pore defects into chiral nanocarbon molecules also simplifies the synthesis process and enhances the solubility of the resulting product. These findings suggest that the introduction of pore defects can be a viable approach to improve nanocarbon molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free synthesis of heterocycles is highly sought after in the pharmaceutical industry and has garnered widespread attention due to its environmental sustainability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. We report a radical 6&#8208;endo addition method for pyridine synthesis from cyclopropylamides and alkynes under metal&#8208;free conditions. Various terminal and substituted alkynes are inserted as C2 units into cyclopropylamides to synthesize versatile pyridines with more than 51 examples. Mechanistic investigations and computational studies indicate the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig addition of vinyl radicals to the imine nitrogen atom rather than the conventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig addition to the imine carbon atom, in which the hypervalent iodine(III) plays a critical role. This reaction easily scales up with excellent functional group compatibility and suits the late&#8208;stage pyridine installation on complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9 U&#183;L&#8208;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive,&#160;and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.</dc:description>

The engineered Tb-CeMOF-X probe achieves a bursting switch-on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9 U&#183;L-1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap-type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap-type&#8221; biosensors with ultra-sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive,&#160;and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Zn2+ Migration&#8208;Diffusion Behavior by Spontaneous Cascade Optimization Strategy for Long&#8208;Life and Low N/P Ratio Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is reported firstly to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. A separation&#8208;reconstruction layer is constructed on the Zn anode. The soluble components can be separated into the electrolyte for primary optimization, and the poor&#8208;soluble components are reconstructed into flower&#8208;like arrays for secondary optimization. This strategy realizes the overall improvement of Zn ion battery performance.







Abstract
Parasitic side reactions and dendrite growth on zinc anodes are formidable issues causing limited lifetime of aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, a spontaneous cascade optimization strategy is first proposed to regulate Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior. Specifically, PAPE@Zn layer with separation&#8208;reconstruction properties is constructed in situ on Zn anode. In this layer, well&#8208;soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) can spontaneously separation to bulk electrolyte and weaken the preferential coordination between H2O and Zn2+ to achieve primary optimization. Meanwhile, poor&#8208;soluble polymerized&#8208;4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (PACMO) is reconstructed on Zn anode as hydrophobic flower&#8208;like arrays with abundant zincophilic sites, further guiding the de&#8208;solvation and homogeneous diffusion of Zn2+ to achieve the secondary optimization. Cascade optimization effectively regulates Zn2+ migration&#8208;diffusion behavior, dendrite growth and side reactions of Zn anode are negligible, and the stability is significantly improved. Consequently, symmetrical cells exhibit stability over 4000&#8197;h (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). PAPE@Zn//NH4+&#8722;V2O5 full cells with a high current density of 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 maintains 72.2&#8201;% capacity retention for 12000&#8197;cycles. Even better, the full cell demonstrates excellent performance of cumulative capacity of 2.33&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at ultra&#8208;low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 0.6 and a high mass&#8208;loading (~17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The spontaneous cascade optimization strategy provides novel path to achieve high&#8208;performance and practical ZIBs.

         <title>Structurally Modulated Formation of Cyanine J&#8208;Aggregates with Sharp and Tunable Spectra for Multiplexed Optoacoustic and Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands are attained by introducing a branched structure with a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of heptamethine cyanine dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. J&#8208;aggregates with their absorption band in NIR&#8208;II region are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging on animal models.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregation brings intriguing optical and electronic properties to molecular dyes and significantly expands their applicability across diverse domains, yet the challenge for rationally designing J&#8208;aggregating dyes persists. Herein, we developed a large number of J&#8208;aggregating dyes from scratch by progressively refining structure of a common heptamethine cyanine. J&#8208;aggregates with sharp spectral bands (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum&#8804;38&#8197;nm) are attained by introducing a branched structure featuring a benzyl and a trifluoroacetyl group at meso&#8208;position of dyes. Fine&#8208;tuning the benzyl group enables spectral regulation of J&#8208;aggregates. Analysis of single crystal data of nine dyes reveals a correlation between J&#8208;aggregation propensity and molecular arrangement within crystals. Some J&#8208;aggregates are successfully implemented in multiplexed optoacoustic and fluorescence imaging in animals. Notably, three&#8208;color multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution is achieved, owing to the sharp and distinct absorption bands of the J&#8208;aggregates.

         <title>Bis&#8208;azopyrazole Photoswitches for Efficient Solar Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles have been developed to achieve highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight. The bis&#8208;azo motif features a coupled &#960;n system, which not only red&#8208;shifts the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band into the red region, but also reverses the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. Sunlight&#8208;induced photoswitches are conducive to advancing the development of sustainable light&#8208;responsive applications and bring significant opportunities for solar energy storage and conversion.







Abstract
Although natural sunlight is one of the most abundant and sustainable energy resources, only a fraction of its energy is currently harnessed and utilized in photoactive systems. The development of molecular photoswitches that can be directly activated by sunlight is imperative for unlocking the full potential of solar energy and addressing the growing energy demands. Herein, we designed a series of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;azopyrazoles featuring a coupled &#960;n system, resulting in a pronounced redshift in their spectral absorption, reaching up to 661&#8197;nm in the red region. By varying the amino substituents of these molecules, highly efficient E&#8594;Z photoisomerization under unfiltered sunlight can be achieved, with yields of up to 88.4&#8201;%. Moreover, the Z,Z&#8208;isomers have high thermal stability with half&#8208;lives from days to years at room temperature. The introduction of ortho&#8208;amino substitutions and meta&#8208;bisazo units leads to a reversal of the n&#8211;&#960;* and &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* transitions on the energy scale. This change provides a new perspective for further tuning the visible absorption of azo&#8208;switches by utilizing the &#960;n&#8211;&#960;* band instead of the conventional n&#8211;&#960;* band. These results suggest that photoresponsive systems can be powered by sunlight instead of traditional artificial lights, thereby paving the way for sustainable smart materials and devices.

         <title>Regulating the Solvation Structure in Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the relationship between solvation structure and ion transportation and interphase chemistry in polymer electrolytes. By combining strong Li+&#8208;ether interactions and weak Li+&#8208;ester interactions with steric hindrance, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+). The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure makes it be compatible with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode with middle&#8208;high areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Our work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising electrolytes for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. However, traditional ether&#8208;based polymer electrolytes are limited by their low lithium&#8208;ion conductivity and narrow electrochemical window because of the well&#8208;defined and intimated Li+&#8208;oxygen binding topologies in the solvation structure. Herein, we proposed a new strategy to reduce the Li+&#8208;polymer interaction and strengthen the anion&#8208;polymer interaction by combining strong Li+&#8208;O (ether) interactions, weak Li+&#8208;O (ester) interactions with steric hindrance in polymer electrolytes. In this way, a polymer electrolyte with a high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and anion&#8208;rich solvation structure is obtained. This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 full cells with middle&#8208;high active material areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle at 4.5&#8197;V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion&#8208;dipole interactions.

In this way, a polymer electrolyte with a high lithium ion transference number (0.80) and anion-rich solvation structure is obtained. This polymer electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and compatibility with both Li metal anode and high-voltage NCM cathode. Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cells with middle-high active material areal loading (~7.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) can stably cycle at 4.5&#8197;V. This work provides new insight into the design of polymer electrolytes for high-energy-density lithium metal batteries through the regulation of ion-dipole interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacially Ordered NiCoMoS Nanosheets Arrays on Hierarchical Ti3C2Tx MXene for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber&#8208;Shaped Supercapacitors with Accelerated Pseudocapacitive Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design high&#8208;performance core&#8211;shell NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Due to the fiber with fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8722; adsorption barrier, stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide, and large Faradaic capacitive energy&#8208;storage, the FSCs exhibit high capacitance, energy density, cycling stability, which power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.







Abstract
Balancing electrochemical activity and structural reversibility of fibrous electrodes with accelerated Faradaic charge transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive storage are highly crucial for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Herein, we report novel core&#8211;shell hierarchical fibers for high&#8208;performance FSCs, in which the ordered NiCoMoS nanosheets arrays are chemically anchored on Ti3C2Tx fibers. Beneficial from architecting stable polymetallic sulfide arrays and conductive networks, the NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber maintains fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8722; adsorption barrier, and stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide. Consequently, the NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits a large volumetric capacitance (2472.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and reversible cycling performance (20,000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the solid&#8208;state symmetric FSCs deliver a high energy density of 50.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and bending stability, which can significantly power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.

         <title>Molecule Engineering of Sugar Derivatives as Electrolyte Additives for Deep&#8208;Reversible Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule additives with &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane, which effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes (002) facets&#8208;oriented deposition, enhancing reversibility at a high 92&#8201;% depth of discharge and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;%, resulting in low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.3 in full aqueous batteries.







Abstract
The cycling performance of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is greatly affected by dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anode, particularly in scenarios involving high depth of discharge (DOD) and low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratios in full cells. Herein, drawing upon principles of host&#8211;guest interaction chemistry, we investigate the impact of molecular structure of electrolyte additives, specifically the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups, on the zinc negative electrode through molecular design. Our findings reveal that molecules containing these groups exhibit strong adsorption onto zinc anode surfaces and chelate with Zn2+, forming a H2O&#8208;poor inner Helmholtz plane. This effectively suppresses side reactions and promotes dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition of exposed (002) facets, enhancing stability and reversibility of an average coulombic efficiency of 99.89&#8201;% with the introduction of Lactobionic acid (LA) additive. Under harsh conditions of 92&#8201;% DOD, Zn//Zn cells exhibit stable cycling at challenging current densities of 15&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Even at a low N/P ratio of 1.3, Zn//NH4V4O10 full cells with LA electrolyte exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention of 73&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles, significantly surpassing that of the blank electrolyte. Moreover, in a conversion type Zn//Br static battery with a high areal capacity (~5&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2), LA electrolyte sustains an improved cycling stability of 700&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Intrinsically Decoupled Coordination Chemistries Enable Quasi&#8208;Eutectic Electrolytes with Fast Kinetics toward Enhanced Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal theory of intrinsically decoupling is proposed to conquer the sluggish kinetics in eutectic electrolytes, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte that enables ZICs with high reversibility and elevated capacitance output.







Abstract
Eutectic electrolytes show potential beyond conventional low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) in zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) yet suffer from high viscosity and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we originally propose a universal theory of intrinsically decoupling to address these issues, producing a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;quasi&#8208;eutectic&#8221; electrolyte (quasi&#8208;EE). Joint experimental and theoretical analyses confirm its unique solution coordination structure doped with near&#8208;LCE domains. This enables the quasi&#8208;EE well inherit the advanced properties at deep&#8208;eutectic states while provide facilitated kinetics as well as lower energy barriers via a vehicle/hopping&#8208;hybridized charge transfer mechanism. Consequently, a homogeneous electroplating pattern with much enhanced Sand's time is achieved on the Zn surface, followed by a twofold prolonged service&#8208;life with drastically reduced concentration polarization. More encouragingly, the quasi&#8208;EE also delivers increased capacitance output in ZICs, which is elevated by 12.4&#8201;%&#8211;144.6&#8201;% compared to that before decoupling. Furthermore, the pouch cell with a cathodic mass loading of 36.6&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 maintains competitive cycling performances over 600&#8197;cycles, far exceeding other Zn&#8208;based counterparts. This work offers fresh insights into eutectic decoupling and beyond.

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Directional Growth and Density Modulation of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic adsorption synergistically modulates the density of CeO2&#8722;X particles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) ultimately enabling directional growth and localized density modulation of single&#8208;atom platinum (PtSA). Localized density control of PtSA via tuning the density of H* radicals can improve the electrocatalytic performance of all pH conditions in hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Dispersion of single atoms (SAs) in the host is important for optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to tune oxygen vacancies in CeO2&#8722;X directionally anchoring the single atom platinum (PtSA), which is uniformly dispersed on the rGO. The catalyst's performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be enhanced by controlling different densities of CeO2&#8208;X in rGO. The PtSA performs best optimally densified and loaded on homogeneous and moderately densified CeO2&#8208;X/rGO (PtSA&#8722;M&#8722;CeO2&#8722;X/rGO). It exhibited higher activity in HER with an overpotential of 25&#8197;mV at 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 33&#8197;mV at 1 KOH than that of almost reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, it exhibited stability for 90&#8197;hours at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1 KOH and &#8722;150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 conditions, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the suitable dispersion density of PtSA on the defects of CeO2&#8722;X with more active sites gives the potential for practical applications. This research paves the way for developing single&#8208;atom catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and stability, holding promise in advanced green energy conversion through defects engineering.

         <title>Reversible Modulation of Plasmonic Coupling of Gold Nanoparticles Confined within Swellable Polymer Colloidal Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling is achieved using gold nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres. The swelling and deswelling of these polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes enable the assembly and disassembly of the gold nanoparticles, altering their plasmonic coupling and allowing reversible color switching.







Abstract
Dynamic optical modulation in response to stimuli provides exciting opportunities for designing novel sensing, actuating, and authentication devices. Here, we demonstrate that the reversible swelling and deswelling of crosslinked polymer colloidal spheres in response to pH and temperature changes can be utilized to drive the assembly and disassembly of the embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), inducing their plasmonic coupling and decoupling and, correspondingly, color changes. The multi&#8208;responsive colloids are created by depositing a monolayer of AuNPs on the surface of resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde (RF) nanospheres, then overcoating them with an additional RF layer, followed by a seeded growth process to enlarge the AuNPs and reduce their interparticle separation to induce significant plasmonic coupling. This configuration facilitates dynamic modulation of plasmonic coupling through the reversible swelling/deswelling of the polymer spheres in response to pH and temperature changes. The rapid and repeatable transitions between coupled and decoupled plasmonic states of AuNPs enable reversible color switching when the polymer spheres are in colloidal form or embedded in hydrogel substrates. Furthermore, leveraging the photothermal effect and stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic coupling of the embedded AuNPs enables the construction of hybrid hydrogel films featuring switchable anticounterfeiting patterns, showcasing the versatility and potential of this multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive plasmonic system.

         <title>Pattern&#8208;Matched Polymer Ligands Toward Near&#8208;Perfect Synergistic Passivation for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Br/Cl Mixed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208;functional group spacing of polymer ligands is crucial for enhancing their interaction and passivation effects with perovskite nanocrystals. In this study, we demonstrate that alternating copolymers with a inter&#8208;functional group spacing of four carbon atoms exhibit nearly perfect matching with the ion distribution on the surface of CsPbBrxCl3&#8208;x, resulting in excellent performance and prolonged lifetime of pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emmiting diodes.







Abstract
Mixed Br/Cl perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) exhibit bright pure&#8208;blue emission benefiting for fulfilling the Rec. 2100 standard. However, phase segregation remains a significant challenge that severely affects the stability and emission spectrum of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we demonstrate the optimization of the spacing between polydentate functional groups of polymer ligands to match the surface pattern of CsPbBr1.8Cl1.2 PeNCs, resulting in effective synergistic passivation effect and significant improvements in PeLED performances. The block and alternating copolymers with different inter&#8208;functional group spacing are facilely synthesized as ligands for PeNCs. Surprisingly, block copolymers with a higher functional group density do not match PeNCs, while alternating copolymers enable efficient PeNCs with the high photoluminescence intensity, low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate and high exciton binding energy. Density functional theory calculations clearly confirm the almost perfect match between alternating copolymers and PeNCs. Finally, pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are achieved with the emission at 467&#8197;nm and Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.131, 0.071), high external quantum efficiency (9.1&#8201;%) and record spectral and operational stabilities (~80&#8197;mins) in mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs. Overall, this study contributes to designing the polymer ligands and promoting the development of high&#8208;performance and stable pure&#8208;color PeLEDs towards display applications.

         <title>Poly(Dibenzothiophene&#8208;Terphenyl Piperidinium) for High&#8208;Performance Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the introduction of dibenzothiophene into poly(aryl piperidinium) membrane, the sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks can efficiently transport the OH&#8722; ions through continuous OH&#8722; ions conducting highways, leading to significant improvement of anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
The anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is widely regarded as the next&#8208;generation technology for producing green hydrogen. The OH&#8722; conductivity of the anion exchange membrane plays a key role in the practical implementation of this device. Here, we present a series of Z&#8722;S&#8208;x membranes with dibenzothiophene groups. These membranes contain sulfur&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond networks that link surrounding surface site hopping regions, forming continuous OH&#8722; conducting highways. Z&#8722;S&#8208;20 has a high through&#8208;plane OH&#8722; conductivity of 182&#177;28&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and ultralong stability of 2650&#8197;h in KOH solution at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Based on rational design, we achieved a high PGM&#8208;free alkaline water electrolysis performance of 7.12&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#8197;V in a flow cell and demonstrated durability of 650&#8197;h at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C with a cell voltage increase of 0.65&#8197;mV/h.

         <title>Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid&#8208;State Lithiation Process for High&#8208;Quality Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We clarified the relationship between precursor morphology and structural evolution of ultrahigh nickel layered cathode during solid&#8208;state lithiation. Spheroidization of precursors avoids the inhomogeneous distribution of LiOH and inhibits the preferential lithiation on particle surface, which can fundamentally solve the inhomogeneous phase transition of cathodes material. This strategy improves the cycling stability of the cathode material.







Abstract
Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid&#8208;state lithiation process. By in&#8208;depth investigation into the solid&#8208;state lithiation process of LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense 

R3-m

 shell during the early stage of lithiation process.

     alt="Spheroidization: The Impact of Precursor Morphology on Solid-State Lithiation Process for High-Quality Ultrahigh-Nickel Oxide Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We clarified the relationship between precursor morphology and structural evolution of ultrahigh nickel layered cathode during solid-state lithiation. Spheroidization of precursors avoids the inhomogeneous distribution of LiOH and inhibits the preferential lithiation on particle surface, which can fundamentally solve the inhomogeneous phase transition of cathodes material. This strategy improves the cycling stability of the cathode material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered oxides with ultrahigh nickel content are considered promising high energy cathode materials. However, their cycle stability is constrained by a series of heterogeneous structural transformations during the complex solid-state lithiation process. By in-depth investigation into the solid-state lithiation process of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is found that the protruded parts on the surface of precursor particles tend to be surrounded by locally excessive LiOH, which promotes the formation of a rigid and dense

 shell during the early stage of lithiation process. The shell will hinder the diffusion of lithium and topotactic lithiation within the particles, culminating in spatially heterogeneous intermediates that can impair the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. The spheroidization of the precursor can enhance uniformity in structural evolution during solid-phase lithiation. Ultrahigh nickel cathodes derived from spherical precursors demonstrate high initial discharge specific capacity (234.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the range of 2.7&#8211;4.3&#8197;V) and capacity retention (89.3&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles), significantly superior to the non-spherical samples.

         <title>Kinetics of Strand Displacement Reaction with Acyclic Artificial Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetics of strand displacement by acyclic artificial nucleic acids were systematically investigated. Effects of toehold length, temperature, orthogonality, and heterochirality were determined. These data will allow rational design of novel nanotechnology devices based on artificial nucleic acids.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction, one of the DNA nanotechnologies, has great potential as s biological programmable platform in the cellular environment. Various artificial nucleic acids have been developed to improve stability and affinity for biological applications. However, the lack of understanding of the kinetics of TMSD reaction among artificial nucleic acids has limited their applications. We herein systematically characterized the kinetics of TMSD reactions with acyclic xeno nucleic acids (XNAs): serinol nucleic acid (SNA), acyclic D&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (D&#8208;aTNA), and acyclic L&#8208;threoninol nucleic acid (L&#8208;aTNA). We found that the strand displacement reactions by D&#8208;aTNA and by L&#8208;aTNA were highly dependent on temperature. D&#8208;aTNA and L&#8208;aTNA systems were orthogonal to each other, and chirality of the input can be switched by using SNA as an interface. We also applied TMSD reactions of XNAs to a seesaw gate amplification system which utilizes the orthogonality. This work will contribute to the developments of thermoresponsive and bioorthogonal nucleic acid circuits.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of a Mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer Carbodicarbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand was synthesized through reaction of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. Subsequent transmetallations allow ligand transfer to different metal complexes, including RhCl(CO)2 (see graphic).







Abstract
Carbodicarbenes are strong C&#8208;donor ligands, which have found numerous applications in organometallic and main group element chemistry. Herein, we report a structurally distinct carbodicarbene ligand, which is formed by dinitrogenative coupling of a Fischer carbene complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin. The resulting carbonyl complex serves as a stable source for the mixed Arduengo&#8208;Fischer carbodicarbene ligand. Facile ligand transfer reactions were demonstrated to occur with gold(I), copper(I), palladium(II), and rhodium(I) complexes.

         <title>Versatile Dehydration&#8208;Assisted Functionalization of Quantum Dots and Rods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs) with ligands is essential for their further practical application across various domains. Dehydration&#8208;assisted functionalization (DAF) is a versatile method applicable to a wide range of hydrophilic ligands with an affinity to the surface of QDs and QRs. This approach facilitates rapid one&#8208;pot ligand exchange and dense modification by efficiently transferring these ligands onto the surface of QDs and QRs. This study demonstrates the efficacy of DAF in preparing chiral QRs, engineering the surface charge of QDs, utilizing QR aggregates, and conjugating dense DNA onto cadmium&#8208;free InP/ZnS QDs. DAF therefore offers a versatile solution for hydrophilic ligand functionalization of QDs and QRs applicable to diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonalternant B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Containing Azepines: Programmable Synthesis, Responsive Chiroptical Properties and Spontaneous Resolution into a Single&#8208;Handed Helix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (NGs) constitute an important and appealing class of intrinsically chiral materials. In this work, a series of B,N&#8208;embedded helical NGs bearing azepines&#160;was synthesized via stepwise regioselective cyclodehydrogenation. First, the phenyl&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;bridged dimers were efficiently clipped into highly congested model compounds&#160;1 and 2.&#160;Later, the controllable Scholl reactions of the tetraphenyl&#8208;tethered precursor generated 1, 7 or 8 new C&#8210;C bonds, thereby establishing a robust method for the preparation of nonalternant BN&#8208;HNGs with up to 31 fused rings. The helical bilayer nature was unambiguously verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The helical chirality was transferred to the stereogenic boron centers upon fluoride coordination, with a concave&#8208;concave structure to comply with the bilayer skeleton. Notably, the largest nonalternant BN&#8208;HNG (6) spontaneously resolved into a homochiral 41 helix structure as a molecular spiral staircase during crystallization via conglomerate formation at the single&#8208;crystal scale. The large twisted C2&#8208;symmetric pi&#8208;surface and the dynamic chiral skeleton induced by curved azepines might have synergistic effects on self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers of 6 to achieve the intriguing spontaneous resolution behavior. The chiroptical properties of the enantiomer&#160;of 6 were further investigated, revealing that 6 had a strong chiroptical response in the visible range (400&#8211;700 nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, leads to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8208;activity mechanisms.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine-induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology-based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor-binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer-ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, leads to higher production of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions.

         <title>Dynamically Cross&#8208;linked Oligo[2]rotaxane Networks Mediated by Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyrotaxanes (PRs) have attracted significant research attention due to their unique topological structures and high degrees of conformational freedom. Herein, we take advantage of an oligo[2]rotaxane to &#160;construct a novel class of dynamically cross&#8208;linked rotaxane network (DCRN) mediated by metal&#8208;coordination. The oligo[2]rotaxane skeleton offers several distinct advantages: In addition to retaining the merits of traditional polymer backbones, the ordered intramolecular motion of the [2]rotaxane motifs introduced dangling chains into the network, thereby enhancing the stretchability of the DCRN. Additionally, the dissociation of host&#8210;guest recognition and subsequent sliding motion, along with the breakage of metal&#8208;coordination interactions, represented an integrated energy dissipation pathway to enhance mechanical properties. Moreover, the resulting DCRN demonstrated responsiveness to multiple stimuli and displayed exceptional self&#8208;healing capabilities in a gel state. Upon exposure to PPh3, which induced network deconstruction by breaking the coordinated cross&#8208;linking points, the oligo[2]rotaxane could be recovered, showcasing good recyclability. These findings demonstrate the untapped potential of the oligo[2]rotaxane as a polymer skeleton to develop DCRN and open the door to extend their advanced applications in intelligent mechanically interlocked materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelator&#8208;Assisted Precipitation&#8208;Based Separation of the Rare Earth Elements Neodymium and Dysprosium from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rare earth elements (REEs) are critical resources for many clean energy technologies, but are difficult to obtain in their elementally pure forms because of their nearly identical chemical properties. Here, an analogue of macropa, G&#8208;macropa, was synthesized and employed for an aqueous precipitation&#8208;based separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+. G&#8208;macropa maintains the same thermodynamic preference for the large REEs as macropa, but shows smaller thermodynamic stability constants. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the binding affinity differences of these chelators for Nd3+ and Dy3+ is a consequence of the presence or absence of an inner&#8208;sphere water molecule, which alters the donor strength of the macrocyclic ethers. Leveraging the small REE affinity of G&#8208;macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd3+, Dy3+, and G&#8208;macropa, the addition of HCO3&#8211; selectively precipitates Dy2(CO3)3, leaving the Nd3+&#8211;G&#8208;macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50:50 and 75:25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd3+:Dy3+ ratios of 95:5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G&#8208;macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in developing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513 nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34 nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520 nm, Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2% and 32.6%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Vaporchromic Domino Transformation and Polarized Photonic Heterojunctions of Organoplatinum Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photonic heterostructures with codable properties have shown great values as versatile information carriers at the micro and nanoscale. These heterostructures are typically prepared by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step growth or post&#8208;functionalization method to achieve varied emission colors among different building blocks. In order to realize high&#8208;throughput and multivariate information loading, we report here a strategy to integrate polarization signals into photonic heterojunctions. A U&#8208;shaped di&#8208;Pt(II) complex is assembled into highly&#8208;polarized yellow&#8208;phosphorescent crystalline microrods (Y&#8208;rod) by strong intermolecular Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interaction. Upon end&#8208;initiated desorption of the incorporated CH2Cl2 solvents, Y&#8208;rod is transformed in a domino fashion into tri&#8208;block polarized photonic heterojunctions (PPHs) with alternate red&#8208;yellow&#8208;red emissions or red&#8208;phosphorescent microrods (R&#8208;rod). The red emissions of these structures are also highly polarized; however, their polarization directions are just orthogonal to those of the yellow phosphorescence of Y&#8208;rod. With the aid of a patterned mask, R&#8208;rod is further programmed into multi&#8208;block PPHs with precisely&#8208;controlled block sizes by side&#8208;allowed adsorption of CH2Cl2 vapor. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations suggest that the solvent&#8208;regulated modulation of intramolecular and intermolecular excited states is critical for the construction of these PPHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Interception and Synthetic Application of Diradical and Diene Forms of Dual&#8208;Nature Azabicyclic o&#8208;Quinodimethanes Generated by 6p&#8208;Azaelectrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that 2&#8208;alkenylarylaldimines and ketimines undergo thermal 6p&#8208;azaelectrocyclization to generate a wide range of azabicyclic o&#8208;quinodimethanes (o&#8208;QDMs). These o&#8208;QDMs exist as a hybrid of a diene and a benzylic diradical. The diradical nature was confirmed by their ability to undergo dimerization and react with H&#8208;atom donor, 2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and O2. In addition, the interception of the diradicaloid o&#8208;QDMs by H&#8208;atom transfer was used to synthesize five tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids and related bioactive molecules. The diene form can undergo [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with different dienophiles to generate bridged azabicycles in high endo:exo selectivity. The azabicyclic o&#8208;QDMs can be generated for [4 + 2] cycloaddition from a wide range of electronically and sterically varied 2&#8208;alkenylarylimines, including mono, di, tri and tetrasubstituted alkenes, and imines derived from arylamine, alkylamine (1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;), benzylamine, benzylsulfonamide and Boc&#8208;amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well&#8208;defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.</dc:description>

Topology-directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene-porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5-nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti-AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields.

         <title>Enzymes in Synergy: Bacteria Specific Molecular Probe for Locoregional Imaging of Urinary Tract Infection in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared uropathogenic E. coli (UPECs) peptide fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs via the collaborative response of bacterial enzymes (OmpT and APN), enabling locoregional imaging of urinary tract infections both in vitro and in vivo, opening new avenues for timely and precise UTI diagnosis.







Abstract
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPECs) is a leading cause for urinary tract infections (UTI), accounting for 70&#8211;90&#8201;% of community or hospital&#8208;acquired bacterial infections owing to high recurrence, imprecision in diagnosis and management, and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Current methods for clinical UPECs detection still rely on labor&#8208;intensive urine cultures that impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely UTI therapeutic management. Herein, we developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UPECs fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs through its collaborative response to bacterial enzymes, enabling locoregional imaging of UTIs both in vitro and in vivo. Our NO&#8722;AH probe incorporates a dual protease activatable moiety, which first reacts with OmpT, an endopeptidase abundantly present on the outer membrane of UPECs, releasing an intermediate amino acid residue conjugated with a NIR hemicyanine fluorophore. Such liberated fragment would be subsequently recognized by aminopeptidase (APN) within the periplasm of UPECs, activating localized fluorescence for precise imaging of UTIs in complex living environments. The peculiar specificity and selectivity of NO&#8722;AH, facilitated by the collaborative action of bacterial enzymes, features a timely and accurate identification of UPECs&#8208;infected UTIs, which could overcome misdiagnosis in conventional urine tests, thus opening new avenues towards reliable UTI diagnosis and personalized antimicrobial therapy management.

         <title>Tailoring d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization to Decipher the Essential Effects of Heteroatom Substitution on Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The moderate&#8208;concentration Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 simultaneously with suitable Se vacancies adsorbing OH&#8722; (Co(M)&#8722;Ni3Se4(VM)&#8722;OH&#8722;) presents optimal d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, substantially deciphering the effects of Co atoms substitution on the fast redox kinetics and ultrahigh rate capability of Ni3Se4 cathodes.







Abstract
The heteroatom substitution is considered as a promising strategy for boosting the redox kinetics of transition metal compounds in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) although the dissimilar metal identification and essential mechanism that dominate the kinetics remain unclear. It is presented that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal and electrolyte ions can be utilized as a descriptor for understanding the redox kinetics. Herein, a series of Co, Fe and Cu heteroatoms are respectively introduced into Ni3Se4 cathodes, among them, only the moderate Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 can hold the optimal d&#8208;p orbital hybridization resulted from the formed more unoccupied antibonding states &#960;*. It inevitably enhances the interfacial charge transfer and ensures the balanced OH&#8722; adsorption&#8208;desorption to accelerate the redox kinetics validated by the lowest reaction barrier (0.59&#8197;eV, matching well with the theoretical calculations). Coupling with the lower OH&#8722; diffusion energy barrier, the prepared cathode delivers ultrahigh rate capability (~68.7&#8201;% capacity retention even the current density increases by 200&#8197;times), and an assembled HSC also presents high energy/power density. This work establishes the principles for determining heteroatoms and deciphers the underlying effects of the heteroatom substitution on improving redox kinetics and the rate performance of battery&#8208;type electrodes from a novel perspective of orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Green Solvent &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) Facilitates Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvents can significantly influence chemical reactions in condensed phases. Their critical properties are increasingly recognized in various research domains such as organic synthesis and biomass valorization. However, in semiconductor photocatalysis, solvents are primarily viewed as mediums for dissolving and diffusing substances, with their potential beneficial effects on photocatalytic conversions often overlooked. Additionally, common photocatalysis solvents like acetonitrile (ACN) pose serious safety and environmental concerns. In this study, we demonstrate that novel and safe green solvents, such as &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL), can significantly enhance the performance of semiconductor photocatalysis for C&#8722;H bond activation. Non&#8208;specific solvent&#8208;solute interactions are the primary contributors to increased photocatalytic activity in the self&#8208;coupling of benzylic compounds. Specifically, GVL's large dielectric constant and high refractive index lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining C&#8722;H bond activation step, facilitating a faster coupling reaction. The versatility of GVL is further demonstrated in reactions with multiple reagents and in various oxidation and reduction photocatalytic systems beyond classic C&#8722;H bond activation. This work not only pioneers the use of green solvents but also provides comprehensive insights for proper solvent selection in semiconductor photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

Coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels enable fast two&#8208;photon subtractive 3D microprinting and laser&#8208;guided cell outgrowth on demand, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;applications, such as spatiotemporal tissue engineering.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controlled two&#8208;photon photodegradation of hydrogels has gained increasing attention for high&#8208;precision subtractive tissue engineering. However, conventional photolabile hydrogels often have poor efficiency upon two&#8208;photon excitation in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and thus require high laser dosage that may compromise cell activity. As a result, high&#8208;speed two&#8208;photon hydrogel erosion in the presence of cells remains challenging. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of efficient coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels to overcome these limitations. A set of photolabile coumarin&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol linkers are synthesized through a Passerini multicomponent reaction. After mixing these linkers with thiolated hyaluronic acid, semi&#8208;synthetic photodegradable hydrogels are formed in situ via Michael addition crosslinking. The efficiency of photodegradation in these hydrogels is significantly higher than that in nitrobenzyl counterparts upon two&#8208;photon irradiation at 780&#8197;nm. A complex microfluidic network mimicking the bone microarchitecture is successfully fabricated in preformed coumarin hydrogels at high speeds of up to 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low laser dosage down to 10&#8197;mW. Further, we demonstrate fast two&#8208;photon printing of hollow microchannels inside a hydrogel to spatiotemporally direct cell migration in 3D. Collectively, these hydrogels may open new avenues for fast laser&#8208;guided tissue fabrication at high spatial resolution.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite impressive advances in the construction of enantioenriched silacarbocycles featuring silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers via a selection of well&#8208;defined sila&#8208;synthons, the development of a more convenient and economic method with readily available starting materials is significantly less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first example of copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation of readily accessible methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) and primary silanes, affording an efficient and convenient route to a wide range of chiral silacyclopentanes bearing consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &#8805;98% ee, &gt; 25:1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions combine copper&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant Z/E mixture of homoallylic silanes.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Anions&#8208;in&#8208;Colloid&#8221; Hydrated Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn metal suffers from severe zinc dendrites, anion&#8208;related side reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and narrow electrochemical stable window (ESW). Herein, an&#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte (ACDE&#8208;3) is designed to improve the stability of zinc anode. The ACDE&#8208;3 reconfigures the hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network and regulates the solvation shell. More importantly, the hydroxyl&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;&#8208;CDs) in ACDE&#8208;3 self&#8208;assemble into micelles, in which the steric effect between&#160;the adjacent&#160;&#946;&#8208;CDs&#160;restricts the movement of anions. This unique &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; structure enables the eutectic system with a high Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+) of 0.84.&#160; Thus, ACDE&#8208;3 inhibits the formation of dendrite, prevents the anion&#8208;involved side reactions, suppresses the HER, and enlarges the ESW to 2.32 V. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell delivers a long lifespan of 900 hours at 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the Zn//Cu half cells have a high average columbic efficiency (ACE) of 97.9% at 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2&#160;with a uniform and compact zinc deposition. When matched with a poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine) cathode, the full battery with a low negative/positive capacity&#160;ratio of 2 can still cycle steadily for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8211;1. Additionally, this electrolyte can operative over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 &#176;C to 40 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Lithium Oxygen Batteries Enabled by Solvent&#8208;diluent Interaction in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the pursuit of next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;O2 batteries, it is imperative to develop an electrolyte with stability against the strong oxidation environments. N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) is a recognized solvent known for its robust resistance to the highly reactive reduced oxygen species, yet its application in Li&#8211;O2 batteries has been constrained due to its poor compatibility with the Li metal anode. In this study, a rationally selected hydrofluoroether diluent, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether (M3), has been introduced into the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte to construct a localized high concentration electrolyte. The stable &#8211;CH3 and C&#8211;F bonds within the M3 structure could not only augment the fundamental properties of the electrolyte but also fortify its resilience against attacks from O2&#8211; and 1O2. Additionally, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8211;F) presented in the M3 diluent could facilitate coordination with the electron&#8208;donating groups (&#8211;CH3) in the DMA solvent. This intermolecular interaction promotes more alignment of Li+&#8208;anions with a small amount of M3 addition, leading to the construction of an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI that enhances the stability of the Li anode. As a result, the Li&#8211;O2 batteries with the DMA/M3 electrolyte exhibit superior cycling performance at both 30 &#176;C (359th) and &#8211;10 &#176;C (120th).</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8208;H and O&#8208;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8208;H and O&#8208;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Multisite Functionalization of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes by Merging Polar Cycloaddition and Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although highly appealing for rapid access of molecular complexity, multi&#8208;functionalization of alkenes that allows incorporation of more than two functional groups remains a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy that merges dipolar cycloaddition with photoredox promoted radical ring&#8208;opening remote C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization, thus enabling a smooth 1,2,5&#8208;trifunctionalization of unactivated alkenes. A highly regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition anchors a reaction trigger onto alkene substrates. The subsequent halogen atom transfer (XAT) selectively initiates ring&#8208;opening process, which is followed by a series of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (1,5&#8208;HAT) and intermolecular fluorine atom transfer (FAT) events. With this method, site&#8208;selective introduction of three different functional groups is accomplished and a broad spectrum of valuable &#946;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#949;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;nitrile products are synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While the supramolecular chemistry of simple anions is ubiquitous, the targeting and exploitation of their metal&#8208;containing relatives, the metalates, is less well understood. This mini review highlights the latest advances in this emergent area by discussing the supramolecular chemistry of metalates thematically, with a focus on the exploitation of metalates in a diversity of applications, including medical imaging and therapy, environmental remediation, molecular magnetism, catalysis, perovskite materials, and metal separations. The unifying features of these systems are identified with a view to allow the supramolecular chemist to target the unique material properties of the metalates, even in areas that are currently relatively immature.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum in Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Aluminum! The field of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) gained increased interest over the past 18&#8197;years. The majority of FLP systems consist of boron Lewis acids. This review highlights the developments in the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic application of intermolecular, intramolecular and hidden aluminum FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases.







Abstract
This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14&#8197;years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so&#8208;called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non&#8208;polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert&#8208;butyl ethylene and imines, C&#8722;F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.

         <title>Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling to Access C(sp3)&#8208;Rich gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild and highly selective decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling diborylmethylation of various alkyl carboxylic acids with a gem&#8208;diboryl metallic reagent has been accomplished via dual photoredox/copper catalysis providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176;&#8201;&#946; positions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes are highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry due to their ability to participate in multi&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling transformations, allowing for the rapid generation of molecular complexity. While progress has been made in their synthetic metholodology, the construction of &#946;&#8208;tertiary and C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes remains a synthetic challenge due to substrate limitations and steric hindrance issues. An approach is presented that utilizes synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis to achieve efficient C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, which can easily be obtained from alkyl carboxylic acids, with diborylmethyl species, providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176; &#946; positions. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to complex medicinal compounds and natural products, offering rapid access to molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;rich drug candidates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that diborylmethyl Cu(I) species participated in both the photoredox process and the key C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming step.

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Roles of Ferric Peroxide Anion Intermediates (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) in Cytochrome P450 19A1 Steroid Aromatization and a Cytochrome P450 2B4 Secosteroid Oxidation Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although most cytochrome P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations are believed to utilize perferryl oxygen (Compound I) as a reactive iron species, the ferric peroxide species (Compound 0) is thought to catalyze some oxidative deformylations. This study revealed the dominant contribution of Compound 0 in the P450 19A1&#8208;catalyzed steroid aromatization and P450 2B4&#8208;catalyzed model aromatization reactions, utilizing deuterium and 18O labeling approaches.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) 19A1 is the steroid aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the 3&#8208;step conversion of androgens (androstenedione or testosterone) to estrogens. The final step is C&#8722;C bond scission (removing the 19&#8208;oxo group as formic acid) that proceeds via a historically controversial reaction mechanism. The two competing mechanistic possibilities involve a ferric peroxide anion (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) and a perferryl oxy species (FeO3+, Compound I). One approach to discern the role of each species in the reaction is with the use of oxygen&#8208;18 labeling, i.e., from 18O2 and H218O of the reaction product formic acid. We applied this approach, using several technical improvements, to study the deformylation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione by human P450 19A1 and of a model secosteroid, 3&#8208;oxodecaline&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;10&#8208;carboxaldehyde (ODEC), by rabbit P450 2B4. Both aldehyde substrates were sensitive to non&#8208;enzymatic acid&#8208;catalyzed deformylation, yielding 19&#8208;norsteroids, and conditions were established to avoid issues with artifactual generation of formic acid. The Compound 0 reaction pathway predominated (i.e., Fe3+O2&#8722;) in both P450 19A1 oxidation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione and P450 2B4 oxidation of ODEC. The P450 19A1 results contrast with our prior conclusions (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 15016&#8211;16025), attributed to several technical modifications.

         <title>Radical Fluorosulfonamidation: A Facile Access to Sulfamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) was designed and synthesized as a redox&#8208;active fluorosulfamoyl radical precursor, which can be applied in radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. Further utilization in the radical 1,2&#8208;functionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions of olefins is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Recently, the introduction of fluorosulfonyl (&#8722;SO2F) groups have attracted considerable research interests, as this moiety could often afford enhanced activities and new functions in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1&#8208;fluorosulfamoyl&#8208;pyridinium (FSAP) salts, which could serve as an effective photoredox&#8208;active precursor to fluorosulfamoyl radicals and enable the direct radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. This method features mild conditions, visible light, broad substrate scope, good group tolerance, etc., and a metal&#8208;free protocol is also viable by using organic photocatalysts. Further, FSAP can also be applied to the radical functionalization of alkenes via 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical&#8208;polar crossover reactions, etc. In addition, a formal C&#8722;H methylamination of (hetero)arenes by combining this radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation with subsequent hydrolysis as well as product derivatization are also demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;1-Fluorosulfamoyl-pyridinium (FSAP) was designed and synthesized as a redox-active fluorosulfamoyl radical precursor, which can be applied in radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes. Further utilization in the radical 1,2-functionalization, radical distal migration, tandem radical-polar crossover reactions of olefins is also demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the introduction of fluorosulfonyl (&#8722;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) groups have attracted considerable research interests, as this moiety could often afford enhanced activities and new functions in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1-fluorosulfamoyl-pyridinium (FSAP) salts, which could serve as an effective photoredox-active precursor to fluorosulfamoyl radicals and enable the direct radical C&#8722;H fluorosulfonamidation of a variety of (hetero)arenes.

         <title>Interfacial Ir&#8208;V Direct Metal Bonding Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Activity in Vanadium Oxides Supported Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different interfacial bonds are ingeniously constructed to explore the regulating mechanism of the interfacial environment on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where V2O3 supported Ir catalyst (Ir&#8208;V2O3) with Ir&#8208;V bonding achieves the superior activity due to the accelerated RDS by the electrons injection from V to Ir.







Abstract
Tuning the interfacial structure of metal oxide substrates is an essential strategy to induce electronic structure reconstruction of supported catalysts, which is of great importance in optimizing their catalytic activities. Herein, vanadium oxides&#8208;supported Ir catalysts (Ir&#8208;V2O3, Ir&#8208;VO2, and Ir&#8208;V2O5) with different interfacial bonding environments (Ir&#8208;V, Ir&#8208;Obri, and Ir&#8208;O, respectively) were investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The regulating mechanism of the influence of different interfacial bonding environments on HER activity was investigated by both experimental results and computational evidence. Benefiting from the unique advantages of interfacial Ir&#8208;V direct metal bonds in Ir&#8208;V2O3, including enhanced electron transfer and electron donation ability, an optimized HER performance can be obtained with lowest overpotentials of 16 and 26&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, high mass activities of 11.24 and 6.66&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and turnover frequency values of 11.20 and 6.63&#8197;s&#8722;1, in acidic and alkaline conditions respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Ir&#8208;V2O3||RuO2 anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer requires only 1.92&#8197;V to achieve a high current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and realizes long&#8208;term stability. This study provides essential insights into the regulating mechanism of interfacial chemical bonding in electrocatalysts and offers a new pathway to design noble metal catalysts for different applications.

         <title>Unprecedented Packing Polymorphism of Oxindole: An Exploration Inspired by Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of computational predictions, along with innovative crystallization techniques for oxindole, has led to the discovery of four new forms and the reconstruction of a previously presumed &#8220;disappearing polymorph&#8221;. The findings have established a new record for the largest number of packing polymorphs for rigid organic systems, where variations are indeed due to distinct crystalline packing arrangements with the same molecular conformation.







Abstract
Crystal polymorphism, characterized by different packing arrangements of the same compound, strongly ties to the physical properties of a molecule. Determining the polymorphic landscape is complex and time&#8208;consuming, with the number of experimentally observed polymorphs varying widely from molecule to molecule. Furthermore, disappearing polymorphs, the phenomenon whereby experimentally observed forms cannot be reproduced, pose a significant challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, we focused on oxindole (OX), a small rigid molecule with four known polymorphs, including a reported disappearing form. Using crystal structure prediction (CSP), we assessed OX solid&#8208;state landscape and thermodynamic stability by comparing predicted structures with experimentally known forms. We then performed melt and solution crystallization in bulk and nanoconfinement to validate our predictions. These experiments successfully reproduced the known forms and led to the discovery of four novel polymorphs. Our approach provided insights into reconstructing disappearing polymorphs and building more comprehensive polymorph landscapes. These results also establish a new record of packing polymorphism for rigid molecules.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Prediction&#8208;Oriented Synthesis of Thiophosphates as Promising Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the guidance of theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric alkali and alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates ACaPS4 have been synthesized successfully. Comprehensive characterizations indicate that the ACaPS4 family could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, considering the wide band gap, moderate birefringence, high LIDT, and phase&#8208;matching large SHG response.







Abstract
Oriented synthesis of functional materials is a focus of attention in material science. As one of the most important function materials, infrared nonlinear optical materials with large second harmonic generation effects and broad optical band gap are in urgent need. In this work, directed by the theoretical structure prediction, the first series of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) alkali&#8208;alkaline earth metal [PS4]&#8208;based thiophosphates LiCaPS4 (Ama2), NaCaPS4 (P21), KCaPS4 (Pna21), RbCaPS4 (Pna21), CsCaPS4 (Pna21) were successfully synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that ACaPS4 could be regarded as promising IR NLO materials, exhibiting wide band gap (3.77&#8211;3.86&#8197;eV), moderate birefringence (0.027&#8211;0.064 at 1064&#8197;nm), high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT, ~10&#215;AGS), and suitable phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation responses (0.4&#8211;0.6&#215;AGS). Structure&#8208;properties analyses illustrate that the Ca&#8722;S bonds show non&#8208;ignorable covalent feature, and [PS4] together with [CaSn] units play dominant roles to determine the band gap and SHG response. This work indicates that Li&#8208;, Na&#8208; and K&#8208; analogs may be promising infrared nonlinear optical material candidates, and this is the first successful case of &#8220;prediction to synthesis&#8221; involving infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals in the thiophosphate system and may provide a new avenue to the design and oriented synthesis of high&#8208;performance function materials in the future.
