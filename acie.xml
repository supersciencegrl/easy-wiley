         <title>Acid&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;photon Absorption Switch via Cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;Salt&#8208;to&#8208;Cocrystal Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation, we construct for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch between upconversion and Stokes emission. This single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) interconvert for 20 cycles, demonstrating an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials, which holds promising applications in display devices and rewritable information storage.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive organic cocrystals are typically governed by single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation, remaining a long&#8208;standing challenge due to disruption of long&#8208;range order structure throughout the whole solid&#8208;state process. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an acid&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) switch based on reversible cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal SCSC transformation. While both para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene and meta&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene coassemble with 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) into cocrystals via donor&#8211;acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonds, only the former cocrystal exhibits broad&#8208;window TPA activity alongside enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Theoretical calculations confirm that positional isomerism of electron donors modulates molecular coplanarity and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in cocrystals, directly controlling TPA cross&#8208;sections. Remarkably, para&#8208;N&#8208;dipyridylanthracene undergoes diprotonation by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid, enabling the conversion of the cocrystal to a salt form, which can be reverted upon triethylamine treatment. This cocrystal&#8208;to&#8208;salt&#8208;to&#8208;cocrystal transformation switches the TPA characteristics with reversible color changes between upconversion orange emission and Stokes yellow luminescence for 20 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is an unprecedented performance for stimuli&#8208;responsive organic materials. Based on the unique acid&#8208;responsive emission, we also apply the SCSC transformation in display devices and information storage. This study elucidates structure&#8208;property relationships governing TPA in cocrystals and establishes a new paradigm for stimuli&#8208;responsive optical switches.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Chemically Recyclable Polyamides via Substituent Effects&#8208;Enabled Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The joint presence of ketone and diester functionalities in dimethyl acetone&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylate enhances its reactivity toward amines compared to the individual reactivity of each group, due to substituent effects. This increased reactivity enables the efficient synthesis of polyamides under mild conditions, and the resulting polymers are chemically recyclable.








Abstract
Imination and amidation are two fundamental condensation reactions central to modern chemical synthesis, and devising energy&#8208;efficient ways to trigger them is highly relevant in advancing low&#8208;carbon manufacturing, with most approaches relying on the use of catalysts. Here, we revisit the dimethyl acetone&#8208;1,3&#8208;dicarboxylate (DADC) chemistry, and show that it can react with a broad range of small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular amines at moderate temperatures (80&#8210;120&#160;&#176;C) in the absence of any catalysts. This represents a significant reduction in processing temperatures compared to traditional polycondensation methods for polyamide synthesis, which often require temperatures exceeding 230&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic and model studies reveal that the high reactivity of DADC toward amines arises from its synergistic substituent effects; Specifically, the two ester groups in the symmetric &#946;&#8208;position of DADC&#8217;s ketone facilitate initial imination via conjugation and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects, generating a &#946;&#8208;enamino intermediate. This &#946;&#8208;enamine subsequently engages in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with one ester group, reducing steric hindrance on the remaining ester and thus promoting its amidation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the DADC&#8208;synthesized polyamides are thermally reprocessable, and chemically recyclable under either acidic or basic conditions at mild temperatures, and the chemical recycling is possible both for the neat polymer and its mixture with other plastics.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries through Halogen Bonding Inversion and Non&#8208;Identical&#8208;Frequency Molecular Vibrations</title>

         <dc:description>
The charge preanisotropy of ClAN forms &#963;&#8208;holes specific adsorption, which assures electron&#8208;scale manageable coordination to high valence iodine species (I+). The non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency vibrations response of ClAN with water molecules leads to rapid migration in protic solvents. The combination of the two drives the targeted coordination of the electrolyte additives to I+, breaking the reliance on the &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte in conventional multi&#8208;electron transfer zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The activation of four&#8208;electron transfer behavior through I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion reactions is crucial for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) but is hindered by the rapid hydrolysis of I+ in protic solvents. Theoretically, the directionality and modifiability of halogen bonds (XBs) can be used to regulate the hydrolytic disproportionation of I+. Given that the conventional coordination configuration is not applicable because of the locking of the XB donor (I+), the inversion of the coordination configuration to establish a charge distribution preanisotropy (&#963;&#8208;holes) and thus realize XB&#8208;stabilizing electron&#8208;scale coordination is vital for breaking down the barriers existing in protic solvents. To counteract external environmental disturbances, the cohesive energy differentiation based on the Hansen parameter creates the non&#8208;identical&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations of additives with water. Herein, an electrolyte additive (chloroacetonitrile, ClAN) with these advantages enabled the redox coupling of I&#8722;/I0/I+ at a very low salt concentration (4 molar kg&#8722;1). The corresponding ZIB exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 175.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and showed an extremely high specific capacity at high rates (133.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a generalized framework and new horizons for halogen batteries with multiple electron transfers.

         <title>KF&#183;[SO2(NH2)2]: the First Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Sulfonamide Fluoride Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Novel Cairo Pentagonal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the halide salt ionic framework construction strategy, the first sulfonamide fluoride, KF&#183;[SO2(NH2)2], was successfully synthesized, featuring a novel Cairo pentagonal structure with electroneutral SO2(NH2)2 groups stabled. It achieves a balance of a large SHG response of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP@1064&#160;nm, a large birefringence of 0.079@546&#160;nm, and a DUV cutoff edge of&#160;&lt;&#160;190&#160;nm.








Abstract
The sulfonamide group (SO2(NH2)2) shows great potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals due to its strong hyperpolarizability and anisotropy, but its neutrality and poor protonation limit its application. Here, we propose a new design strategy that introduces an ionic framework via halide salts to both stabilize sulfonamide molecules and control their orientation, thereby enabling desirable second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence. Following this concept, the first sulfonamide fluoride, KF&#183;[SO2(NH2)2], was successfully synthesized, with SO2(NH2)2 units firmly anchored in the KF lattice by K&#9472;O ionic and N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F hydrogen bonds. Remarkably, this crystal exhibits a unique and compact Cairo pentagonal configuration. Benefiting from its well&#8208;ordered structure, the crystal exhibits a strong SHG response of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm, a large birefringence of 0.079@546&#160;nm, and a short cutoff edge below 190&#160;nm. This work opens new avenues for the design of advanced NLO crystals with a sulfonamide group.

Following this concept, the first sulfonamide fluoride, KF&#183;[SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], was successfully synthesized, with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units firmly anchored in the KF lattice by K&#9472;O ionic and N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F hydrogen bonds. Remarkably, this crystal exhibits a unique and compact Cairo pentagonal configuration. Benefiting from its well-ordered structure, the crystal exhibits a strong SHG response of 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm, a large birefringence of 0.079@546&#160;nm, and a short cutoff edge below 190&#160;nm. This work opens new avenues for the design of advanced NLO crystals with a sulfonamide group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reaction via Photoinduced Pd and Pd/Ir Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction is designed by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. Both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;allyl skeletons are achievable and stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is realized.








Abstract
Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction typically relies on the use of alkenes containing an &#945;&#8208;leaving group as the substrates. In comparison, an in situ assembling model from feedstock chemicals represents a distinctive and practically valuable route, yet remains undeveloped. Here we report an unprecedented excited Pd&#8208;catalyzed in situ assembling Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction by using readily available alkenes, esters, and nucleophiles as substrates. With the development of a HAT/Heck/allylation cascade protocol, various (E)&#8208;allyl compounds are prepared in good yields and stereoselectivities. Meanwhile, a novel photoinduced Pd/Ir relay catalysis is designed to enable stereoselective preparation of challenging (Z)&#8208;allyl compounds. Stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers [(E,R), (E,S), (Z,R), and (Z,S)] is also realized via this excited&#8208;state Pd chemistry, different from typical ground&#8208;state catalytic models. A broad range of N&#8208;, C&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;derived nucleophiles and different alkenes and esters show high compatibility with the transformation. The protocol is further applied to the concise synthesis of seven bioactive molecules from bulk materials, highlighting the reliability, generality, and practical value of the design. Mechanistic studies support the present design.

         <title>A Highly Selective Nucleophilic and Radical Relay Difluorination of Cyclopropanes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and practical synthetic method has been realized for highly selective 1,3&#8208;difluorination of cyclopropanes and 1,2&#8208;difluorination of styrenes under mild conditions. Relay nucleophilic and radical fluorination allows for a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance.








Abstract
Fluoro&#8208;containing organic compounds have been found wide application in pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries and in medical diagnostics. In this field, the construction of C&#9472;F bonds through nucleophilic fluorination strategies remains highly challenging. Herein, we have developed a radical&#8208;polar strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nucleophilic fluorination and subsequent radical fluorination, allowing for direct difluorination of cyclopropanes and styrenes under mild reaction conditions. It affords a series of structurally diverse, both 1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;difluorinated products in synthetically useful yields by means of &#8764;0.1 mol% of 4CzIPN as catalyst. Furthermore, only 3 equivalents of Et3N&#183;3HF are required to realize an efficient nucleophilic fluorination, while 1.7 equivalents of Selectfluor are used as the radical fluorinating source, demonstrating good functional group compatibility and thus can be applied in late&#8208;stage difluorination of complex molecules.

         <title>Quinuclidinium&#8208;Based Microporous Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microporous AEMs with extreme alkaline stability and confinement&#8208;induced high conductivity have been developed for water electrolysis. The presented membrane, poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip), exhibited high OH&#8722; conductivity and record&#8208;setting alkaline stability. The water electrolyzers configured with PTPQ&#8208;Trip can tolerate varied temperatures, current densities, alkaline concentrations, and operation interruptions, and operate continuously under high alkaline concentrations. This work promises the integration of renewable electricity for water electrolysis.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) is a promising green hydrogen production method; however, it is constrained by the moderate OH&#8722; conductivity and inadequate alkaline stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Here we report a series of quinuclidinium&#8208;based AEMs with branched and microporous structures, achieving 99.95% OH&#8722; conductivity retention after 3100&#160;h in 10&#160;M NaOH at 80 &#176;C. By tuning the rigidity of the branching units to limit chain packing, micropores were created to enhance OH&#8722; transport, which improved the diffusion coefficient of OH&#8722; by 1.6 times within the poly (terphenyl&#8208;triptycene&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PTPQ&#8208;Trip) membrane having the most rigid structure. An AEMWE configured with a PTPQ&#8208;Trip membrane and nickel&#8208;alloy catalysts can tolerate varied alkaline concentrations and deliver a hydrogen production current density of 2.8 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V in 5&#160;M KOH, which can be continuously operated at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 and 30 &#176;C for over 1200 h, with intentionally included stop/start interruptions. The assembled AEMWE demonstrated stable operation for 1400 h under alternating operational current densities and varying electrolyte temperatures. This work underscores the critical role of alkaline&#8208;resistant microporous AEMs and highlights the adaptability of AEMWE for hydrogen production using renewable electricity.

         <title>Regioselective Zr5 Nanocluster Photocatalyst for Precise Protein Editing Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster serves as an efficient heterogeneous photocatalyst for regioselective oxidative cleavage and side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme protein. Upon UV irradiation, it generates reactive oxygens species (ROS), with reaction selectivity guided by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the cluster's positively charged surface and electrostatically negatively charged regions on the protein near the cleavage sites.








Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modifications on protein structure and function is of central importance in protein chemistry, necessitating precise and controlled methods for introducing such modifications. Herein, we report a strategy for regioselective chemical editing of a protein using a novel Zr5&#160;nanocluster&#160;as a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst. The&#160; [ZrIV5(&#956;&#9472;&#927;&#919;)2(&#956;&#9472;&#927;)2(&#956;3&#9472;&#927;)Cl2(H2O)6(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1&#8208;tBu&#8208;dihyde&#8208;O,O&#8242;,O&#8243;)5] (Zr5) cluster features a unique [Zr5O5] structural motif and&#160;its electronic structure and light absorption properties&#160;were fully analyzed and reproduced through Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory&#160;(DFT) calculations.&#160;Zr5&#160;exhibits exceptional photophysical properties, including the optical gap of 2.01&#160;eV, the lowest reported to date for a zirconium&#8208;oxo cluster. Under light irradiation at 370&#160;nm, Zr5&#160;mediates the&#160;regioselective cleavage and oxidative side&#8208;chain modification of hen egg white lysozyme, producing&#160;fragments which are ideal for middle&#8208;down proteomics applications. Combined DFT and experimental approaches indicate that Zr5&#160;efficiently produces reactive oxygen species that mediate protein oxidation and cleavage. Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr5&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.

Comprehensive characterization&#160;confirmed the cluster's stability under reaction conditions, with no detectable structural changes or dissolution, enabling its reuse for multiple times without loss of catalytic efficiency. The unique photocatalytic properties of Zr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;offer new opportunities for precise protein functionalization and pave the way for extending them to other classes of molecular transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Predicting Reaction Feasibility and Selectivity of Aromatic C&#9472;H Thianthrenation with a QM&#8211;ML Hybrid Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the open&#8208;source machine learning model PATTCH, which predicts the reaction feasibility and site&#8208;selectivity of aromatic C&#9472;H thianthrenation reactions. The model was built using both literature data and newly generated experimental data. PATTCH makes accurate predictions within minutes, and we show its application in multiple case studies, including prospective experimental verification.








Abstract
The direct thianthrenation of aromatic C&#9472;H bonds is a valuable late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy that can assist, for example, the development of new drugs. We herein present a predictive computational model for this reaction, denoted PATTCH, which is based on semiempirical quantum mechanics and machine learning. It classifies each Caromatic&#8211;H unit either as reactive or not with an accuracy of above 90%. It can address both the site&#8208;selectivity and reaction feasibility question associated with the thianthrenation protocol. First, this was achieved by selecting carefully engineered features, which take into account the electronic and steric influence on the site&#8208;selectivity. Second, parallel experimentation was used to supplement the available literature data with 54 new negative reactions (unsuccessful thianthrenation), which we show was instrumental for developing the PATTCH tool. Ultimately, we successfully applied the model to a challenging test set encompassing the differentiation between carbocycle versus heterocycle functionalization, the identification of substrates that were reported to result in a mixture of isomeric products, and to molecules that could not be thianthrenated. The computational predictions were experimentally validated. The PATTCH tool can be obtained free of charge from https://github.com/MolecularAI/thianthrenation_prediction.

         <title>K+ Vacancies and Fluorine Substitution Synergistically Regulate KTiOPO4 Anode for All&#8208;Climate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode structure with synergistically regulated K+ vacancies and O/F disorder has been achieved through F substitution. Practical full&#8208;cell testing confirms that this material exhibits excellent cycling stability, enhanced rate performance, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Although Ti&#8208;based polyanion anode materials with robust structures exhibit advantages such as high reversibility and high Coulombic efficiency for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage; however, their practical application is restricted by drawbacks including limited storage sites, low capacity, and intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a strategy of fluorine substitution combined with carbon coating of KTiOPO4 (KTPF/C), along with the introduction of K+ vacancies to activate additional potassium storage sites. The resulting KTPF/C material demonstrates a high capacity of 204.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, corresponding to the reversible storage of 1.27&#160;K+ ions. The synergistic effect of K+ vacancies and fluorine substitution not only lowers the operating voltage but also results in a more disordered structure, thereby reducing the volume change during potassiation/depotassiation to 7.3%. This enables an ultralong cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles with an extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.011&#8240; per cycle. Moreover, the cooperation of K+ vacancies and carbon coating facilitates the transport of K+ and electrons, allowing the material to maintain excellent rate performance of 125.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1. Practical full&#8208;cell testing further confirms the material's outstanding cycling stability, high power density, and all&#8208;climate applicability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Acyclic Tripodal Receptors as Ultrahigh Superprotonic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of proton&#8208;conducting tripodal receptors, namely, Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P and Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P with differently functionalized tails have been designed to act as anchors for the intrinsically crystallized proton carrier (H3PO4/H2PO4&#8722;). Distinct variation in H&#8208;bonded architectures marked for 1000 times higher proton conductivity of Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) than that for Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P (3.08&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1) at 80 &#176;C under 80% RH.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state proton&#8208;conductors (SSPCs) with high conductivity and excellent chemical stability are the key requirements for proton exchange membrane fuel&#8208;cell systems. Herein, inspired by the acyclic supramolecular chemistry, we inaugurate a new class of proton&#8208;conducting tripodal receptor based hydrogen&#8208;bonded platforms, namely, Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P and Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P, with differently functionalized tails. The receptors act as anchors for the intrinsically crystallized proton carriers (H3PO4 and H2PO4&#8722;) through multiple host&#8208;guest interactions and thus eventually address leaching issues with externally doped phosphoric acid from SSPCs. Distinct variation in structural engineering through &#8220;complementary docking strategy&#8221; coupled with striking variation in H&#8208;bonded architectures (continuous versus closed loops) marked for three orders higher proton conductivity of Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) than that for Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P (3.08&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1) at 80 &#176;C under 80% RH. Quantum&#8208;chemical simulation revealed a smaller proton transfer energy barrier (EPT) in Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P (13.7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 and 1.7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 for channel&#8208;a and b, along with an energetically favourable &#8220;quantum tunnelling effect&#8221; in channel&#8208;b) than in Tripod&#8208;NO2&#8208;P (24.9&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Such a unique framework engineering served as an effective tool for flaunting tripodal receptor Tripod&#8208;COOH&#8208;P as a new zoner ultrahigh proton conducting platform (beyond&#160;&gt;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1).

         <title>Reduction of Rare&#8208;Earth Stannole Sandwich Complexes to Tin&#8208;Based Radical Ligands and Tin&#8211;Tin Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of dimetallic rare&#8208;earth stannole complexes with KC8 produces a di&#8208;tin radical ligand that shows strong coupling between tin and yttrium, gadolinium or dysprosium. Two&#8208;electron reduction of the stannole complexes further populates a delocalized {M2Sn2} molecular orbital, enhancing the tin&#8211;tin bonding and simultaneously dearomatizing the stannole rings.








Abstract
f&#8208;Element organometallic chemistry is dominated by cyclopentadienyl ligands. In contrast, isoelectronic metallole ligands with the general formula [EC4R4]2&#8722;, where E is a heavier group 14 element, are rare in the f&#8208;block, particularly stannole ligands. Here, we describe the synthesis of the dimetallic stannole complexes [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)]2 (1M&#160;; M&#160;=&#160;Y, Gd, Dy; CpSn = [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8211;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;, Cpttt = [1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2]&#8722;), which form by virtue of Sn&#8594;M dative bonds. One&#8208;electron reduction of 1M with KC8/2.2.2&#8208;cryptand produces the mono&#8208;anionic complexes [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]&#8722; (2M), and two&#8208;electron reduction gives di&#8208;anionic [{(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)M(&#951;5&#8208;Cpttt)}2]2&#8722; (3M) as [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts. Studies of the stannole complexes using crystallography, UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy, magnetometry and computational methods reveal that the reduction steps generate tin&#8211;tin bonds through population of a delocalized molecular orbital that spans the {M2Sn2} rings, with attendant dearomatization of the stannole rings. Complexes 2M are the first tin&#8208;radical ligands bound to rare earth elements. Spin density calculations of 2Y and 2Gd reveal significant build&#8208;up of unpaired spin on the tin atoms, with magnetic measurements on 2Gd yielding an unprecedentedly large tin&#8211;gadolinium exchange coupling constant of &#8722;112&#160;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2J formalism).

&lt;p&gt;One-electron reduction of dimetallic rare-earth stannole complexes with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; produces a di-tin radical ligand that shows strong coupling between tin and yttrium, gadolinium or dysprosium. Two-electron reduction of the stannole complexes further populates a delocalized {M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} molecular orbital, enhancing the tin&#8211;tin bonding and simultaneously dearomatizing the stannole rings.

         <title>Electronic Structure&#8208;Engineered Proton Depletion Interfaces on Ternary RuO2 for Ultra&#8208;Stable Kilowatt Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Achieving kilowatt&#8208;level PEM water electrolysis for hydrogen production by self&#8208;accelerating interfacial proton consumption through the creation of local operando alkaline microenvironments.








Abstract
Advancing high&#8208;current PEM water electrolysis (PEMWE) is crucial for terawatt&#8208;scale green hydrogen economies, but anode catalyst stability under industrial conditions remains a key barrier to system efficiency and longevity. Here, we present a ternary RuO2&#8208;based catalyst (Cr0.1Sn0.1Ru0.8O2) that addresses these limitations through proton depletion interface engineering, with electronic structure modulation inherently integrated into the catalyst design. The resulting catalyst reaches a current density of 3.0 amperes per square centimeter at only 1.77 volts and a low degradation for oxygen evolution over 1000&#160;h in PEMWE. A scaled&#8208;up system incorporating this anode catalyst further attains a hundred&#8208;ampere level water electrolysis, with kilowatt scale which propels the large&#8208;scale deployment of hydrogen production utilizing renewable energy sources. Our techno&#8208;economic analysis predicts that leveraging this anode architecture can reduce hydrogen production costs below $1 per kg H2 while maintaining a substantially lower environmental footprint relative to conventional electrolyzer technologies.

         <title>Atomic Structure Design for Enhancing Metal&#8208;Support Frontier Orbital Interaction to Achieve Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on atomic structure design, this study developed AuNPsNi1CN photocatalyst, a novel structure with defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal nanoparticle loading strategies. N vacancies enhance the metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between Ni single atoms and the g&#8208;C3N4, improving H+ supply capacity through 4e&#8722; WOR. Au nanoparticles serve as 2e&#8722; ORR sites, achieving an H2O2 yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water.








Abstract
Modified g&#8208;C3N4 has been widely applied in various photocatalytic reactions. However, designing efficient atomic structures, breaking through the activity bottleneck and elucidating the precise reaction mechanisms remain the critical challenges in photocatalyst development. This work developed one innovative photocatalyst atomic structure design (AuNPsNi1CN) with Ni single atoms, N vacancies and Au nanoparticles (NPs) at g&#8208;C3N4. N vacancies enhancing metal&#8208;support frontier orbital interaction between the Ni electron orbitals and the g&#8208;C3N4&#8217;s frontier orbitals, forming a highly active site for four&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (4e&#8722; WOR), which significantly enhanced the proton (H&#8314;) supply capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the introduced Au NPs produce H2O2 via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), achieving a yield of 437.53&#160;&#181;M&#183;h&#8722;1 in pure water. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Ni single atoms cause a regulation in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), enhancing the oxidation capability of holes, while the Au NPs optimize O2 adsorption energy and lower the reaction barrier for 2e&#8722; ORR. This atomic&#8208;scale structure design strategy combining defect engineering, single&#8208;atom anchoring, and metal NPs loading, provides a novel approach for developing efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Formal C&#9472;H Functionalization of Quinolines at the C7 Position Through a Traceless Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the remote C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates has been achieved by using a traceless N&#8208;acyl directing group, providing an efficient and practical strategy for the synthesis of a new family of C7&#8208;functionalized quinolines with high regioselectivity.








Abstract
The precise C&#9472;H functionalization of quinolines is of high interest in organic synthesis and drug discovery. However, although many strategies have been developed for the regioselective C&#9472;H bond functionalization of the quinoline scaffold, the facile and selective remote C&#9472;H bond functionalization of quinolines at the geometrically and electronically disfavored C7&#8208;position has remained underdeveloped. Here, we disclose a Cu&#8208;catalyzed formal C&#9472;H arylation and alkenylation of quinolines at the C7 position with diverse iodonium triflates. The reaction features exclusive C7&#8208;selectivity, broad substrate scope, short reaction time, and simple operation. This practical protocol has also been applied in the analogous C7&#8208;H functionalization of tetrahydroquinolines and the further C7&#8208;elaboration of quinolines. Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the key to the success of this transformation is the unique ring&#8208;size&#8208;induced in situ removal of the N&#8208;acyl directing group, constituting a traceless directing strategy for the rapid access to a variety of C7&#8208;substituted neutral quinolines.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regiodivergent Allyl&#8208;Propargyl Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions for the Construction of 1,4&#8208;Enallenes and 1,5&#8208;Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemo&#8208; and regiodivergent allyl&#8208;propargyl cross&#8208;coupling reactions of propargyl carbonates with allyl boronates has been realized. The role of ligands in determining both the chemoselectivity and regioselectivity is of particular importance, as they modulate the 1,1&#8242;&#8208; or 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination mode from the same &#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;allenylpalladium intermediate.








Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent transformations represent a vital strategy for the efficient production of structurally diverse molecules from the same readily available precursors. Herein, we report the palladium/phosphine&#8208;catalyst&#8208;driven chemo&#8208; and regiodivergent allyl&#8208;propargyl cross&#8208;coupling of propargyl carbonates with allyl boronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the bidentate phosphine ligand plays a crucial role in determining the relative favorability of possible reductive elimination modes from the &#414;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#414;1&#8208;allenyl palladium intermediate species. Specifically, MeO&#8208;BIPHEP facilitates the 1,1&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination to form the 1,4&#8208;enallenes; in contrast, XantPhos favors the formation of 1,5&#8208;enynes through a 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination pathway.

         <title>Cupin&#8208;Type Dimethylsulfoniopropionate Lyase from Pelagibacter ubique (DddKPu) Catalyzes Aza&#8208;Michael Addition of Primary and Secondary Amines to Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase (DddK) was identified as an efficient aza&#8208;Michaelase for the addition of amines to acrylate. Screening 74 amines with wild&#8208;type DddK and its W26G variant yielded N&#8208;substituted and N,N&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;amino acids in 30%&#8211;93% isolated yield. This versatile method enables access to novel &#946;&#8208;amino acids, which serve as valuable building blocks for pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The formation of carbon&#9472;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis, underpinning the production of amines, imines, and nitriles found in numerous active ingredients. Among the methods for C&#9472;N bond formation, the aza&#8208;Michael addition stands out as a powerful and versatile approach. Herein, we present a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient aza&#8208;Michael addition of primary and secondary amines to acrylic acid, i.e., aza&#8208;Michaelase activity, leveraging the promiscuity of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) lyase from Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062 (DddKPu). In vivo DddKPu catalyzes the &#946;&#8208;elimination of DMSP to sodium acrylate and dimethylsulfide (i.e., a retro sulfa&#8208;Michael reaction). Here, we screened DddKPu against a diverse library of 30 primary and 44 secondary amines. The wild&#8208;type enzyme achieved 90%&#8211;100% conversion and 40%&#8211;86% isolated yields of N,N&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids with secondary amines. For primary amines, the W26G variant proved optimal, furnishing 50%&#8211;100% conversion and 43%&#8211;81% isolated yields of N&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Notably, the enzyme exhibited remarkable chemoselectivity: for pyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, the reaction occurred exclusively at the secondary amine, while for piperidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanamine, it reacted selectively at the primary amine. These findings highlight DddKPu as a versatile biocatalyst for the selective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids, expanding the toolbox for C&#9472;N bond formation.

         <title>A Heterodimetallic Monomeric Complex with a Uranium&#8211;Cobalt Triple Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a crystallographically confirmed heterodimetallic monomeric complex (TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co) featuring a U&#8801;Co triple bond (2.189&#160;&#197;). Remarkably, this complex could act as a catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkyne.








Abstract
The crystal structure of heterodimetallic monomeric complexes featuring a U&#8211;M triple bond has been rarely reported. Here, we present an example of a heterodimetallic monomeric complex [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Co)] (4) containing a U&#8211;Co triple bond, which was synthesized by the reaction of [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U(Cl)] (2) or [(TrapenCH2PPh2)U] (3) with CoCl2 in the presence of KC8. The crystal structure of 4 reveals a highly&#160;symmetrical&#160;geometry with a linear Co&#8211;U&#8211;Namine axis line, and the U&#8211;Co bond length 2.1890(11) &#197; is slightly longer than the sum of the covalent triple&#8208;bond radii of uranium and cobalt (2.14&#160;&#197;). The U&#8211;Namine bond length (2.439(6) &#197;) is significantly shortened compared to that of precursors 2 and 3. The significant contraction of the U&#8211;Namine bond demonstrates electronic reinforcement via the inverse trans&#8208;influence (ITI). Detailed computational investigations further support the existence of a U&#8801;Co triple bond in 4, and the formal oxidation states of uranium and cobalt appear to be U(IV) and Co(&#8208;I). The low&#8208;temperature magnetic moments of 4 are approaching 2.1 &#956;B, which is attributed to its near&#8208;doubly degenerate spin&#8208;orbit ground states in the pseudo&#8208;C3v symmetry. Remarkably, 4 served as the catalyst for the hydroboration and dimerization of terminal alkynes under mild conditions.

         <title>Biomedical Applications of Nanozymes: An Enzymology Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a lens of enzymology, this review compares nanozymes with enzymes using the Michaelis&#8208;Menten model and differences in KM and kcat along with catalysis in complex biological environment. The implications of these differences in biomedical applications of nanozymes are then described with a statistical analysis of the trend of therapeutic use of nanozymes. 








Abstract
Nanozymes are catalytic nanomaterials that transform enzyme substrates into their corresponding products, offering enhanced stability and a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional enzymes. As nanomaterials, they possess unique physicochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms distinct from those of enzymes. Such differences have profound, yet often neglected, implications in biomedical applications. In the context of enzymology, this review compares nanozymes and enzymes, with a focus on redox reactions. This review begins with the classification of nanozymes based on the types of reactions they catalyze, with the ability to exhibit multiple catalytic activities being a prevalent characteristic. The use of the Michaelis&#8208;Menten model for both enzymes and nanozymes is discussed in detail, and the Michaelis constant, maximum reaction rate, and turnover number values are compared. The performance of nanozymes in crowded environments and under extreme conditions is also compared to that of enzymes. We discuss the kinetic factors influencing nanozyme performance, the impact of active site shielding, and the activity under non&#8208;physiological conditions. We then compiled recent trends in the biomedical applications of nanozymes, focusing on both the production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species. This review links fundamental enzymology to nanozyme catalysis, providing a key reference for the rational use of nanozymes.

In view of the optimal activity of glucose oxidase (GOD) at pH 5.5 and lower pH values in the tumor microenvironment (TME), a self&#8208;homing GOD&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) was designed. This nanorobotic system can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) through &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis and pH&#8208;guided chemotactic motion, achieving a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency for enhanced glioblastoma (GBM) chemotherapy. 








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a substantial obstacle in therapy since the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and tumor microenvironment (TME) severely prevent the access of most exogenous therapeutic agents to the central nervous system. Overcoming this dual defense established by BBB&#8208;TME is a critical challenge in GBM therapy. Here, we present a glucose oxidase (GOD)&#8208;powered liposomal nanobot (lipoNbot) to breach the BBB&#8208;TME through self&#8208;homing navigation guided by the acid and glucose in TME&#8212;a mechanism rooted in the regulation of GOD activity, with optimal performance in acidic environments to actively deliver drugs for GBM chemotherapy. The lipoNbot features an asymmetric structure composed of GOD&#8208;modified cancer cell membranes and &#947;&#8208;glutamylated lipids, which synergistically enhance BBB&#8208;TME penetration through chemotactic diffusiophoresis and &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transferase (GGT)&#8208;mediated transcytosis. The proton sponge effect facilitates lysosomal escape for BBB traversal. In vivo investigation indicates that lipoNbots achieve a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in delivery efficiency. Such a lipoNbot poses the specific biochemical cues of GBM for self&#8208;homing navigation, establishing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept framework utilizing the pathological features for active therapy of central nervous system diseases.

         <title>A Photothermal Nano&#8208;Switch for Tumor&#8208;Selective Wnt Hyperactivation in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) is presented for precise, spatiotemporal modulation of Wnt signaling. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis.








Abstract
Wnt signaling plays a paradoxical role in cancer, functioning as both a promoter and suppressor depending on its activation level. This duality underscores the critical need for precise and selective modulation, while existing Wnt&#8208;targeting strategies fail to achieve it due to inadequate specificity and control. Here, we report a photothermal nano&#8208;switch based on Wnt inhibitory factor&#8208;1 (Wif1) and Wnt&#8208;functionalized gold nanorods (Au&#8208;PEG/Wif1/Wnt) that enables spatiotemporal and selective activation of the Wnt pathway. Upon near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, localized heating disrupts Wif1&#8208;Wnt interactions, triggering controlled Wnt protein release. The liberated Wnt ligands, combined with mild photothermal heating, hyperactivate the Wnt pathway specifically by inhibiting the phosphorylation of &#946;&#8208;catenin in tumor cells, thus inducing epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, &#946;&#8208;catenin nuclear translocation, and apoptosis. In contrast, normal cells remain unaffected due to their lower basal Wnt activity, as confirmed by negligible cytotoxicity and unaltered apoptotic markers. In vivo, this system achieves robust antitumor effects in a 4T1 breast cancer model while ensuring safety for healthy tissues. By leveraging the optical properties of gold nanorods for conditional and selective activation, this study establishes a transformative platform for the precise modulation of Wnt signaling, offering significant promise for treating Wnt&#8208;dysregulated diseases with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Split Personality in Polymer with Intrinsic Microporosity&#8208;Based Artificial Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral building blocks have been employed to construct chiral polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM), serving as the foundation for artificial ion channels. This approach has resulted in distinct configurations and contrasting ion transport behaviors, governed by the constituent chiral blocks. This work presents a split personality in a multifunctional, chiral PIM&#8208;based artificial ion channel system while marking the first application of chiral polymers in transmembrane transport.








Abstract
The construction of artificial transmembrane ion channels using polymers has emerged as a promising research avenue in membrane transport. In this study, we have designed and synthesized an intriguing class of intrinsically microporous chiral polyimides (PIM&#8208;PIs) employing trans/cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexanes (DACH) as structural building blocks. Remarkably, these chiral PIM&#8208;PIs exhibit distinct configurations, leading to contrasting ion transport properties. The cis&#8208;DACH&#8208;derived chiral polymer 1 demonstrates the hitherto highest Li+ transport activity (&gt;100 pS), along with exceptionally high selectivity ratios for Li+/Na+ (17.1) and Li+/K+ (21.8). In contrast, chiral polymers 2a and 2b, synthesized from (1R,2R)&#8208;DACH and (1S,2S)&#8208;DACH, respectively, showcase pronounced anion transport capabilities and a remarkably high Cl&#8722;/K+ selectivity ratio of 17.6. This work introduces a multifunctional, chiral PIM&#8208;based artificial ion channel system with a &#8220;split personality&#8221; governed by its chiral constituents. It represents the first application of chiral polymers in transmembrane transport, inspiring innovative design strategies for developing polymer&#8208;based artificial ion channels.

         <title>Supramolecular Interactions Modulate RNA:DNA Folding Observed via Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state nanopores enable the detection of RNA species at the single&#8208;molecule level. To rapidly and accurately identify barcoded RNAs as they translocate the pore, it is imperative to reduce analyte folding. Here, we demonstrate that RNA's supramolecular interactions with urea inhibit folding, increasing the number of readable barcodes while decreasing the number of events required for RNA identification. 








Abstract
DNA and RNA nanotechnology enables the precise assembly of molecular architectures, with applications in bioengineering, supramolecular chemistry, and sensing. The material properties of these biopolymers can be adjusted covalently or, more simply, through non&#8208;covalent interactions with small molecules. Herein, we demonstrate the use of urea, an abundant and inexpensive small molecule, to modulate the stiffness of RNA:DNA hybrid nanostructures. Our results suggest that supramolecular interactions between urea and the A&#8208;form&#8208;like helix rigidify the hybrid polymers, as evidenced by both solid&#8208;state nanopore measurements and atomic force microscopy. Nanopore sensing reveals that preparing topologically&#8208;barcoded RNA:DNA hybrids in urea results in a 50% reduction in folded translocations. This decrease in folded events improves the proportion of useable data points, paving the way for the robust detection of low&#8208;abundance RNA analytes at the single&#8208;molecule level.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Promoted Reductive Regeneration on Cobalt Catalysts Enables Efficient Dual&#8208;Pathway Hydrazine Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway mechanism is unveiled for hydrazine oxidation on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and a mediated pathway involving Co(II)/Co(0) cycling. Defect engineering accelerates the chemical reduction of Co(II) by hydrazine, enabling rapid regeneration of Co(0) active site, boosting both activity and durability, and leading to efficient low&#8208;voltage hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) represents a promising low&#8208;energy pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, yet mechanistic ambiguities and catalyst instability hinder its practical implementation. Herein, we elucidate the dual&#8208;pathway nature of HzOR on cobalt&#8208;based catalysts, involving direct electrooxidation on metallic Co and mediated oxidation via the redox cycle between metallic Co and cobalt hydroxide species. This mechanistic insight moves beyond the traditional focus on solely enhancing the intrinsic activity in the direct pathway. Instead, it highlights the chemical redox reaction between hydrazine and Co(II) as a central process that not only regenerates metallic Co sites for direct pathway but also drives the mediated oxidation route. Guided by this understanding, we designed a defect&#8208;rich cobalt catalyst through a one&#8208;step electrodeposition method, enabling fast chemical reduction of oxidized Co species by hydrazine. As a result, the catalyst delivers superior HzOR performance, reaching a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only &#8722;79&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode, along with outstanding long&#8208;term stability. Combined electrochemical and density functional theory (DFT) analyses reveal that defect engineering significantly promotes the dual&#8208;pathway HzOR on Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work provides mechanistic understanding of HzOR electrocatalysis and highlights a general strategy for designing efficient, durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts.

         <title>Polyanion Electrointercalation Enables Termination&#8208;Tailored Oligolayer Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis in Alkali Chloroaluminate Melt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile non&#8208;destructive polyanion (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;) electrointercalation strategy was developed to synthesize facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx (T&#160;=&#160;&#8722;Cl, &#8722;NH, &#8722;Br). The as&#8208;delaminated oligolayer Ti3C2Clx sheets retained their pristine features of oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination, along with long cycling performance of 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 when serving as a coating material for Zn anode.








Abstract
Tailoring surface chemistry and achieving non&#8208;destructive interlayer exfoliation are crucial for controlling MXene properties. Conventional synthesis strategies typically involve damaging intercalation processes and yield MXenes with mixed surface terminations, compromising their functionality. Herein, we propose an anodic etching strategy to produce facilely delaminated, termination&#8208;tailored Ti3C2Tx from Ti3AlC2 in low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8208;NaCl&#8208;KCl) melts at 170&#160;&#176;C through the in situ electrochemical intercalation of polyanions (AlnCl3n+1&#8722;, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;1). Oligolayer Ti3C2Clx (MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx) was readily achieved via further gently exfoliating the etching product, preserving the original surface chemistry featuring oxygen depletion and uniform chlorine termination. As functional coatings, MSE&#8208;Ti3C2Clx significantly extended the cycling lifespan of Zn anodes to 5500&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to the tailored surface chemistry and oligolayer&#8208;induced ordered alignment that enabled efficient Zn2+ capture and uniform deposition. The strategy's versatility was also demonstrated by tailoring terminations (e.g., &#8722;Br, &#8722;NH) via molten salt composition engineering, providing a non&#8208;destructive pathway for MXene surface engineering and interlayer delamination, thereby unlocking their full potential for advanced energy applications.

         <title>Na2Fe3(SO4)4: A Zero&#8208;Strain Sustainable Positive Electrode Material for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sustainable zero&#8208;strain Na2Fe3(SO4)4 (NFS) positive electrode material is obtained by only ball&#8208;milling from cheap and available Na2SO4 and FeSO4. Iron coordination polyhedra include the Fe2O11 dimer of distorted octahedra (active during cycling) and FeO5 trigonal bipyramid, similar to that in the relative Pbca&#8208;Na2Mn3(SO4)4 (NMS). Unlike the Mn&#8208;based phase, NFS delivered 62 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with high&#8208;thick loaded electrodes at an average voltage of 3.34&#160;V versus Na+/Na.








Abstract
One of the challenges in the energy transition is minimization of the battery cost for energy grid storage. Na&#8208;ion batteries are a promising alternative to Li&#8208;based analogues thanks to low cost, abundance of constituents, and an already set&#8208;up industry. However, already commercialized positive electrode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries (Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and NaxCu1&#8208;y&#8208;zFeyMnzO2) contain critical raw elements such as V, Cu, and Mn, boosting the research towards abundant Fe&#8208;based materials. In this work, we report a novel sodium iron sulfate phase, Na2Fe3(SO4)4 (NFS), synthesized by ball milling, as a positive electrode material. This new compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group with cell parameters a = 9.682(1) &#197;, b = 8.739(1) &#197;, c = 29.300(4) &#197;, and V = 2479.0(5) &#197;3. Tests of thick NFS positive electrodes (18 mg cm&#8722;2) in Na&#8208;half coin cells delivered 62 mAh g&#8722;1 at C/30 (corresponding to the exchange of 2 e&#8208;) or 69% of the theoretical capacity (90 mAh g&#8722;1), with a good capacity retention of 47 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high discharge rate 2C. Operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) showed minimal (&lt;1%) changes in lattice parameters during cycling. Dominantly octahedra coordinated iron atoms are oxidized/reduced, as confirmed by operando synchrotron M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.

         <title>Alloying Small&#8208;Cation into Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Motif Gives Multiaxial Ferroelectrics with Enhanced Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a series of multiaxial bismuth&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics with organic mixed&#8208;cations, of which the most active candidate enables the photocurrent enhancement ratio reaches up to 4800%, far beyond those known ferroelectrics. This work affords a new avenue for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photoactive ferroelectrics have shown huge potentials for assembling high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices. Bismuth&#8208;based halides are emerging as a vigor ferroelectric subclass due to unique structural diversity and flexibility, while studies on their photo&#8208;ferroelectricity coupling remain extremely scarce. Here, we have alloyed organic mixed&#8208;cations into Bismuth&#8208;based prototype to design a series of new multiaxial ferroelectrics with strong photo&#8208;pyroelectricity, as notably exemplified by (BZA)2(DMA)BiBr6 (1, where BZA is benzylammounium; DMA is dimethylammounium). The dynamic motions of small DMA+ cation afford the driving force to trigger symmetry breaking of 3&#175;mFm$\bar 3m{\rm F}m $, thus giving its multiaxial ferroelectricity with 6 equivalent polarization directions. Strikingly, 1 exhibits photo&#8208;pyroelectricity in a broad ultraviolet&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral range (266&#8211;980&#160;nm), which couples with ferroelectric bulk photovoltaics to create giant photocurrent enhancement ratio of &#8764;4800%. This merit far surpasses those of known ferroelectric materials. These results shed light on the design of new photoactive ferroelectric candidates for smart photoelectronic device applications.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Graphene Nanoribbon via High&#8208;Pressure Topochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positioning sp3&#8208;CH and N atoms at specific sites can quasi&#8208;continuously tune the bandgap of [8]&#8208;AGNR. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization, we synthesized site&#8208;specific sp3&#8208;CH and N co&#8208;substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs and modified the bandgap precisely. Our work provides a general and controllable one&#8208;step synthesis method for producing various [8]&#8208;AGNRs with site&#8208;specific heteroatom substitution.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have attracted broad attention for their potential application in nanoelectronics. The electronic properties of the GNRs are closely related to their chemical structure like width, edge, terminating and hetero atoms, etc., and widely applied synthetic methods for the scalable synthesis of specific GNRs with atom&#8208;scale precision are urgently required. Here, we found that the stoichiometric and ordered positioning of N and sp3&#8208;CH in 8&#8208;armchair&#8208;GNR ([8]&#8208;AGNR) effectively modifies their bandgap in a large range of 0&#8211;2.85&#160;eV by theoretical calculations. Employing our recent&#8208;developed high&#8208;pressure topochemical dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder polymerization, three of these [8]&#8208;AGNRs were synthesized successfully in their bulk phase starting from crystalline dipyridinyl/dipyrimidinyl butadiynes, with the maximum nitrogen content of 27% in mass. The structures of these GNRs were demonstrated by spectroscopy, diffraction, transmission electron microscope, pair distribution function, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance methods. UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance spectra clearly evidenced the precise tuning of the electronic structures in these N and CH substituted [8]&#8208;AGNRs. Our work shows great versatility of this high&#8208;pressure topochemical synthetic strategy in synthesizing GNRs with site&#8208;specific N and sp3&#8208;CH substitutions. This strategy can also be applied to synthesizing more structure&#8208;specific carbon nano&#8208;materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Molecular Stabilization of Spacer Cation&#8208;Mediated Aging Dynamics in Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Precursors Enables Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unraveling spacer cation&#8208;mediated degradation in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, this work introduces 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB) as a dual&#8208;functional stabilizer. CFB stabilizer suppresses spacer cation degradation and coordinates multi&#8208;stage crystallization. The corresponding precursor delivers extended shelf life and devices achieve a record&#8208;low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV.








Abstract
The aging dynamics of perovskite precursor solutions critically govern the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, the underlying degradation mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors remain elusive, particularly regarding the pivotal role of spacer cations in modulating decomposition pathways. This study elucidates the intrinsic aging mechanisms in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite precursors, revealing that spacer cation integration fundamentally governs decomposition kinetics. A dual&#8208;functional solution stabilizer, 4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid (CFB), is strategically designed to concurrently mitigate precursor degradation and regulate crystallization dynamics. The carboxyl moiety undergoes spontaneous deprotonation to establish robust hydrogen bonds with guanidinium (GA+), effectively suppressing methylamine (MA0)&#8208;mediated nucleophilic attacks and preventing irreversible addition&#8208;elimination reactions between GA+ and MA0. Simultaneously, CFB orchestrates multi&#8208;stage crystallization control through coordination modulation, yielding highly oriented perovskite crystals with passivated grain boundaries. The optimized devices demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance with a remarkably low energy loss of 0.38&#160;eV. Notably, devices fabricated from aged precursors maintain 90% of initial efficiency over 42 days of ambient storage. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices deliver optimized humidity stability and thermal stability.

         <title>Solvent Chain&#8208;Length Engineering Enables All&#8208;Climate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte is designed by combining short&#8208;chain ethers for fast ion transport with long&#8208;chain glycol ethers to improve thermal and voltage stability, together with DOL and FEC additives. This strategy balances ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, thermal robustness, voltage tolerance, and low&#8208;temperature adaptability, enabling sodium&#8208;ion batteries with fast charging, long cycle life, and wide&#8208;temperature operation.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;rate capability, long&#8208;term cycling stability, high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains a challenge due to intrinsic solvent trade&#8208;offs. Here, we propose a molecular&#8208;scale electrolyte design strategy addressing this multi&#8208;objective optimization through solvent chain&#8208;length engineering. By coupling short&#8208;chain ethers (low&#8208;temperature kinetics) and long&#8208;chain glycol ethers (high&#8208;voltage/thermal stability) with 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), we construct a hybrid&#8208;solvent electrolyte that redefines Na&#8314; solvation chemistry. Systematic solvent&#8211;solvent interaction modulation weakens Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent binding to accelerate ion transport, while FEC&#8208;induced anion&#8208;rich coordination shells enhance interfacial stability. The hybrid electrolyte enables Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells to deliver an 82.75 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity after 9500 cycles at 10 C, sustain 600&#8208;day operation at 1 C, and function across &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C. Symmetric Na||Na cells demonstrate stable cycling for over one year. Moreover, the electrolyte exhibits good compatibility with various commercial cathode materials within a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8211;4.5&#160;V and demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature adaptability in full&#8208;cell systems. This work demonstrates solvent chain&#8208;length&#8208;driven solvation engineering as a viable strategy to concurrently address kinetic, thermodynamic, and interfacial challenges, offering a practical pathway toward all&#8208;climate SIBs with balanced multi&#8208;performance metrics.

         <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Silyl&#8208; and Boraformylations: Charting a Challenging Road Ahead</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights advances in silyl&#8208; and boraformylation&#8212;CHO and silyl/boryl additions to unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds. While silylformylation has matured, boraformylation remains early&#8208;stage. Enantioselective variants are still elusive, offering key opportunities to develop catalysts for accessing stereochemically complex molecules. 








Abstract
This minireview highlights key milestone discoveries in (stereoselective) silylformylation and boraformylation reactions&#8212;formal additions of a formyl group (CHO) and a silyl or boryl group across unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds, such as those in alkenes, dienes, alkynes, or allene derivatives. Although these transformations have not yet reached the level of maturity of the parent hydroformylation reaction (the addition of CHO and H across an unsaturated C&#9472;C bond), significant progress has nonetheless been achieved. This minireview presents the current state of the art in silylformylation catalysis, emphasizing the chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities achieved by leading catalytic systems. In contrast, boraformylation remains in its infancy, with only a handful of examples reported in the literature to date. Notably, catalytic enantioselective variants of both silyl&#8208; and boraformylation reactions have yet to be realized. This limited progress is primarily attributed to the scarcity of catalysts that effectively combine a metal center with a suitable ligand framework. This minireview article underscores the significant opportunities for advancing catalytic enantioselective methodologies in these areas and the potential for accessing structurally diverse, stereochemically complex molecules through these underdeveloped yet promising transformations.

         <title>Enhanced Bifunctional Catalysis of Iridium Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Holey Carbon via Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the successful synthesis of Ir nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;doped holey carbon (NHC) as a high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Strong metal&#8211;support interactions between Ir and NHC effectively control the size and electronic structure of the Ir nanoparticles, leading to superior catalytic activity compared to commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts.








Abstract
Developing efficient and durable catalysts is crucial for the practical application of energy storage and conversion technologies. This work reports the synthesis of iridium nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped holey carbon (Ir&#8208;NHC), which exhibit outstanding performance in both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), leading to impressive device performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Compared to commercial Pt/C&#160;+&#160;Ir/C, Ir&#8208;NHC demonstrates a 1.6&#8208;fold higher specific capacity (862.5 mAh g&#8722;1 versus 536.9 mAh g&#8722;1), a similar power density of 120.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, and remarkable cycling stability (2000 cycles versus &#8764;32 cycles). A series of X&#8208;ray&#8208;based spectroscopic characterizations reveal a strong metal&#8211;support interaction between the Ir nanoparticles and the NHC support. This interaction enables precise control over the size and electronic structure of the Ir nanoparticles. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure studies conducted at various OER potentials demonstrate that the electronic structure of Ir and the adsorption process of OER intermediates are optimized by this interaction, leading to the observed excellent catalytic activity and stability of Ir&#8208;NHC.

         <title>Polymeric Diaminophenazine with Spiral Architecture as Cathode Materials for Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a spiral&#8208;structured polymer, poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) (p&#8208;DAP), with alternating aromatic/alicyclic rings. Its interlayer curvature and electronic delocalization synergistically enable fast charge transport, yielding superior energy storage in aqueous Znic&#8208;organic batteries at both ambient and low temperatures.








Abstract
Pyrazine&#8208;based organic electrode materials hold great promise for applications in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), while developing cost&#8208;effective organic molecules that exhibit both high electrochemical activity and long cycle life remains challenging. Herein, we report an&#160;organic polymer (p&#8208;DAP) featuring alternating rigid&#8208;flexible spiral structures for AZIBs. Synthesized from cost&#8208;effective o&#8208;phenylenediamine via thermal polymerization, p&#8208;DAP integrates saturated alicyclic rings and pyrazine moieties to stabilize interlayer spacing and facilitate ion transport. The polymer achieves nearly 95% redox&#8208;active sites utilization at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, delivering 145.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 78.9%&#160;over 136 900 cycles. Notably, it maintains a capacity retention of 97.7% after 3550 cycles at &#8211;40&#160;&#176;C. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal a proton&#8208;dominated charge storage mechanism. This work offers a promising strategy for designing durable organic electrodes for high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Molecular Weight Control in Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) of gradient thermoplastics with varying levels of control derived from both linear and nonlinear (spiral) fronts. 








Abstract
In this study, we push the limits of bulk frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) to control polymer molecular weight and dispersity without the need for solvents, deoxygenation, or post&#8208;polymerization purification. By tuning inhibitor loadings and introducing inhibitory comonomers, we enable enhanced control over molecular weight (39&#8211;700&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) and achieve dispersity as low as &#208; = 1.07, surpassing previous limitations while preserving the thermal properties of the materials. This increased inhibition also leads to the first demonstration of closed&#8208;mold, nonlinear propagation modes (i.e., spin modes) in FROMP of norbornene&#8208;type monomers, where the reaction front spirals down the tube, revealing the intricate interplay between thermal transport, reaction kinetics, and gravitational effects. Furthermore, we constructed materials with gradient compositions and spatially defined variations in molecular weight, dispersity, composition, and patterning. These advances position controlled FROMP as a powerful tool for rapid, scalable, and self&#8208;regulating material design, merging the fields of controlled polymerization and self&#8208;propagating material manufacturing.

         <title>Can Charge Transfer Across C&#9472;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize Oil Droplets in Water?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer of electron density from water to oil and accompanying dynamic polarization has been suggested to explain stability of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions. Energy decomposition analysis at the water&#8211;hexane interface shows that forward and backward charge transfer nearly cancel, yielding a negligible interfacial charge density inconsistent with emulsion stability and conductivity needed for electrophoretic mobility.








Abstract
Oil&#8211;water emulsions resist aggregation due to the presence of negative charges at their surface that leads to mutual repulsion between droplets, but the molecular origin of oil charge is currently under debate. Although much evidence has suggested that ionic species must accumulate at the interface, an alternative perspective attributes the negative charge on the oil droplet to charge transfer of electron density from water to oil molecules. Although the charge transfer mechanism is consistent with the correct sign of oil charge, it is just as important to provide good estimates of the charge magnitude to explain emulsion stability and electrophoresis experiments. Here, we show using energy decomposition analysis that the amount of net flow of charge from water to oil is negligibly small due to nearly equal forward and backward charge transfer through weak oil&#8211;water interactions, such that oil droplets would be unstable and coalesce, contrary to experiment. The lack of charge transfer also explains why vibrational sum frequency scattering reports a blue shift in the oil C&#8211;H frequency when forming emulsions with water, which arises from Pauli repulsion due to localized confinement at the interface. Finally, unlike ions, neither charge transfer nor dynamic polarization can produce a finite conductivity needed to couple to electric fields that would explain electrophoretic&#160;mobility.

         <title>Impact of Glycoclustering on Stiffening of MUC5AC Peptides Revealed by High&#8208;Efficiency Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides featuring a previously unattained degree of glycoclustering were obtained by fully automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis in 1,3&#8208;dioxolane/Tween&#8208;20 and diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligation. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) measurements of densely GalNAcylated MUC5AC multi&#8208;tandem repeat peptides provided insights into the correlation between the occupancy of O&#8208;glycosylation sites and stiffening of the peptide backbone.








Abstract
Clustered O&#8208;glycosylation of long tandem repeat regions is the hallmark of secreted mucins such as MUC5AC. Glycosylation is thought to play a key role in rigidifying the peptide backbone. The synthesis of peptides containing extended O&#8208;glycosylation clusters has proven challenging, thus limiting studies on the influence of glycoclustering on peptide structure. Here, we report an efficient glyco&#8208;economic synthesis of peptides featuring a previously unattained degree of glycoclustering. The method is based on a fully automated, DMF&#8208;free solid&#8208;phase synthesis employing the solvent 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) in all steps. The addition of Tween&#8208;20 enabled fast couplings of and to GalNAcylated amino acids by using only 0.5 excess equivalents at room temperature. Five tandem repeats long MUC5AC glycopeptides containing up to 30 GalNAc residues (100% occupancy of potential glycosylation sites) were accessed by Diselenide&#8211;Selenoester Ligation and selective deselenization in the presence of terminal cysteine residues. Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements showed that progressive GalNAcylation shifts the conformational equilibrium from the random coil to the extended polyproline type II helix conformation. Pulsed Electron&#8211;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy measurements revealed a significant stiffening of the MUC5AC peptide backbone upon GalNAcylation of four or six amino acids in each octad repeat.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Optimized Film&#8208;Forming Processes Lead to Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Modules Fabricated with Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the extended nucleation and crystal growth time by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20&#8208;based organic solar cells (0.0476&#160;cm2) and modules (19.44&#160;cm2) processed from m&#8208;xylene achieve high efficiencies of 19.04% and 16.71%, respectively.








Abstract
While the transition from halogenated to eco&#8208;friendly processing solvents is vital for the industrialization of organic solar cells (OSCs), obtaining ideal morphology of active layer during green fabrication of the device remains a challenge. To address this issue, the famous polymer donor of PM6 is chemically modified through the introduction of 20% chlorinated dithiazole (Tz2Cl) segment into the mainchain. It is found that, the obtained terpolymer, PM6&#8208;ClTz20, shows the improved solubility in the non&#8208;halogenated solvent of m&#8208;xylene. More importantly, Tz2Cl units induce the enlarged electrostatic potential difference between PM6&#8208;ClTz20 and the acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9, giving donor&#8211;acceptor electrostatic attraction. This prolongs the nucleation and crystal growth time of donor and acceptor in m&#8208;xylene solution, endowing the blend film with fine phase&#8208;separated domains and bigger crystal size. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;ClTz20:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary system yields outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.04% and 16.71% for the small&#8208;area device (0.0476&#160;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (19.44&#160;cm2), respectively. This work clarifies the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interaction in regulating the film&#8208;forming process and optimizing blend morphology, providing a feasible route to sustainable and scalable OSCs.

         <title>Partitioning COF Membrane Channels into Ultramicroporous and &#960;&#8208;Electron&#8208;Rich Compartments for Multicomponent Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel partition has been achieved in two novel alkynyl COF membranes by using click chemistry, which results in an ultramicroporous configuration as well as concentrated charge distribution. The resultant COF membranes are capable of efficiently separating multi&#8208;cation mixtures and multi&#8208;anion mixtures.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) build a versatile platform for constructing separation membranes, affording them disruptive candidates for nanoscale molecule/ion sieving. However, the reported aperture of COFs mainly concentrates on 0.8&#8211;10.0&#160;nm, leaving a daunting challenge in fabrication of ultramicroporous (&lt;0.7&#160;nm) COF membranes. Herein, the channel partition of COF membranes is elaborately implemented by taking advantage of the copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) based on click chemistry. Two kinds of novel alkynyl COF membranes bearing symmetric alkynyl monomers are predesigned and synthesized. The alkynyl groups can react with dual&#8208;azide molecules to form triazole ring bridge, which allows the partition of hexagonal or tetragonal channels. Moreover, the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich structures of triazole ring offer cation&#8208;philic or anion&#8208;repulsive region, showing great potentials in precise ion separations. Consequently, the superior performance is obtained in separating ternary/binary ion mixtures: Li+/Mg2+/(K+) and F&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/(Cl&#8722;). Example of dealing with a K+/Li+/Mg2+ ternary mixture, the optimum p&#8208;TpPa&#8208;C&#8801;CH membrane exhibits an actual selectivity of 101.2 for K+/Mg2+ and 30.9 for Li+/Mg2+. The strong adaptability and wide range of application scenarios of our COF membranes exceed the ever&#8208;reported membranes. This work provides a fundamental to comprehending the channel manipulation mechanisms and advances the development of high&#8208;performance ion separation membranes.

         <title>Multidentate Macrocyclic Salphen&#8208;Based 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework with abundant accessible metal sites has been synthesized by coordination of a Salphen macrocycle with Cu2+ ions. The resulting SM&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu shows an exceptional performance as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.6% for ethylene production at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under a continuous pure acetylene feed.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous materials with promising electrochemical applications. The design of novel organic ligands for constructing 2D c&#8208;MOFs remains a crucial research frontier. While the incorporation of macrocycle blocks into 2D c&#8208;MOFs can introduce intrinsic cavities with advantageous properties, most existing reports are limited to coordinating with only one equivalent metal ion per macrocyclic cavity. In this work, we developed a triangular&#8208;shaped Salphen macrocycle&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF (SM&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu) featuring multidentate internal coordination sites. SM&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu exhibits high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and abundant accessible metal sites. Remarkably, this material demonstrates exceptional performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene (E&#8208;HAE), achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 96.6% for ethylene production at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under continuous pure acetylene feed. This study not only broadens the family of macrocycle&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOFs but also provides new insights into their potential for advanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Catalytic Strategies for Stereoselective Carbohydrate Synthesis: Emerging Concepts for Accessing Challenging Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent developments in catalytic stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis are presented. The converging synthetic trajectories of the catalytic and carbohydrate communities are discussed, including impactful case studies exemplifying noncovalent catalysis, radical catalysis, asymmetric catalysis and new catalytic modalities.








Abstract
The development of innovative catalytic strategies for stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis is rapidly emerging as a theme of general synthetic interest. This research frontier is fuelled by current realization that anomeric and site&#8208;selectivity challenges encountered in carbohydrate chemistry are indeed fascinating fundamental synthetic questions, still yet to be satisfactorily addressed. Although specialist carbohydrate chemistry and catalysis developed largely independently over the past three decades, growing recognition of carbohydrates as an excellent platform for catalytic method development is now generating fresh opportunities to advance our understanding of chemical phenomena. Unexpected catalytic mechanisms are often unearthed in such cross&#8208;disciplinary endeavours. Moreover, new bond&#8208;forming catalytic solutions are in great demand as the definition of biologically relevant glycosidic chemical space has broadened substantially beyond native oligosaccharides to include glycomimetics, rare and non&#8208;classical sugars. Distinctly, the last 5 years is marked by an unprecedented flurry of activity in the development of ground&#8208;breaking catalytic carbohydrate transformations, leading to robust methods that diverge from classical glycosylation approaches. In this minireview, lately emerging concepts such as noncovalent catalyzed glycosylations, radical catalyzed glycosylations, asymmetric catalytic carbohydrate functionalizations and new glycosylation modalities will be examined.

A wet&#8208;chemistry synthetic protocol is developed for the creation of rare earth (RE) confined high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;RE) nanocrystals (NCs) with rich surface cavities and lattice distortions via a general high&#8208;entropy (HE)&#8208;induced confinement strategy, featuring atomically dispersed RE confined in HE Pt&#8208;based frameworks. These HEA&#8208;RE NCs serve as multi&#8208;synergistic catalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction, demonstrating the multiple proton&#8208; and electron&#8208;coupled complex reactions. 








Abstract
Rare earth (RE) elements with unique lanthanide contraction and electron configuration are promising for many important studies. Alloying RE with typical 3d/5d transition metals generates new or improved properties due to enhanced orbital coupling and thermodynamic stability. However, limited to ultralow reduction potential, strong oxophilicity and poor compatibility of RE, most research focused on high&#8208;temperature procedures and complex processing techniques, which hinders compositional and structural control, functional optimization and mechanistic investigation for diverse applications. Here we define a general wet&#8208;chemistry synthetic protocol for the creation of RE&#8208;confined high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;RE) nanocrystals (NCs) under mild conditions, featuring atomically dispersed RE embedded in Pt&#8208;based HEA framework, via sequential reduction kinetics of different metal precursors and high&#8208;entropy effect&#8208;induced confinement of RE atoms. The HEA&#8208;RE NCs with multi&#8208;site synergy switch from boosting simple reaction to complex process involving multiple reactants and intermediates. They achieve &#8764;99% Faradaic efficiency and superior yield rate toward nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction, attributed to carved surface promoting mass transfer, tensile strain tuning adsorbate behavior, and delocalized RE electron regulating reaction pathways. Our study provides a new perspective for rational design and potential application of RE&#8208;based HEA nanostructures with atomic precision.

         <title>Breaking the Linear Scaling Relations for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction with a Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst Composed of a MnFe&#8208;Porphyrrole Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired MnFe porphyrrole aerogel catalyst is synthesized using a covalent 3D framework with adjacent metal centers. The bimetallic structure enhances ORR activity through Mn&#9472;Fe synergy and high active site density. Fuel cell tests show over a 30% increase in peak power density, with DFT calculations confirming metal&#8211;metal charge transfer as the source of improved performance.








Abstract
Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced catalytic performance through synergistic interactions between the two metals, allowing them to break the linear scaling relations and reach high electrocatalytic activity. This study presents bimetallic aerogel&#8208;based catalyst synthesized as a covalent, three&#8208;dimensional framework containing neighboring iron and manganese sites. The aerogel structure provides a high surface area and porosity, facilitating an ultra&#8208;high active site density and efficient mass transport. The MnFe porphyrrole's unique structure is obtained by alternately linking Mn&#8208;porphyrin and Fe&#8208;corrole complexes. It exhibited outstanding performance with an onset potential of 0.99 VRHE. Comparative studies with a free&#8208;base Fe porphyrrole catalyst (Eonset 0.97 VRHE) revealed that while Mn incorporation led to only a slight improvement in half&#8208;cell performance, it resulted in significantly enhanced performance in anion exchange membrane fuel cell. The MnFe catalyst achieved an OCV of 0.97&#160;V and a peak power density of 0.27&#160;W cm&#8722;2, outperforming the free&#8208;base Fe counterpart. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the higher ORR activity of MnFe&#8208;porphyrrole is due to charge transfer between Mn and Fe atoms, which is absent in the reference free&#8208;base Fe&#8208;porphyrrole. These findings underscore the advantages of bimetallic catalysts in improving ORR activity and fuel cell efficiency by leveraging synergistic effects.

         <title>From Light to Cure: Precision Phototherapies for Antibiotic&#8208;Refractory Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms, formidable barriers to antimicrobial resistance, are prime targets for phototherapies: PTT (local hyperthermia) and PDT (ROS generation). This review examines these approaches and their combinatorial strategies, addressing clinical translation challenges and advancing antibiotic&#8208;independent infection management.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms serve as formidable barriers in antimicrobial therapy and are central to the emergence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance. Their compact extracellular polymeric matrix, metabolic heterogeneity, and quorum&#8208;sensing&#8211;mediated resistance gene expression collectively endow biofilms with exceptional defense against conventional antibiotics. This review highlights the structural&#8208;functional complexity of biofilms and focuses on emerging phototherapeutic strategies&#8212;photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8212;as promising biofilm&#8208;targeted approaches. PTT employs near&#8208;infrared light to induce localized hyperthermia, disrupting bacterial membranes and enhancing drug penetration. PDT generates reactive oxygen species via photoactivated photosensitizers, leading to oxidative destruction of both cells and extracellular polymeric substances. These strategies offer metabolic independence, precise spatiotemporal control, and efficacy against dormant pathogens. Recent advances in smart nanoplatforms enable the integration of PTT/PDT with responsive drug delivery, imaging guidance, and immune modulation, achieving multimodal, precision antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, synergistic combinations with enzymatic degradation, immune intervention, and antibiotics show promise in treating chronic and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. We conclude by outlining translational challenges and strategic directions for clinical application, underscoring the potential of phototherapy to reshape infection management beyond antibiotic dependence.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Bridged Compact Interfacial Shielding for Practical Seawater Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte is designed using natural seawater solvent and a host&#8211;guest complex additive. The MBT guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the CD host dominated by aqueous solubility. Cl&#8722; facilitates a compact MBT shield on the Zn anode surface via bridging effect, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion.








Abstract
Substituting natural seawater (NS) for deionized water significantly reduces the electrolyte manufacturing cost of aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries, but it also poses severe corrosion challenges to the Zn metal anode, given the presence of the Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;rich Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Here, a NS electrolyte featuring NS solvent and the host&#8211;guest complex additive is designed. The 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) guest shows sustained&#8208;release behavior from the cyclodextrin host dominated by its aqueous solubility in the NS electrolyte. Crucially, Cl&#8722; ions facilitate a compact MBT shield at the interface via bridging effects, creating a Cl&#8722;/H2O&#8208;poor microenvironment that suppresses corrosion and extends Zn anode cycle life. Thus, the Zn anode achieves an extended cycling life of 400&#160;h in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell even under a practical depth of discharge of 42.7%. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.92 exhibits 99% capacity retention at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles, and the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with an initial discharge capacity of 1.21 Ah maintains stable cycling for 50 cycles.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of the Formation of Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes in Liposome&#8208;Based Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic ion transporters enable precise control over carboxylate transport across liposome membranes that are preloaded with Ln3+ ions. This process triggers the spatiotemporal formation of luminescent lanthanide complexes within liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors. Cryo&#8208;TEM and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveal that the complexation of lanthanides induces a structural transformation of liposomes from unilamellar to bilamellar vesicles. 








Abstract
The controlled mass transfer across compartmentalised environments in synthetic nanoreactors is essential for enhancing precise spatiotemporal manipulation of chemical transformations within confined spaces. In this study, we present a strategy that integrates a synthetic anion transporter in liposome&#8208;based nanoreactors, allowing for spatiotemporal control over the formation of metal&#8211;organic complexes in liposomes. This approach enables us to effectively modulate the assembly of luminescent lanthanide&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate nanostructures. Fluorescence studies demonstrate that the reaction rate can be customised by varying the anion transporter concentration, which dictates the rate of entry of the carboxylate ligand. Changes in the morphology of the liposome nanoreactors due to the assisted transmembrane transport of benzenedicarboxylate were investigated using cryo&#8208;TEM and time&#8208;resolved SAXS measurements, which revealed a structural transformation of the lipid bilayer during the complex formation. Our findings provide a novel platform for exploring coordination chemistry in nanoscale confinements, opening avenues for the design of biohybrid materials.

         <title>Fully&#8208;Functionalized Natural Product Probes to Expand the Chemical Tractability of the Human Proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit the inherent structural complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a unique library of photoaffinity (PA) probes, which we term fully functionalized natural products (FFNPs). Using mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemical proteomics, we uncover hundreds of topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective interactions with functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes in live cells. This work supports the potential of FFNPs to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.








Abstract
Photoaffinity (PA)&#8208;based chemoproteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means for proteome&#8208;wide mapping of ligandable proteins directly in cells, as well as the concatenated discovery of small molecule chemical probes. However, due to the relatively low throughput of screening small molecule libraries by proteomics and the synthetic burden incurred in installing the requisite photoactivatable functionality on each member, great priority must be placed on library design to maximize efficient exploration of biologically relevant chemical space and to ensure the identification of authentic binding interactions. To address this challenge, here we leverage the inherent complexity of natural products (NPs) to access a structurally unique series of diastereo/regioisomeric PA probes for ligand discovery in cells. Through semi&#8208;synthesis, we exploit sp3&#8208;rich NP scaffolds and employ mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based chemoproteomics to identify and quantify their interactions in human cells, uncovering topology, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective ligands for functionally diverse proteins that currently lack reported chemical probes. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential of NP&#8208;inspired chemoproteomic libraries to expand the boundaries of the ligandable proteome.

         <title>Breaking the Performance Limit of Pure Metals for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional NRR electrocatalysts suffer from low N2 concentration and competitive H2O/*H adsorption. This study proposes three&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized hollow fiber electrodes to boost NRR by elevating local N2 concentration, thereby modulating *N2 and *H coverage. The strategy demonstrates broad applicability across various metal catalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ambient&#8208;condition ammonia synthesis, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the low N2 concentration in aqueous systems and the competing strong adsorption of H2O/H intermediates on conventional bulk metal catalysts. Herein, we propose a universal micro/nanoengineering strategy to address these challenges by constructing three&#8208;phase&#8208;interface&#8208;optimized hollow fiber (HF) electrodes. This design simultaneously enhances local N2 enrichment and modulates the surface coverage of critical intermediates (*N2 versus *H), thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium toward NRR. As a proof of concept, Fe&#8208;based HF electrodes achieve a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 27.1&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 3.5% under ambient conditions&#8212;values dramatically enhanced by &#8764;60&#8208;fold and &#8764;35&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to planar Fe electrodes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hierarchical porous architecture of HF electrodes promotes N2 diffusion and alters the adsorption hierarchy of intermediates, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution while activating N&#8801;N bond cleavage. Crucially, this strategy demonstrates broad applicability, as evidenced by significantly improved NRR performance across diverse metals (e.g., Cu, Ni), highlighting its potential as a general platform for advancing sustainable ammonia electrosynthesis.

         <title>Reversible Mechanical Interlocking via Stimuli&#8208;Triggered Nonhomeomorphic Topology Transformation Enables Highly Efficient Rotaxane Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design the macrocycles capable of stimuli&#8208;triggered, reversible transformation between nonhomeomorphic topologies (one&#8208;hole ring versus two&#8208;hole figure&#8208;eight ring). By leveraging the ring size change associated with the topology transformation, we achieve reagent&#8208;free, highly efficient, reversible, and one&#8208;pot synthesis of [2]rotaxane and bis[2]rotaxanes. This strategy simultaneously enables convenient, efficient, and functional rotaxane construction, providing new insight into the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and the design of thermally or photochemically gated units in molecular machines.








Abstract
Rotaxanes, as one of the most fundamental mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have attracted considerable attention in many fields. However, a method that reconciles convenient, efficient, and &#8220;high&#8208;value&#8208;added&#8221; (such as reversibility, higher&#8208;order structures, and diverse topologies) synthesis of rotaxanes, remains challenging. Here, we report a threading&#8208;and&#8208;shrinking strategy to quantitatively prepare [2]rotaxane and bis[2]rotaxane (higher than 99% conversion and 92% isolated yield for [2]rotaxane; 96% conversion, 80% isolated yield for bis[2]rotaxane). The rotaxanes with a chair&#8208;like and an orthogonal geometry were synthesized in one pot by 365&#160;nm UV light irradiation via shrinkage of macrocycle driven by reversible topology transformation between nonhomeomorphic structures, requiring no extra addition of reagents like stoppers and catalysts. The heat&#8208;triggered reverse topology transformation quantitatively converts the chair&#8208;like rotaxanes into pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes to achieve mechanical unlocking. In contrast, rotaxanes with an orthogonal geometry exhibit thermal stability and remain mechanically interlocked upon heating.

         <title>Development of Indolo&#8208;Bicyclo[3.1.1]Heptane as a Carbazole Isostere Through Radical Indolization of Bicyclo[1.1.0]Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of two functional groups&#8212;isonitrile and alkene&#8212;into the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been successfully developed. This reaction offers a direct and efficient synthesis of indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a promising carbazole isostere, with high bond&#8208;forming efficiency and a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies indicate that triplet energy transfer plays a pivotal role as a key step.








Abstract
Semisaturated ring systems with a balanced fraction of C(sp3) have garnered increasing attention in drug development. In this study, we propose indolo&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane as a potential carbazole isostere and present a novel strategy for synthesizing this new semisaturated polycyclic scaffold. The synthesis involves using bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as radical precursors/terminators in the Fukuyama radical indolization reaction with 2&#8208;alkenylarylisocyanides, providing a highly efficient approach to construct a tricyclic system in a single step. These reactions represent a rare example of two functional groups (isonitrile and alkene) being sequentially involved in the cyclization process within BCB chemistry.

         <title>Switching Enantioselectivity in Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase for the Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Deficient Aromatic d&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs) were engineered to switch enantioselectivity, enabling hydroamination for the direct synthesis of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AA). Structure&#8208;guided engineering provided PAL variants with broad substrate scope, high activity, and excellent d&#8208;selectivity, broadening the utility of PALs in asymmetric synthesis.








Abstract
Aromatic d&#8208;amino acids (d&#8208;AAs) are valuable building blocks in drug discovery and peptide therapeutics, yet their direct and efficient biocatalytic synthesis remains a challenge. Here, we report the rational engineering of phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Planctomyces brasiliensis (PbPAL) to enable asymmetric hydroamination for the enantioselective synthesis of d&#8208;aromatic amino acids. By targeting active&#8208;site residue L205, we identified variants capable of highly d&#8208;enantioselective hydroamination, with L205F enabling the transformation of electron&#8208;deficient aryl acrylates with &gt;99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The synthetic utility of this platform was demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis of d&#8208;benzoxazole and substituted 2&#8208;pyridylalanines. Structural and mutational studies revealed distinct roles for the 4&#8208;methylideneimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;one (MIO) prosthetic group and active&#8208;site residues L205, Y64, and K397 in modulating enantioselectivity. These results enabled the identification of PbPAL variants with the opposite selectivity, such as L205V&#8208;K397A, which preferentially produce l&#8208;amino acids. This work broadens the utility of PALs as programmable biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Aromatic &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-amino acids (&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-AAs) are valuable building blocks in drug discovery and peptide therapeutics, yet their direct and efficient biocatalytic synthesis remains a challenge. Here, we report the rational engineering of phenylalanine ammonia lyase from &lt;i&gt;Planctomyces brasiliensis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pb&lt;/i&gt;PAL) to enable asymmetric hydroamination for the enantioselective synthesis of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aromatic amino acids. By targeting active-site residue L205, we identified variants capable of highly &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-enantioselective hydroamination, with L205F enabling the transformation of electron-deficient aryl acrylates with &amp;gt;99% enantiomeric excess (&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The synthetic utility of this platform was demonstrated by gram-scale synthesis of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-benzoxazole and substituted 2-pyridylalanines. Structural and mutational studies revealed distinct roles for the 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO) prosthetic group and active-site residues L205, Y64, and K397 in modulating enantioselectivity. These results enabled the identification of &lt;i&gt;Pb&lt;/i&gt;PAL variants with the opposite selectivity, such as L205V-K397A, which preferentially produce &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-amino acids. This work broadens the utility of PALs as programmable biocatalysts for asymmetric synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Isolation, and Reactivity of a Phosphinidene Telluride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the synthesis and isolation of a phosphinidene telluride. This species acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer reagent accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium.








Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphorus(III) telluride is reported. The compound was accessed by means of a double bond metathesis reaction between an amido&#8208;functionalized phosphinidene oxide, BnArNP&#9552;O (Ar&#160;=&#160;bulky aryl substituent), with a silylene telluride, L(NMe2)Si&#9552;Te (L&#160;=&#160;PhC(NtBu)2). The resulting phosphinidene telluride, BnArNP&#9552;Te, exhibits a short P&#9552;Te bond (2.297(1) &#197;), resulting from a significant p&#960;&#8211;p&#960; orbital interaction between the phosphorus(III) and tellurium(&#8722;II) atoms. Key to the stabilization of this compound is the amido substituent associated with the phosphorus atom, which provides kinetic stabilization due to its steric bulk but also significant thermodynamic stabilization through negative hyperconjugation of the nitrogen atom lone pair into antibonding orbital interactions between phosphorus and tellurium. The title compound acts as a versatile phosphinidene transfer platform, accompanied by the extrusion of elemental tellurium to afford other phosphorus(III) compounds via transient phosphorus(V) intermediates.

         <title>Probing the Structural Dynamics of In2O3 Using in Situ Raman Spectroscopy: Bridging Material Dynamics and Sensor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 (cubic/rhombohedral) homojunctions are designed for room&#8208;temperature NO2 sensing, achieving am ultrahigh response (1208 to 5&#160;ppm). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals reversible phase transitions, identifying rhombohedral In2O3 as the dominant active phase for NO2 interaction. This real&#8208;time structural analysis directly correlates phase dynamics with sensor response, resolving a key uncertainty in MOS sensing mechanisms. 








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors still face the critical challenge of high operating temperatures. While material engineering strategies have enabled room&#8208;temperature operation, the dynamic evolution of active phases during sensing&#8212;a key factor governing structure&#8208;activity relationships&#8212;remains poorly understood due to the lack of real&#8208;time characterization techniques. Here, we design phase&#8208;engineered In2O3 homojunctions (cubic/rhombohedral) via graphene&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis and demonstrate their exceptional NO2 sensing performance at room temperature. The optimized In2O3/graphene (In2O3/G) hybrid exhibits a 20&#8208;fold enhancement in response (1208 versus 58 for pure In2O3 at 5&#160;ppm NO2), achieving ultrahigh sensitivity with minimal power consumption. By employing in situ Raman spectroscopy to probe structural dynamics during gas exposure, we identify a reversible phase transition between cubic and rhombohedral In2O3, with the rhombohedral phase acting as the dominant active site for NO2 adsorption/desorption. This real&#8208;time observation of phase&#8208;dependent reactivity establishes a direct correlation between transient structural changes and sensor response, resolving a long&#8208;standing ambiguity in MOS&#8208;based sensing mechanisms. Our findings not only pinpoint the active phase but also provide a generalizable methodology to bridge nanoscale material dynamics with macroscopic device functionality, paving the way for rational design of high&#8208;performance sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoconjugates with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission for Near&#8208;Infrared II Imaging and Transcytosis&#8208;Driven Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional drug conjugate, OPGAX, was developed for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and tumor&#8208;penetrative therapy. OPGAX self&#8208;assembles into uniform nanoparticles, enhancing NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission through its AIE property. After intravenous administration, OPGAX shows prolonged blood circulation, efficient tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration via transcytosis for improved cancer therapy, and the ability to visualize whole&#8208;body vasculature and track tumor penetration dynamically.








Abstract
Nanomedicine holds immense potential to revolutionize cancer therapy, yet its clinical translation remains hampered by insufficient tumor accumulation and an inability to dynamically monitor therapeutic penetration. While transcytosis&#8208;mediated transport offers a promising strategy to overcome biological barriers, existing carriers lack real&#8208;time imaging capabilities, particularly in the near&#8208;infrared II window, to guide optimization. Herein, we address this dual challenge through a multifunctional poly[L&#8208;&#947;&#8208;[2&#8208;(N&#8208;oxide&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylamino)ethyl]glutamine]&#8208;paclitaxel (OPGAX) conjugate integrated with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens. The OPGAX conjugate self&#8208;assembled into uniform nanoparticles (NPs) with a high drug&#8208;loading capacity (42.5%) and intense near&#8208;Infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm). The zwitterionic tertiary amine oxide (TAO) moiety endowed OPGAX with protein resistance and cell membrane affinity, leading to prolonged blood circulation and enhanced tumor accumulation. OPGAX NPs performed NIR&#8208;II imaging to visualize whole&#8208;body vasculature and dynamically track tumor penetration. In 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, OPGAX NPs achieved deep tumor infiltration via transcytosis, visualized dynamically by NIR&#8208;II imaging, and suppressed tumor growth. This platform bridges diagnostic certainty with therapeutic efficacy, offering a translatable strategy for image&#8208;guided precision oncology.

         <title>Steering Amide Synthesis from Acetonitrile by Electrochemically Derived Active Superoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectively formed in situ superoxide radicals, &#8226;&#9472;O2&#8722; via oxygen electroreduction are highly active for amide bond formation to synthesize acetamide from acetonitrile with 94% selectivity under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Amides with unique carbonyl&#8208;nitrogen linkage are fundamental functional groups that are active and essential for a wide range of natural and synthetic products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and key intermediates. Amide bond formation is one of the most fundamental reactions in chemistry. Conventional amide synthesis faces challenges of poor atom economy and reliance on hazardous reagents. Herein, we present a tandem electro&#8208;thermal catalytic pathway for the synthesis of acetamide from acetonitrile, leveraging electrochemically generated superoxide radicals to steer oxygen insertion under ambient conditions. The superoxide radicals were formed via controlled electroreduction of molecular oxygen. In 1&#160;M K2CO3 electrolyte containing methanol, we achieved over 94% selectivity toward acetamide at a total current density up to 104&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a productivity of 878&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Mechanistic studies reveal that the superoxide radicals stabilized by a buffered alkaline environment facilitated the nucleophilic C&#9472;O coupling at the nitrile group, while the presence of methanol quenched the hydroxyl radicals and effectively suppressed the over&#8208;oxidation of acetamide to acetate. This coupled electro&#8208;thermal catalysis enables the synthesis of a large variety of amides and may inspire more complex organic synthesis through active oxygen species&#8208;mediated process.

         <title>Strengthening Intermediate Adsorption on a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Assembly by Polymeric Modification for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction into Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) modification of cobalt phthalocyanine nanotubes boosts electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol by 14&#8208;fold enhancement of turnover frequency. The pyridyl groups axially coordinate to cobalt centers, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediate to decreased the reaction barrier.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) to generate value added methanol (MeOH) in water has been considered as a potential strategy to realize efficient carbon cycle and reutilization. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) represents as a classical molecular catalyst carrying precisely tunable active sites, which has been widely explored for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;MeOH conversion, but optimization of performance is suffering from relatively easiness in desorption of *CO intermediate. To this end, we developed a novel molecular assembly of CoPc nanotubes (CoT) driven by van der Waals force with surface being modified by poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine). The as&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited an exceptional performance of MeOH production for the turnover frequency enhanced by more than 14&#8208;fold compared to the pristine CoT, and the Faradaic efficiency is up to 40% at a moderate potential. It revealed that the pyridyl groups of P4VP axially coordinated with the Co catalytic centers shifted the d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, which strengthened the chemisorption and activation of *CO intermediates, thereby decreasing the whole barrier to produce MeOH. This work demonstrates a novel insight into intermediate manipulation of CO2R and highlights the potential of molecular electrocatalysis for carbon valorization.

         <title>Mechanofluorochromic Elastomers Based on Reversible Helical Transition of Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymeric mechanofluorochromic (MFC) mechanism is introduced, which utilizes force&#8208;induced conformational transition of the helical main chain in poly(phenylacetylene) from cis&#8208;cisoid to cis&#8208;transoid. This mechanism enables reversible fluorescence behavior, making it applicable to advanced MFC elastomers with high MFC sensitivity and superior reversibility.








Abstract
Mechanofluorochromic (MFC) materials possessing both high sensitivity and excellent reversibility are crucial for achieving real&#8208;time mechanical sensing and biomedical probing. Nonetheless, it currently faces the challenge of possessing both critical properties at excellent levels. Herein, we have proposed a reversible polymer mechanochromic mechanophore utilizing a novel mechanism that enables &#8220;turn&#8208;off&#8221; fluorescence, triggered by a force&#8208;induced helical conformational transition in poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) from the fluorescent compact cis&#8208;cisoid (cc) to the non&#8208;fluorescent loose cis&#8208;transoid (ct) conformation. Upon release, the restoring force, coupled with the reformation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, drives the helical backbone to revert to cc conformation, thus enabling reversible mechanofluorochromism. A series of helical PPAs featuring vinyl groups underwent covalent crosslinking with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), yielding a range of MFC elastomers. We developed an in situ stretching&#8208;fluorescence testing device to achieve real&#8208;time monitoring of force&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra. By adjusting the crosslinking density, Vi&#8208;CP&#8208;0.01@PDMS&#8208;0.003 exhibited the highest MFC sensitivity. Significantly, the novel MFC elastomer showcases outstanding reversibility, maintaining its performance across 10 cycles. This study demonstrates a novel MFC mechanism that produces elastomers with high sensitivity and excellent reversibility, paving the way for further MFC materials development based on innovative mechanism.

         <title>In Situ Orthogonal Chemistry for Facile Preparation of Uniform COF&#8208;Based Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step in situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs is achieved via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF). This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF within the polymer, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) represent a promising platform for advanced lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) with high energy density. However, conventional physical fabrication methods may suffer from cumbersome processing, filler agglomeration, and high interfacial resistance. Here we report the in&#8208;situ preparation of COF&#8208;based CPEs via a BF3&#8208;mediated concurrent Schiff base condensation and cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) directly from the monomer mixture of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde (TFTA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) within LMBs. Notably, the H2O generated from the polycondensation reaction effectively serves as the chain transfer agent for THF ROP, reducing the molecular weight of polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) to facilitate Li+ transference, instead of corroding the lithium anode. This orthogonal reaction protocol enables uniform dispersion of COF fillers within the polymer matrix, establishes long&#8208;range ordered Li+ transport pathways, and weakens the Li+&#8208;ether oxygen coordination. Consequently, the ionic conductivity increases 80&#8208;fold (2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) with a Li+ transference number of 0.81 at room temperature. Coupled with a fluorine&#8208; and boron&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from BF3, the CPEs endow Li/LiFePO4 half batteries with excellent cycling stability. This work provides a paradigm for designing interface&#8208;compatible electrolytes through spatially controlled orthogonal synthesis.

         <title>Persistent Membrane&#8208;Anchored Oligomeric Peptides with Nanopore Formation for Targeted Immune Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new class of oligomeric helical peptides through rational design and high&#8208;throughput screening. With unique side&#8208;chain functional group and geometric structure, they could form persistent nanopores on tumor cell membrane. The unique structure and PD&#8208;L1 targeting of peptides could inhibit tumor growth with physical disruption and immunotherapy effects.








Abstract
In the field of targeted diagnosis and therapy, one of the key challenges is the off&#8208;target effect of these recognition molecules. Herein, a new class of oligomeric helical peptides is introduced through rational design and high&#8208;throughput screening to address this challenge. Following amino acid mutations and structural optimizations, lead candidates TA03 and TA10 were identified. Thereinto, TA03 was shown to specifically recognize the PD&#8208;L1 target and employ a unique aromatic side&#8208;chain anchoring strategy to form stable nanopores on the tumor cell membrane, ensuring prolonged residence time. This structure from the precise match between helix length and lipid bilayer thickness, alongside the positioning of two tryptophan (Trp) residues near the peptide terminus. Both Trp side chains interact with the phospholipid membrane via aromatic&#8208;hydrophobic forces, allowing TA03 to form an &#8220;hourglass&#8208;like&#8221; pore structure. This design ensures proper membrane localization and extends residence time on tumor cells of TA03, increasing the persistent interactions between TA03 and PD&#8208;L1, effectively avoiding off&#8208;target effects. Furthermore, the unique structure and PD&#8208;L1 targeting of TA03 cause physical disruption to tumor cells boosting immunotherapy effects and inhibiting tumor growth. It provides an avenue for new molecular structure to overcome off&#8208;target effect towards the membrane associate targets.

Mechanochromic mechanophores function as force&#8208;reporting molecules in polymer materials. In their Research Article (e202510114), Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#160;al. demonstrate the first hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on [2.2]paracyclophane. Polyurethane films covalently incorporating the mechanophore exhibit excimer&#8208;dominant emission in the force&#8208;free state. Upon mechanical activation, force&#8208;induced separation of the associated fluorophores leads to a change in fluorescence color from excimer&#8208;dominant bright yellow to monomer&#8208;dominant blue&#8208;green.

         <title>Atorvastatin&#8208;Loaded Mineralized Vaccine Reprograms Endosomal Trafficking to Amplify STING&#8208;Driven Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomineralized nanovaccine (OVA&#8208;ATV@MnO&#8322;) spatiotemporally co&#8208;delivers and releases tumor antigen, atorvastatin, and Mn adjuvants in dendritic cells. Atorvastatin reprograms endosomal trafficking to delay lysosomal degradation, enhancing antigen cross&#8208;presentation via MHC&#8208;I, while Mn2+ activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying dendritic cell maturation and antitumor T&#8208;cell responses. This dual&#8208;action strategy achieves potent tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable anticancer immunity.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;targeted nanovaccines offer great promise for cancer immunotherapy but are severely limited by premature lysosomal degradation of antigens, which reduces cross&#8208;presentation efficacy. Here, we report a facile yet effective biomineralization strategy to construct nanovaccine (OVA&#8208;ATV@MnO&#8322;) that co&#8208;delivers ovalbumin (OVA) and atorvastatin (ATV) within MnO&#8322; matrix. The ATV&#8208;mediated nanovaccine reprograms endosomal trafficking by inhibiting the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thereby delaying endosomal maturation and preventing antigen diversion to degradative lysosomes. This intervention significantly enhances antigen preservation and MHC&#8208;I presentation in DCs. Simultaneously, the MnO&#8322; framework not only stabilizes the vaccine nanostructure but also releases Mn2&#8314; ions as an adjuvant to potently activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying DC maturation and antitumor T&#8208;cell priming. In vivo studies demonstrate that the nanovaccine induces robust tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable prophylactic immunity. By synergistically rewiring intracellular antigen trafficking and amplifying STING&#8208;mediated immune activation, this mineralized vaccine platform provides a transformative strategy for precise cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Confined Covalent&#8208;Organic Framework Pores as Nanoreactors for CO2 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquid&#8208;confined triazine&#8208;COF nanopores in the Z&#8208;scheme COF/BiVO4 nanocomposites serve as efficient nanoreactors for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Its excellent performances stem from the Z&#8208;scheme promoted charge&#8208;separation for increasing electron density in the nanoreactor. Moreover, the nanoconfinement effects enable directed interfacial electron transfer, and enhanced CO2 capture/activation through in situ ionic liquid redistribution.








Abstract
The topological nanopores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show promise as spatially confined nanoreactors for solar CO2 photoconversion. However, simultaneously increasing the electron density, improving the electron transfer, CO2 capture, and catalytic efficiency within nanopores remains a challenge for optimizing the performance of such nanoreactors. Here, micro&#8208; and mesoporous triazine&#8208;COFs were in situ grown on amino&#8208;modified BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO), respectively, obtaining two&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions. A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf2]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL&#8208;confined COF mesopore&#8208;nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38&#8208;fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH4 in pure water under UV&#8208;vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z&#8208;scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi&#8208;hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM]+ cations, ii) promoted CO2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM]+ cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.

         <title>Zwitterionic Electrolyte Additive for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Ammonium Alkyl Sulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate additive that can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte is developed, which enables kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction, thereby promoting the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species domain interface and excellent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Electrolyte additive is an important component of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. At present, commercial film&#8208;forming additives can only work on either anode or cathode so as to increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the electrolyte. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (TEAPS) additive, which can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. The kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction of TEAPS promotes the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species domain interface, thereby enables greatly improved cycling performance. It is believed that the zwitterionic TEAPS will work as a novel versatile additive for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

This work presents a fast, room&#8208;temperature synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline, highly fluorinated 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs). We achieved the growth of 3&#8208;micron&#8208;long COF rods, enabling the precise study of their mechanical properties and aggregation states. The crystallization process was computationally elucidated, revealing the critical roles of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroaniline in promoting Schiff base bond formation and improving COF crystallinity. This study offers new insights into the controlled synthesis of 2D COFs, with implications for their use in a range of advanced materials applications.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a special kind of crystalline polymers produced by the polycondensation reaction of organic linkers. However, the polymerization is often uncontrolled and conventionally yields polycrystalline powders. For that reason, the development of new methods to obtain single&#8208;crystalline COFs is an urgent need. Herein, we report a modulated, room&#8208;temperature, and fast synthesis of a highly fluorinated COF where the reaction conditions were systematically analyzed to yield single&#8208;crystalline rods of around three microns. The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF. This study reveals new insights into the crystallization of high&#8208;quality 2D COFs.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Dearomatization of Pyridines and Quinolines Enabled by the Carbodication Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly 1,4&#8208;selective reduction of pyridines and quinolines is described enabled by the carbodication Lewis acid. Most notably, the pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the C2 positions can be selectively reduced for the first time.








Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines (DHPs) are valuable compounds in medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. The most straightforward pathway for preparing 1,4&#8208;DHPs is the direct 1,4&#8208;reduction of pyridines and quinolines. However, existing strategies are not effective for pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the C2 position. To address this long&#8208;standing issue, a new strategy has been developed that utilizes underexplored carbodications as the Lewis acids to activate pyridines. For the first time, pyridines with &#8208;CN and &#8208;ester substituents at the C2 position have been successfully converted to 1,4&#8208;DHPs through direct reductive dearomatization in exclusive C4 selectivity. The potential utility of this 1,4&#8208;DHP synthetic protocol is demonstrated with C5&#8208;bromination, C5&#8208;trifluoromethylation, C5&#8208;deuteration, and C4&#8208;deuteration of pyridines using the in situ generated 1,4&#8208;DHPs as key intermediates.

         <title>Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction Efficiency Through Improved Interaction Enabled by a Decorated Covalent&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF was prepared and used for the photoreduction of CO2. Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF achieves a CO production rate of 30.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2&#160;h. The small pore size of the host increases the local pressure, reduces diffusion of the adsorbed CO2, shortens the distance for photoelectron transfer, and favors CO2 activation and conversion.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 is often hindered by the sluggish kinetics for its activation. Refinement of host&#8211;guest interactions is an effective strategy to overcome this barrier. Here, we report the immobilization of active Co(II) sites within a covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) with a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain structure, Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF, which demonstrates a remarkable CO generation rate of 30.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a high CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2&#160;h for CO2 photoreduction at room temperature. The pore size of Co&#8208;PyPDA&#8208;COF is comparable to the diameter of CO2, which allows simultaneous interaction of a single CO2 molecule with the two Co(II) sites. The enhanced interaction result in increased local CO2 pressure, limited CO2 diffusion after adsorption, shortened distance for photoelectron transfer, and reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step in CO2 reduction, promoting CO2 activation and conversion. This work opens a new way to design efficient catalysts by optimizing the pore size of the host.

         <title>Intercalation Chemistry Awakens Transition Metal Hydroxide for Boosted and Sustained Electrocatalytic Sulfion Oxidation</title>

MoO42&#8722; intercalated Co(OH)2 nanosheet array is engineered for promoted electrocatalytic sulfion oxidation. Combined experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO42&#8722; intercalation can strengthen mass transfer, and impressively, manipulate electronic structure to weaken HS&#8722; and S8 binding, and decrease |&#916;Gs*|, consequently awakening Co(OH)2 for remarkably boosted and sustained SOR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) is a sustainable approach to treat sulfion&#8208;rich sewage for S recovery. Transition metal hydroxide (TMOH), utilized in various electrocatalysis, yet is clumsy in SOR due to overstrong adsorption toward S&#8208;containing intermediates from unsuitable electronic structure. Herein we report, for the first time, that the SOR performance of TMOH can be awakened by intercalation chemistry. Take Co(OH)2 as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, MoO42&#8722; intercalated Co(OH)2 2D nanosheet array is engineered, and presents remarkably enhanced SOR behavior with an ultralow potential of 0.29&#160;V versus RHE to attain 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a record Tafel slope of 27.7&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and stable operation for 192&#160;h without appreciable deterioration. The experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO42&#8722;&#8208;intercalated nanoarray is advantageous for active site exposure, and boosting mass transport with enhanced sulfion enrichment and superhydrophilicity. Impressively, MoO42&#8722; intercalation can manipulate electronic structure of Co(OH)2 with downshift of d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening binding strength with HS&#8722; and S8, and decreasing the |&#916;Gs*|, eventually enhancing both activity and stability. Notably, such intercalation wake&#8208;up strategy for the SOR is general and can be extended to other oxometallate intercalated TMOH systems. This contribution provides a new paradigm to evoke TMOH for SOR electrocatalysis via elegant intercalation tactic.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Packing Mode Variations and Chirality Inversion in Short Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports subtle pH&#8208;dependent chirality inversions through designed amphiphilic peptides. The underlying mechanism is revealed to be closely related to the protonation state of the hydrophilic His residue. The protonated His promotes antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing and left&#8208;handed fibril assembly, whereas the deprotonated His facilitates parallel packing and right&#8208;handed fibril assembly, driven by interstrand His&#8211;His interactions.








Abstract
Precise control of structures and morphologies in peptide self&#8208;assembly has been challenging. We report the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptides I3H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C&#8208;terminal histidine&#8208;based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self&#8208;assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH&#8208;dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of &#946;&#8208;strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH&#8208;dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I3GH assembly maintaining this effect while I3GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual &#946;&#8208;sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side&#8208;chain interactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer of Ag(II) CF2X Carboxylates: Quantum Yield and Electrophotocatalytic Arene Fluoroalkylation Tuned by X</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkylation methods beyond CF3 incorporation are less common but highly desirable. Herein, we leverage Ag(II) ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) to achieve catalytic installation of CF2X moieties onto (hetero)arenes directly from abundant fluoroalkyl carboxylates. Furthermore, the isolation of a series of well&#8208;defined Ag(II) CF2X carboxylate compounds allows for the study of how LMCT quantum efficiency is modulated by the X substituent.








Abstract
Incorporation of CF2X groups beyond CF3 into arene scaffolds is underdeveloped despite these groups&#8217; utility as halogen&#8208;bond donors and as precursors to bioisosteres. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and comparative photochemistry of a suite of [Ag(II)(bpy)2O2CCF2X]+ and Ag(II)(bpy)(O2CCF2X)2 (bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, X&#160;=&#160;F, CF3, Cl, Br, H, CH3) carboxylate complexes. We find a dramatic effect of the X substituent on the efficiency of generating CF2X radicals by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), with Ag(II) photoreduction rates varying by over an order of magnitude and quantum yields spanning over 20%. We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)&#8211;O2CCF2X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)&#8208;mediated electrophotocatalytic CF2X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes. This work expands the nascent field of Ag(II)&#8208;based photocatalysis by allowing for (hetero)aryl&#8211;CF2X functionalization directly from unactivated fluoroalkyl carboxylate precursors.

Abstract
We reported a metal&#8208;free ethynylsulfone&#8208;based phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization for the efficient synthesis of stereoregulated poly(&#946;&#8208;aryloxylvinylsulfone)s (PAVSs), a new class of polymers exhibiting inherent responsiveness to multiple stimuli. This polymerization exhibits superior reactivity, yielding high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers whose stereochemistry (Z/E configuration) can be precisely modulated by catalysts, monomer concentration, and solvents. The resulting Z&#8208; and E&#8208;enriched PAVSs demonstrate distinct thermal and mechanical properties, highlighting the impact of stereochemical control on material performance. Furthermore, new stimulus&#8208;induced transformations have been developed on the PAVS platform. A catalyst&#8208;free amine exchange reaction enables both precise polymer degradation and direct polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion under mild conditions. Moreover, an unprecedented C&#9552;C bond cleavage reaction between PAVSs and N,N'&#8208;diethylethylenediamine affords methylated products, representing a rare example of alkene bond scission via simple diamine treatment. A photoinduced rearrangement reaction has also been established, leading to significant fluorescence enhancement upon UV irradiation. This photochemical behavior underpins potential applications in secure information encoding and encrypted communication.

Highly efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters were developed through the construction of multipathway charge transfer characteristics. OLEDs employing the optimized molecule as the terminal emitter and as a sensitizer exhibit high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, achieving EQEs of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, with corresponding CIE&#8208;y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.








Abstract
BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are in high demand to achieve a wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we report deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters featuring a unique donor1&#8208;donor2&#8208;acceptor (D1&#8208;D2&#8208;A) molecular configuration in which C1&#8208;N linked carbazole derivatives serve as dual&#8208;function donors and an oxygen&#8208;bridged triarylboron unit acts as the acceptor. The new design strategy focuses on constructing excited states with multipathway charge transfer characteristics&#8212;including multiresonance, through&#8208;bond, and through&#8208;space charge transfer&#8212;by precisely tuning the relative electron&#8208;donating strengths of the D1 and D2 units. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the optimized emitter, BO&#8208;BTC, achieves a well&#8208;balanced trade&#8208;off among emission efficiency, color purity, singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and horizontal dipole orientation ratio. Consequently, OLEDs using BO&#8208;BTC as the terminal emitter or as the sensitizer for &#957;&#8208;DABNA achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#8208;y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiophenes from Pyridines Using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophenes can be disconnected to pyridines through a novel formal [4&#160;+&#160;1] treatment of Zincke ketones with elemental sulfur. In situ ring&#8208;opening of the &#960;&#8208;deficient heteroarene gives an extended diene, which undergoes simple reaction with octasulfur to give the &#960;&#8208;excessive thiophene.








Abstract
We describe a skeletal editing of pyridines to afford thiophenes through a formal [4&#160;+&#160;1] reaction using elemental sulfur. 2&#8208;Arylpyridines are converted to ring&#8208;opened aza&#8208;triene Zincke ketone structures, followed by simple treatment with sulfur to give 2&#8208;aroylthiophene products directly. The amphiphilic character of octasulfur enables smooth reaction with the Zincke dienamine, affording the cyclized products under mild and neutral conditions. We illustrate this new disconnection with a synthesis of the anti&#8208;inflammatory drug suprofen from a pyridine starting material.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkyl Displacement of Thioethers for Streamlined Trideuteromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical approach has been developed for late&#8208;stage direct trideuteromethyl incorporation into thioethers by using stoichiometric methanol&#8208;d4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source. Mechanistic studies showed that the sulfonium salt generated in situ is the key intermediate. Control experiments revealed that in situ generation of the sulfonium and its subsequent reduction at the cathode is the key to alkyl displacement and precise late&#8208;stage trideuteration.








Abstract
Deuterated compounds exhibit significant pharmacokinetic advantages and have been widely applied in drug discovery. Trideuteromethyl&#8208;containing compounds represent a substantial portion of both approved deuterated drugs and those in development. Traditional approaches to incorporate trideuterated methyl group with trideuterated methyl sources (such as iodomethane&#8208;d3, dimethyl sulfate&#8208;d6) require preactivated synthetic precursor, limiting the application for the late&#8208;stage trideuteromethyl group incorporation of pharmaceutical molecules. Herein, we develop an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage trideuteromethyl incorporation of thioether by using stoichiometric methanol&#8208;d4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source via a sulfide alkyl displacement. This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram&#8208;scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in&#8208;situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate. A series of control experiments reveals that alkanes as the departing moiety are the key to alkyl displacement and precise late&#8208;stage trideuteration.

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Release of a Dual Payload from a &#946;&#8208;Lactam Mechanophore with a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane device operates as a logic AND gate to release a single or dual cargo payload upon application of force in the absence or the presence of water, respectively. This concept was demonstrated with the release of a ketene and varied drugs, paving the way for precision release applications.








Abstract
The force&#8208;controlled release of functional molecules has attracted interest due to its potential use in drug delivery and self&#8208;healing applications. Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here, we present a rotaxane&#8208;based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.

         <title>Interfacial Diffusion&#8208;Reaction Coupling Strategy for CO2 Reduction on Copper Surface in Acidic Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong dipole moment unit, azulene, is used to polarize sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen&#8208;enriched polymer and further enhance CO2 adsorption and transporting on catalytic polycrystalline copper surface. A remarkable Faradaic efficiency of nearly 84% for C2 products has been achieved at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 40&#160;h in acid, reaching the record for CO2 reduction in acidic media.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C2+) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single&#8208;pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong&#8208;polarized layer&#8208;covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp3&#8208;N)&#8208;enriched azulene&#8208;based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO2&#8208;diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84%&#160;C2 Faradaic efficiency at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and demonstrates long&#8208;term stability over 40&#160;h, which is the record for CO2RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene&#8208;polarized sp3&#8208;N&#8208;enriched micro&#8208;environment can increase the local CO2/H2O ratio at electric double&#8208;layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop&#8208;bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong&#8208;polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp3&#8208;N&#8208;enriched micro&#8208;environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion&#8208;reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO2RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong&#8208;polarized polymers.

         <dc:description>
A ligand type concept guided a central aromatic keto&#8208;arylation in the first total syntheses of CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100. Davis oxidation with catalytic base and late&#8208;stage aminolysis completed the route. This strategy provides modular, concise and high&#8208;yielding access to uncharted polycyclic xanthones. Meanwhile, ligand types emerge as a powerful design tool in sophisticated cross couplings.








Abstract
The first total synthesis of the potent polycyclic xanthone antibiotics CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100 was accomplished by a modular strategy featuring a very demanding intermolecular aromatic keto&#8208;arylation. Central to the solution was a recently&#8208;developed ligand type approach, rather than brute force screening, demonstrating the usefulness of this novel concept in complex target synthesis. Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late&#8208;stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high&#8208;yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Nondestructive Patterning of Upconverting and Down&#8208;Shifting Luminescent Nanoparticles for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the nondestructive patterning of both upconverting and down&#8208;shifting luminescent nanoparticles by rationally designing the chemical structure of a three&#8208;armed diazo crosslinker (3G). The 3G&#8208;based patterning method enables the fabrication of arbitrary patterns with high fidelity, high resolution (down to nanoscale), and fully preserved structural and optical properties. The ability of this method to sequentially pattern different luminescent nanoparticles offers a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro&#8208; and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid&#8208;state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three&#8208;armed diazo crosslinker (3G) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C&#9472;H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18&#160;mJ cm&#8722;2, in stark contrast to 200&#8211;500&#160;mJ cm&#8722;2 for diazirine&#8208;based crosslinkers) required for sufficient crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G, and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G&#8208;based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi&#8208;layer structures for dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system&#8208;level devices.

This cover shows how two stimuli, force and water, are necessary to unlock the release of various drugs from a rotaxane molecular device. Mechanical force is used to break a &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophore with the help of a rotaxane actuator illustrated by a pillar[5]arene macrocycle threaded onto a rope. The scission of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring reveals an imine, which is subsequently hydrolysed in the presence of water to unlock the release of drug molecules, as reported by Guillaume De Bo et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202512698).

With great respect for bears, which, in the past, were used to harvest their bile containing ursodeoxycholic acid &#8211; a key building block in this study &#8211; we developed a flexible and unsymmetric coordination ligand L. L reacts with salts of shiny palladium forming helical Pd6L8 and Pd12L16 cages via flexibility&#8208;aided orientational self&#8208;sorting. The cages undergo structural transformations induced by changing reaction conditions and exhibit toxicity in vitro using spheroids of hepatic cells HepG2. Details of the study are reported by Ond&#345;ej Jur&#269;ek et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202513902).

A tetraphenylethylene&#8208;conjugated poly(L&#8208;cysteine) vesicle was engineered to execute a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;to&#8208;&#946;&#8208;turn conformational transformation driven by reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation, as reported by Mingming Ding et&#160;al. (e202503875). The transition boosted fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence, enabling dual&#8208;modal tracking of conformational changes, and mediated a full color&#8208;reportable drug release, allowing efficient imaging and treatment of tumors.

Its Ir complex exhibited high efficiency in the hydrogen isotope exchange of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted arenes by cooperative catalysis of the Ir complex and the Lewis&#8208;acidic sites on BBcat. BBcat and the Ir complex are symbolically associated with mythological Genbu and Suzaku. Genbu, a tortoise entwined with a snake, reflects BBcat's dual nature.

         <title>Electron Spin Resonance at the Single&#8208;Molecule Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides an overview of the four electron&#8208;spin&#8208;resonance techniques with single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, relying on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning&#8208;probe microscopy. After introducing underlying common concepts, it reviews the working principles, experimental conditions and key achievements.








Abstract
Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a widely employed spectroscopic technique for studying systems with unpaired electron spins, such as molecular radicals. Typically, many billions of spins are required to get a detectable ESR signal, which is subject to extensive ensemble averaging. Downscaling ESR to a single molecule allows studying the signatures of each individual molecule separately, applicable to biomolecules in their native environment, for example. Single&#8208;molecule ESR offers several novel research avenues, such as in quantum sensing with a single molecule. Over the last decades, four different single&#8208;molecule ESR approaches have been developed, which rely on either optically detected magnetic resonance or scanning&#8208;probe microscopy. An introduction into these four approaches including their deployment in pioneering works will be provided.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Molecular Tools in Precise Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted single&#8208;molecule drugs, nanodrugs, and polymeric drugs have become important molecular tools in tumor therapy. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in molecular tools for mitochondria&#8208;targeted precision tumor therapy, providing valuable references to facilitate the clinical translation of precision medicine.








Abstract
Precise therapy for tumors faces challenges associated with traditional methods, such as low targeting efficiency, substantial side effects, and drug resistance. As the core regulators of cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, mitochondria exhibit considerable advantages through targeted molecular tools that precisely deliver drugs, interfere with key pathways, and activate immune responses. This article reviews the latest advancements in mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular tools for precision tumor therapy. Modifying molecular structures or designing functionalized carriers, small molecular drugs, metal complexes, nanodrugs, and polymeric drugs can be precisely enriched in mitochondria, disrupting the mitochondrial membrane, interfering with the respiratory chain, or activating immune pathways, thereby significantly enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. However, further optimization of the design of mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular tools is required, and their synergistic potential with immunotherapy metabolic regulation, and mitochondrial DNA targeting warrants further exploration. The rational design of mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular tools holds great promise for achieving precise, personalized, and low&#8208;toxicity tumor therapy.

         <title>Radical C&#9472;H&#8208;Aroylation of Allenes via Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and photoredox catalysis for C&#9472;H benzoylation and esterification of allenes is presented. This reaction proceeds through the cross&#8208;coupling of in situ generated ketyl and allyl radicals.








Abstract
This study demonstrates the use of cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis for sp2 C&#9472;H acylation of allenes. The cascade comprises oxidative generation of an allene radical cation from an allene, its nucleophilic trapping to the corresponding allyl radical and highly regioselective cross coupling by a concomitantly reductively generated NHC&#8208;derived ketyl type radical. Ionic fragmentation of both the NHC and nucleophile ultimately yields the desired substituted allene. The organic photocatalyst, 4CzIPN, is highly effective in promoting both oxidative and reductive electron transfer steps. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenes can be obtained in good yields through such a cascade. Mechanistic studies&#8212;including radical trapping, acylazolium reactions, and Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching&#8212;support the proposed mechanism. Moreover, follow&#8208;up chemistry is conducted to demonstrate the synthetic value of the cascade products.

The catalytically active periphery around oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles is key in reactions featuring marked metal&#8208;oxide promotional effects. For Cu/ZrO2 CO2 hydrogenation catalysts, a Cu interparticle spacing of &#8764;15&#160;nm optimizes methanol production rate and selectivity. This spacing maximizes the surface density of formate intermediates on peripheral ZrO2 which are dynamically turned over, marking a shift in the reaction's kinetic control.








Abstract
The periphery surrounding oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal&#8208;oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15&#160;nm. Operando modulation&#8211;excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface&#8208;bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal&#8208;specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal&#8208;oxide interfaces.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroboration of Dienol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers, achieving fourfold regioselectivity (1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;) with high selectivity. This includes the first 4,1&#8208;selective example and expands asymmetric hydroboration to previously inaccessible trisubstituted and oxygen&#8208;substituted dienes.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well&#8208;established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom&#8208;substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac)2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2&#8208;, 4,1&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, and 4,3&#8208;hydroboration products in good yields and high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99%). Mechanistic studies, including deuterium&#8208;labeling, kinetic, and UV&#8211;vis experiments, suggest the involvement of Co&#8211;H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late&#8208;stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.

         <title>Dizygotic Atomic Platinum and Palladium on Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Ethanol and Methanol Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been explored to maximize Pt utilization, but they struggle to efficiently activate the C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds in alcohols. Multi&#8208;metallic dizygotic&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), which incorporate multiple metal atoms in dispersed active sites, offer a promising alternative by enhancing catalytic activity through metal synergy. Pt and Pd, with similar electronic properties, can work synergistically in DASCs to improve alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation efficiency. 








Abstract
Dizygotic&#8208;atom&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), consisting of multi&#8208;atomic dispersed catalytic centers, perform well in several reactions but have poor electrocatalytic activity toward alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation. In this study, DASCs of atomically dispersed platinum and palladium on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (Pt1Pd1/NCNC) are successfully synthesized using an impregnation&#8211;adsorption method. The Pt1Pd1/NCNC catalyst has higher mass activity toward ethanol and methanol oxidation than commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. In contrast, Pt or Pd single&#8208;atom catalysts on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanocages are virtually inert. Ethanol and methanol on Pt1Pd1/NCNC are electro&#8208;oxidized to acetate ion and CO2 as the final product, respectively. Pt1Pd1/NCNC exhibits long&#8208;term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate. Ab initio simulations show that Pt1Pd1/NCNC optimizes the ethanol oxidation pathway thanks to a lower energy barrier and onset potential than individual single Pt or Pd atom catalysts on NCNC. This study opens a new path to developing advanced DASCs for alcohol oxidation.

Developing a peptide&#8211;gold nanocluster&#8208;assembled binder (PEGNAB) platform provides new opportunities for replacing antibodies in the diagnostic field. We demonstrated that PEGNAB, composed of gold nanoclusters and polymeric peptides, can densely bind to the surface of virions, leading to signal amplification. The universal nature of the PEGNAB model was demonstrated by the successful detection of a single influenza A virus.








Abstract
Ultrasensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection is urgently required for viruses with high infectivity and lethality rates. In this study, we developed a direct detection platform, a peptide&#8211;gold nanocluster&#8208;assembled binder (PEGNAB), in which antigen&#8208;binding polymeric peptides are modified on a single gold nanocluster. This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500&#8211;800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1&#8211;100&#160;copies per well. A PEGNAB&#8208;based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity. In a double&#8208;blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrate that different PEGNAB&#8208;based target binding modes can be readily adapted to various pathogens by altering the peptide sequence.

The proposed TCN&#8208;engineered cell strategy enables cell engineering via carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic &#946; cells without the need for chemical modification, while the TiOx quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound&#8208;responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from &#946; cells, which features cell packaging and functionalization through the use of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanocomposites.








Abstract
Engineered cell&#8208;based therapy is an emerging approach for treating intractable diseases, in which the remote control of cellular behavior necessitates robust physical input&#8208;sensing&#8208;response systems. Nanomaterials represent promising tools to enable&#160;wireless remote control of cells. To achieve this, the precise anchoring of nanomaterials to target cells is crucial for nanomaterial&#8208;engineered cells to prevent undesired effects such as endocytosis and diffusion. Herein, we describe a general cell engineering strategy using nanomaterials to achieve remote&#8208;controlled and sustained insulin release from the engineered pancreatic &#946; cells.

&lt;p&gt;The proposed TCN-engineered cell strategy enables cell engineering via carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic &#946; cells without the need for chemical modification, while the TiOx quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound-responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from &#946; cells, which features cell packaging and functionalization through the use of two-in-one nanocomposites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineered cell-based therapy is an emerging approach for treating intractable diseases, in which the remote control of cellular behavior necessitates robust physical input-sensing-response systems. Nanomaterials represent promising tools to enable&#160;wireless remote control of cells. To achieve this, the precise anchoring of nanomaterials to target cells is crucial for nanomaterial-engineered cells to prevent undesired effects such as endocytosis and diffusion. Herein, we describe a general cell engineering strategy using nanomaterials to achieve remote-controlled and sustained insulin release from the engineered pancreatic &#946; cells. The prepared nanocomposite, termed TCN, is composed of defect-rich titanium oxide quantum dots with ultrasound-electric conversion effect and fibrous carbon substrate. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the TCN enables cell surface engineering through carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic &#946; cells without chemical modification, while the TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound-responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from &#946; cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subcutaneous implantation of TCN-engineered &#946; cell complexes in type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice enables the restoration of normoglycemia by ultrasound stimulation, establishing a nanomaterials-enabled controlled cell therapy paradigm for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma Using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through modular protein engineering, we generate targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil domain and RGD peptides, we increase micelle size, drug loading capacity, and cancerous uptake. In vivo, TMPA preferentially accumulates in intracranially implanted glioblastoma tumors in mice.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and the ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of the targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increase in doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulation compared to TRAP and demonstrates a 1.3&#8208;fold improvement in uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is intravenously administered to mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and to control mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model reveals a significantly prolonged distribution&#8208;phase (short&#8208;phase) half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control, while the elimination&#8208;phase (slow&#8208;phase) half&#8208;life remains comparable between groups. This suggests altered early&#8208;phase kinetics likely due to tumor&#8208;associated sequestration or retention. The resulting increased area under the concentration&#8208;time curve (AUC) in tumor&#8208;bearing mice supports enhanced accumulation or slower clearance. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs and 3D reconstructions of whole mouse heads further corroboratesa preferential localization of NIR&#8208;TMPA in tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of TMPA and its future derivatives for targeted GBM therapy.

         <title>Stable Yet Strongly Lewis&#8208;Acidic Anions Enabling Cooperative Catalysis with Cationic Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable tetraarylborate anion, BBcat, possessing strong Lewis acidity was synthesized. BBcat serves as a weakly coordinating counteranion for the cationic transition&#8208;metal complex, and its Ir complex exhibited up to 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than the common counteranion BArF in the hydrogen isotope exchange of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted arenes by cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition&#8208;metal complex and the Lewis&#8208;acidic counteranion.








Abstract
Ionic transition&#8208;metal complexes play a crucial role as catalysts in organic transformations. Their counteranions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Br&#248;nsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis&#8208;acidic anion, BBcat, based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis&#8208;acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition&#8208;metal catalysis to recognize Lewis&#8208;basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu4N&#8211;BBcat, 31P NMR chemical shift of O&#9552;PEt3 significantly lower&#8208;shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX&#8208;BBcat exhibited an 8.2&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX&#8208;BArF consisting of the non&#8208;coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis&#8208;basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis&#8208;basic sites, located at remote positions to the C&#9472;H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis&#8208;basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition&#8208;metal center and the counteranion.

         <title>Glycoconjugated Metallohelices Eliminate Cancer Stem&#8208;Like Cells via Modulating G&#8208;Quadruplex Surrounding Transcriptional Start Site of Sox2 Gene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) targeted G&#8208;quadruplex surrounding the transcriptional start site of Sox2 gene to eradicate breast cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs) by inhibiting cell viability and stemness.








Abstract
As an important pluripotency transcription factor, Sox2 plays key roles in the stemness maintenance of cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs). Here, we found that a highly conserved G&#8208;rich region surrounding transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of Sox2 gene can form G&#8208;quadruplex (Sox2G4) both in vitro and in cells. More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) rather than &#923;&#8208;f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe2L&#916;&#8208;f3]4+ (&#916;&#8208;f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that &#916;&#8208;f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes of pluripotency genes can regulate the fates of CSCs. Our work provides a new way to target CSC gene and eradicate cancer stem cells.

         <title>Visual &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;to&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Turn Transition in Luminescent Polymeric Vesicles for Color&#8208;Reporting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported for the first time a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#946;&#8208;turn in luminescent poly(L&#8208;cysteine) vesicles. These vesicles not only allow real&#8208;time monitoring of the conformational transition process through changes in fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also exhibit oxidation&#8208;responsive and color&#8208;reporting drug release behaviors for efficient imaging and therapy of tumors in vivo.








Abstract
The secondary structures of polymers significantly influence their properties; however, understanding and modulating polymer conformations remain substantial challenges. Particularly, the &#946;&#8208;turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability.

&lt;p&gt;We reported for the first time a conformational transition from &#946;-sheet to &#946;-turn in luminescent poly(L-cysteine) vesicles. These vesicles not only allow real-time monitoring of the conformational transition process through changes in fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), but also exhibit oxidation-responsive and color-reporting drug release behaviors for efficient imaging and therapy of tumors in vivo.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secondary structures of polymers significantly influence their properties; however, understanding and modulating polymer conformations remain substantial challenges. Particularly, the &#946;-turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability. Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-decorated poly(L-cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic-aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from &#946;-sheet to &#946;-turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual-modal approach to real-time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Sulfide Separation from Carbon Dioxide Achieved by Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Liquids for Natural Gas Upgrading</title>

The efficient separation of H2S from CO2 remains a pivotal challenge in natural gas upgrading. This work pioneers a cascade H2S sorption mechanism enabled by carbonyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids, achieving unprecedented H2S capacity and record&#8208;high H2S/CO2 selectivity, which sets a groundbreaking benchmark for H2S/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H2S from CO2, another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H2S from CH4, the selective removal of H2S from CO2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H2S, departing from conventional acid&#8208;base interaction&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H2S. Dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H2S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H2S into [HS]&#8315; species. The unique cascade H2S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H2S, endowing the [6ca]&#8208;derived ILs with unprecedented high H2S capacities and record&#8208;breaking H2S/CO2 selectivities (67&#8211;89 at 1.0&#160;bar and 229&#8211;319 at 0.1&#160;bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy&#8208;efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H2S/CO2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.

         <title>Small Molecule Promoters of Endogenous Lipid Droplet Accumulation Drive Lysophagy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;fat diets and fatty acids are traditionally used to induce lipid droplet formation in cells and animals. The authors developed a new high&#8208;content imaging platform and identified functionally superior novel small&#8208;molecule lipid droplet inducers. They report the activation of lysophagy, a unique cell death pathway, upon abrupt accumulation of lipid droplets in cancer cells.








Abstract
Lipid droplets (LDs) are central in regulating metabolism in stress&#8208;induced conditions, including one triggered by nutrient deprivation. Genetic manipulation of the lipid metabolic network or supplementation of a high&#8208;fat diet/oleic acid (OA) are the traditional routes for voluntarily triggering LD formation in cells and animals to study the role of LDs in disease biology. We developed a new screening platform for identifying small molecule&#8208;based LD inducers, which identified linoleic acid (LOA, diunsaturated fatty acid) as a better tool than OA (monounsaturated fatty acid) in promoting LD formation in cells. Subsequent screening and validation discovered a novel heterocyclic compound and respective iron complex for promoting a rapid organization of endogenous lipids into droplets by mimicking desaturase function and modulating oxidative lipid metabolism. Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.

         <title>Hydroxyl Spillover Activated from the Strongly Coupled Ru@Mn3O4 Heterostructure to Promote Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to boost alkaline HER activity of Ru via hydroxyl and hydrogen spillover effects activated by the constructed Ru@Mn3O4 heterointerface. Under alkaline condition, water dissociation occurs on Mn3O4 and through spillover processes, OH* and H* migrate to the Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bridge and Ru sites at the interface, respectively. OH* can rapidly desorb from the Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mn sites, and H2 is produced from Ru sites.








Abstract
Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH* desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH* desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn3O4, in which Ru clusters are decorated on Mn3O4 via Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn3O4 facilitates the water dissociation, whereas the formed heterointerface can efficiently desorb OH* via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn3O4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 30&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, surpassing recently reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn3O4 increase about 11&#8208; and 8&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100&#160;mV in 1.0&#160;M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.

         <title>Directional Depolymerization of Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) with High Monomer Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The directional depolymerization of poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) to &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) is achieved in solution through confined catalyst design strategy. The formation of CL&#8208;dimer can be effectively inhibited by the confined pocket formed by the (BisSalen)Al complexes, resulting in a clear boost in monomer selectivity (&gt;99%) and yield (93%), thus to realize the closed&#8208;loop recycling of PCL.








Abstract
Chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the most attractive method for achieving the closed&#8208;loop usage of polymers, in which polymers are recycled back to their starting monomers and then used to produce new polymers without loss of the virgin material properties.

     alt="Directional Depolymerization of Poly(&#949;-caprolactone) with High Monomer Selectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directional depolymerization of poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (PCL) to &#949;-caprolactone (&#949;-CL) is achieved in solution through confined catalyst design strategy. The formation of CL-dimer can be effectively inhibited by the confined pocket formed by the (BisSalen)Al complexes, resulting in a clear boost in monomer selectivity (&amp;gt;99%) and yield (93%), thus to realize the closed-loop recycling of PCL.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the most attractive method for achieving the closed-loop usage of polymers, in which polymers are recycled back to their starting monomers and then used to produce new polymers without loss of the virgin material properties. However, during the CRM process, the depolymerized products are usually accompanied by the formation of byproducts (e.g., cyclic oligomers) in addition to monomers. Therefore, the directional depolymerization to monomer through catalyst design is significant. Herein, we report the directional depolymerization of poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (PCL) to &#949;-caprolactone (&#949;-CL) under solution conditions through innovative design of catalyst structure. The (BisSalen)Al catalysts, featuring a confined cavity, demonstrated exceptional performance, enabling highly selective depolymerization of PCL with excellent monomer selectivity (&amp;gt;99%) and yield (93%). The mechanism of selective depolymerization was further investigated in detail through controlled NMR experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work reveals the correlation between catalyst structure and depolymerization selectivity, providing theoretical guidance for the design of directional depolymerization catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding Optical Properties and Electronic Structures of High&#8208;Entropy Alloyed Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy perovskite (HEP) nanocrystals (NCs) are synthesized and their anomalous optical and electronic signatures are characterized by temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical measurements, electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory. Despite the smaller size of HEP NCs than the Bohr diameter of pristine NCs, they possess wider bandgaps and featureless band structures due to the formation of shallow states. In situ luminescence analysis further demonstrates the superior photostability of HEP NCs thin films.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloying (HEA) has emerged as a prominent strategy to modulate physiochemical properties of nanomaterials. Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA&#8208;induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high&#8208;entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B&#8208;site elements (Pb2+, Sr2&#8314;, Ca2&#8314;, Cd2&#8314;, and Mg2&#8314;). High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr3 NCs (&#8764;7&#160;nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band&#8208;edge shallow states. We show that these HEA&#8208;induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA&#8208;induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.

         <title>Complex Multistate Photophysics of a Rhodanine Photoswitch</title>

Slow switching. A novel photoswitch is observed by ultrafast experiment to have unusually slow excited state dynamics. The pathway is resolved by quantum chemical calculation.








Abstract
Development of new and improved photoswitches for molecular photonics and photo&#8208;pharmaceutics is an increasingly important research objective. Recently a promising family of photoswitches based on the rhodanine motif was described. Here, the photophysics of a typical example are investigated by ultrafast UV and IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, the photophysics are very different to and more complex than those of closely related monomethine photoswitches, which relax by ultrafast internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the rhodanine photoswitch, the allowed Franck&#8211;Condon excited state also relaxes on a sub&#8208;picosecond timescale, but the ground state is repopulated only after several hundred picoseconds. Instead, the Franck&#8211;Condon state relaxes through (at least) two intermediate states. These states are characterized by transient spectroscopy, and the reaction pathway is modeled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggests that a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is rapidly populated via coupling of a nearly degenerate n&#960;* state populated by ultrafast internal conversion from the bright &#960;&#960;* state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has important implications for the synthesis, analysis, and application of rhodanine photoswitches.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Ligation of Four Different Alcohols at One Silicon Center: Methodology Development and Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylchlorosilane (Ph3SiCl) was developed as a tetrachlorosilane surrogate for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center to generate fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the unusual transformations of Wheland intermediates into both silicon cations and silylated phenylhalonium ions in low and comparable activation barriers.








Abstract
While critical and indispensable in diversified areas, organosilicon compounds are not naturally occurring and all rely on chemical synthesis. The de novo synthesis of them via quadruple substitutions of tetrachlorosilane was one of the most straightforward and common practices but confronted over&#8208;substitution challenges for heteroleptic silanes, especially the ones with four different substituents. Although selective and iterative substitutions at silicon have achieved notable achievements, methods for fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes are still lacking. Herein, we established the key dephenylative etherification reaction coupling phenylsilanes and alcohols to alkoxysilanes and then developed triphenylchlorosilane (Ph3SiCl) as the surrogate to tetrachlorosilane for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center as fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the unusual transformations of Wheland intermediates into both silicon cations and silylated phenylhalonium ions in low and comparable activation barriers.

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamic framework is introduced, based on process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to study A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation in reactions between MAX phases and molten salts. By capturing the effects of salt concentration, competing pathways, and temperature, we explain key experimental trends and provide a transferable approach for predicting 2D material synthesis via molten salt etching.








Abstract
Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to&#160;Ti3AlC2, V2AlC, and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt, we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials&#8212;defined here by the Al&#8208;to&#8208;Zn exchange&#8212;of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Cumulene&#8208;Linked Stone&#8208;Wales Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional polymers featuring Stone&#8208;Wales defects and cumulene linkages is demonstrated via thermally and light&#8208;induced reactions on Au(111). STM, nc&#8208;AFM, and Raman spectroscopy, complemented by theory calculations, reveal their chemical structure with a non&#8208;planar geometry, and a distinct electronic bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, underscoring the impact of nonbenzenoid motifs in tuning the properties of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Structural, chemical, and extrinsic modifications of graphene&#8208;based nanostructures enable bandgap tuning, optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum materials design. A well&#8208;known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp2&#8208;hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone&#8208;Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene&#8208;based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on&#8208;surface synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional SW&#8208;based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW&#8208;based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8&#160;eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene&#8208;bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon&#8208;based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.

         <title>From Spiropyran to a Circadian&#8208;Responsive Photochromic Supramolecular System for Sustainable Crop Protection: Enhanced Photostability, Biofilm Disintegration, and Foliar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional supramolecular bactericidal material, SpA6(MC)&#8834;CB[8], was fabricated via the self&#8208;assembly of the bioactive spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), exhibiting circadian rhythm responsiveness. This smart supramolecular system effectively disrupts Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) biofilms while demonstrating enhanced foliar affinity, thereby offering a promising strategy for combating bacterial plant diseases.








Abstract
Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single&#8208;structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm&#8208;eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV&#8208;induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6(MC)&#8834;CB[8], a self&#8208;assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day&#8211;night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%). This work establishes a paradigm for developing light&#8208;responsive supramolecular agrochemicals that combine structural dynamism with enhanced functionality, offering sustainable solutions against plant pathogens.

Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) coordination enhanced dual&#8208;functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for both Zn&#8208;ion storage and deposition control in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual&#8208;functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni&#8211;DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g&#8722;1, respectively after 10&#160;000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni&#8211;DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni&#8211;DAPTO cathodes and Ni&#8211;DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g&#8722;1. These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting aqueous secondary batteries.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Transport in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Through Nanoconfined Triple Phase Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes a new paradigm for leveraging CTBP&#8208;COFs to decouple the competing interactions at the catalyst/PFSA&#8208;ionomer interface, effectively mitigating the poisoning effect of sulfonate groups while enhancing oxygen transport. The strategic incorporation of COFs not only improves catalytic utilization but also reduces interfacial resistance, paving the way for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance fuel cells with significantly reduced platinum loading. 








Abstract
In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple&#8208;phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well&#8208;defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple&#8208;phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen&#8208;enriched transport channels. Under low&#8208;platinum loading conditions (&#8722;0.05&#160;mgPt&#160;cm&#8722;2) in a H2&#9472;O2 PEMFC, the COF&#8208;modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.

         <title>Multiaxial Aromatic&#8208;Based Photoferroelectric Induced by Synergistic Intermolecular Interactions for Multidirectional Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>

In this work, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic&#8208;based photoferroelectric, (4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium)2PbBr4, through synergistic noncovalent interactions between hydrogen bonding and fluorine&#8208;&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. The polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection behavior, demonstrating the potential for next&#8208;generation flexible and thin&#8208;film integrated devices.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics coupling spontaneous polarization and remarkable semiconductor attributes have emerged as promising candidates for self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic&#8208;based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ)2PbBr4 (4Br2FBZ = 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine&#8208;&#960;, which achieves a stable multidirectional self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection. Notably, the aromatic cations rotate driven by synergistic molecular interactions to form a T&#8208;shaped stacking architecture, resembling interlocking puzzle pieces. This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ)2PbBr4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48&#160;&#181;C cm&#8722;2 and a high Curie temperature of 408&#160;K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), and exceptional detection stability. Strikingly, the polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits excellent self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection behavior due to its biaxial ferroelectricity, indicating the potential for next&#8208;generation flexible and thin&#8208;film integrated devices.

         <title>Discharge Rate&#8208;Driven Li2O2 Growth Exhibits Unconventional Morphology Trends in Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is investigated using a polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte. Contrary to liquid systems, larger Li2O2 particles form at higher discharge rates due to space charge layer effects and heterogeneous interfaces. An optimal discharge rate is identified to balance ORR/OER efficiency, side reactions, and long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs) are known for their enhanced safety, higher electrochemical stability, and improved energy density compared to liquid&#8208;state LOBs. However, the investigation of solid&#8208;state LOBs is limited with little understanding of their discharge and charge processes. In this work, a polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state LOB is used to investigate the effect of discharge rate on lithium peroxide (Li2O2) formation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and cycle performance. Notably, we observe a counterintuitive trend: Li2O2 particle size increases with increasing discharge current density, in contrast to liquid systems. This behavior arises from inherent space charge layers that restrict Li&#8314; transport under high current, and spatially heterogeneous active sites at the solid electrolyte&#8211;cathode interface, directly evidenced by small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), which govern nucleation accessibility and promote site&#8208;selective Li2O2 growth. Furthermore, higher current densities improve ORR and OER efficiency but accelerate anode degradation, while lower currents promote side reactions. These opposing effects result in a trade&#8208;off that defines an optimal discharge rate (0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2) for maximizing cycle life. This study provides a new mechanistic perspective on discharge&#8208;driven processes in solid&#8208;state LOBs and offers practical guidelines for performance optimization in future high&#8208;energy battery systems.

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectrosynthesis platform is devised for electrochemical control of cellular signaling under physiological conditions. The system allows on&#8208;demand, selective generation of signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite (NO2&#8722;) ions using Cu2MoS4&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This approach enables independent, electrochemical modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;sensitive ion channels expressed in genetically engineered cells. 








Abstract
Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH3) from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.

         <title>Exposure of Au Atom on Au(111) in Metal Nanoclusters for pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exposed Au atom on Au(111) in Au52 nanoclusters and as&#8208;formed surface/interface environment were constructed by introducing nonaromatic ligand. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed the activation of CO2 and the accelerated protonation of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water by the surface/interface modification, leading to pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysis with high activity, selectivity, and durability.








Abstract
The control of surface and interface structures in nanocatalysts is a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic performance, but significant challenges persist in achieving precisely designed active sites or environments on the surface/interface of fully protected metal nanoclusters. In this study, we report the construction of an exposed Au atom on Au(111) and the formation of a unique surface/interface environment on the Au52 cluster via a cyclopentanethiol&#8208;etching strategy. Theoretical calculations and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared adsorption spectroscopy reveal that the exposed Au atom facilitates CO2 activation, while the tailored surface/interface environment promotes the accumulation of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, which can be validated by the molecular dynamic simulation, thus enhancing proton transfer and suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the surface/interface&#8208;modified Au52 cluster showcases high activity, selectivity, and durability across pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral, and alkaline) electrolytes, providing new insights for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic level.

The concept of &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; was proposed, wherein 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) serves as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest. The host, possessing a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect, is capable of effectively triggering the phosphorescence of the guest that exhibits weak intersystem crossing (ISC). Moreover, the relatively long lifetime of the guest is preserved.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, with long lifetime, large Stokes shift, and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, have great potential in numerous fields. And now, the host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host&#8211;guest&#8208;doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the &#8220;strong assisting weak&#8221; effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79&#160;s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5&#160;s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long&#8208;lived RTP materials.

         <title>Atomic Metal&#8210;Nonmetal Catalytic Pair Cooperatively Drives Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic Mn&#9472;S catalytic pair for driving efficient enzyme&#8208;like catalysis is reported. Poisoning experiments and theoretical calculations reveal a metal&#8210;nonmetal dual&#8208;site cooperative mechanism, in which the S site not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn metal center to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also directly participates in the catalytic process by stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximum atom utilization and well&#8208;defined coordination environments are promising alternatives to natural enzymes. However, their catalytic performance in enzymatic reactions is intrinsically restricted by the scaling relations, which impose an inherent trade&#8208;off between substrate adsorption/activation and product desorption. Here we report atomically dispersed manganese&#8210;sulfur (Mn&#9472;S) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively drive enzymatic catalysis, in which the S atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn site to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also functions as the secondary catalytic site for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption. Consequently, this metal&#8210;nonmetal dual&#8208;site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity. As a potential application, the Mn&#9472;S catalytic pairs with coupled catalase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities are successfully demonstrated for synergistic tumor catalytic therapy. This work establishes a paradigm for the rational design of highly efficient artificial enzymes through catalytic pair engineering.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Molecular Wires for Membrane Potential Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully water&#8208;soluble fluorescent rosamine&#8208;based amphiphilic molecular wires were developed for imaging membrane potentials. The performance of the probes was evaluated in single cardiomyocytes, murine pituitary gland, and islets of Langerhans.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;sensitive probes based on donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, whose fluorescence is modulated by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) in response to changes in membrane potential, are known as PET molecular wires. PET wires have been widely used in cultured cells; however, their applications in tissue&#8208;level imaging have been hampered by their inadequate aqueous solubility, necessitating pre&#8208;dissolution in organic solvents that potentially can cause toxic effects. Here we present the synthesis, electronic structure analysis, photophysical characterization, and initial demonstration of water&#8208;soluble amphiphilic molecular wires, consisting of a rosamine, as a fluorescent PET acceptor, and a PET donor consisting of a conjugated bridge terminated by dimethylaniline (DMA). The rosamine moiety is extended by several carboxylates or polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, which render the probes highly water&#8208;soluble and facilitate labeling of phospholipid membranes, positioning molecules in proper orientation. The probes produced functional responses in electrically stimulated mouse cardiomyocytes and as well as in intact neurohypophysis, and in glucose&#8208;stimulated murine islets of Langerhans. The new molecular wires make up a useful addition to the toolkit of optical reporters for membrane potential imaging.

         <title>Harnessing Pyridinic N Vacancy Defect in Microporous Structures to Induce the Pre&#8208;Adsorption of Oxygen and Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study confirms the role of O2 pre&#8208;adsorption on Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs, a mechanism previously only predicted by theoretical calculations. The results show that the interaction between O2 molecules and pyridinic N vacancy defects shifts the d&#8208;band center of the central Fe atom away from the Fermi level, thereby facilitating the ORR kinetics.








Abstract
Defect structures within the carbon matrix play a crucial role in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe single atom and nitrogen&#8208;doped catalysts (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs). However, overlooking the O2 pre&#8208;adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe&#8208;Nv&#8208;C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe&#8208;Nv&#8208;C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre&#8208;adsorption of O2 molecules results in the d&#8208;band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre&#8208;adsorption of O2 molecules on Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Design of Polymeric Semiconductor Nanomotors with Multichannel Sensitive 3D Motion for Microorganism Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

A novel class of light&#8208;driven nanomotors based on polymeric semiconductor phenolic resins achieves precise 3D motion under multiwavelength light, guided by rational molecular design. The enhanced mobility and antimicrobial activity, originating from the high photocatalytic efficiency of phenolic resins, provide an innovative material platform for environmental and biomedical applications.








Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light&#8208;driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible&#8208;light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light&#8208;driven nanomotors. Among them, the m&#8208;aminophenol&#8208;formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine&#8208;quinoid structure with a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (1.90&#160;eV). These nanomotors feature broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H2O2 concentration, enabling precise control over in&#8208;plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light&#8208;driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.

Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light-driven nanomotors. Among them, the &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-aminophenol-formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine-quinoid structure with a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (1.90&#160;eV). These nanomotors feature broad-spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, enabling precise control over in-plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Karenia mikimotoi&lt;/i&gt; under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light-driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homoleptic and Heteroleptic Polyoxotungstate&#8211;Organic Cages for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heteroleptic polyoxometalate&#8211;organic cages have been constructed and shown to be efficient catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. The construction and transformation between {SiW9Ni4}&#8208;based homoleptic and heteroleptic cages may be rationalized by the analyses of bite angles, which are indicative of cage strains and hence their relative thermodynamic stability.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic cages with polyoxometalate (POM) clusters as nodes are an emerging frontier of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, but they have been limited to homoleptic cages, which are composed of only one type of organic ligands. We show here that, in the construction of POM&#8211;organic cages with Keggin&#8208;type {SiW9Ni4} cluster nodes, introducing a secondary ligand may change the self&#8208;assembly processes in two distinct ways: by coordination or as supramolecular templates. The use of a tetracarboxylate panel LC, in complementary to a bent dicarboxylate linker (LA or LB), allows the integrative self&#8208;sorting to give heteroleptic coordination cages POM8LA/B4LC4 (3 or 4) that are otherwise not accessible through either ligand alone. The aromatic LC can also alter the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process by acting as a non&#8208;coordinating template, transforming a coordinatively frustrated, homoleptic cage POM8LD6 (5) to POM8LD5 (6). These octa&#8208;Keggin cages were all shown to be efficient molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production; for 4, in particular, an apparent turnover number of 4910 was achieved in 5&#160;h under minimally optimized conditions. Mechanistic studies confirmed the existence of both reductive and oxidative quenching processes, with the former being dominant.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Feglymycin Using Umpolung Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A total synthesis of the antiviral feglymycin is described, leveraging enantioselective umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS). The strategic use of UmAS to prepare the aryl glycine&#8208;rich tridecapeptide reduced hazardous amide coupling agents by 50%, and replaced asymmetric synthesis reliant on toxic transition metals by organocatalysis.








Abstract
The preparation of peptidic molecules is a mainstay of synthesis, creating new tools that advance chemical biology, catalysis, and drug discovery. Despite the wide adoption of methods for amide synthesis based on electrophilic acyl transfer reactions, significant limitations remain that restrict access to chemical space and plague accessible peptides with imperfect conservation of stereochemical information. These problems persist in key applications (i.e., solid phase peptide synthesis) where reagent excess can be used to drive maximal yield. As a general tactic, however, use of excess coupling agents that are often hazardous is unsustainable. Here we report the synthesis of the antiviral tridecapeptide feglymycin where half of the amides are formed using umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS) to replace conventional amide synthesis. Reliance on UmAS further allowed the enantioselective synthesis of each noncanonical residue from an inexpensive aldehyde. As a result, the most process&#8208;intensive components were simplified to a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalyst and potassium iodide/urea&#183;hydrogen peroxide (KI/UHP). This solution&#8208;phase total synthesis illustrates the harmonious, strategic application of complementary amide synthesis methods, and it serves as a touchstone for the green synthesis of peptides composed of noncanonical amino amides.

         <title>Simultaneous Modulation of Mesoporosity and Al Siting for Superior Performance Zeolite Catalyst in Ethylene Dehydroaromatization to Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables the construction of hierarchical zeolites with selective removal of &#8764;60% of channel&#8208;located Al, revealing that Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) at channel intersections exhibit a TOF of 516 h&#8722;1, 13 times higher than those within the channels. This leads to a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in ethylene conversion turnover frequency (TOF), enhanced aromatic selectivity, and superior stability at 973 K.








Abstract
Porosity and Al siting are key levers for optimizing zeolite catalysts, yet they are often addressed independently due to the lack of effective integrated tuning strategies. Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (ZF) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al&#8208;rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (ZP). Remarkably, &#8764;60% of the framework channels&#8217; Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections&#8217; Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), ZF exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than ZP during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site&#8208;specific 31P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h&#8722;1, which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h&#8722;1). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to ZP. These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high&#8208;performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Protein Engineering Enable Efficient, Scalable Production of Teleocidin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we reported a scalable chemoenzymatic platform enabling efficient and divergent synthesis of 13 structurally diverse teleocidin B congeners and derivatives (2&#8211;14). Meanwhile, we validated its industrial scalability through pilot&#8208;scale fermentations, yielding 430&#160;mg indolactam V (2), 170&#160;mg teleocidin A1 (9), and 300&#160;mg of teleocidin derivatives (12, 13, and 14). 








Abstract
Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), a class of bioactive natural products, are highly valued in drug development for their unique pharmacological activities. Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self&#8208;sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1. Additionally, we established a dual&#8208;cell factory co&#8208;expressing engineered hMAT2A&#8208;TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1. Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant Escherichia coli system's scalability, producing 430&#160;mg indolactam V, 170&#160;mg teleocidin A1, and 300&#160;mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.

Meanwhile, we validated its industrial scalability through pilot-scale fermentations, yielding 430&#160;mg indolactam V (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), 170&#160;mg teleocidin A1 (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;), and 300&#160;mg of teleocidin derivatives (&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;). 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), a class of bioactive natural products, are highly valued in drug development for their unique pharmacological activities. Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self-sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, we established a dual-cell factory co-expressing engineered hMAT2A-TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; system's scalability, producing 430&#160;mg indolactam V, 170&#160;mg teleocidin A1, and 300&#160;mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dots&#8208;Induced Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Traps in RHO Zeolite: Mechanistic Insights and Superior Flue Gas Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) were introduced into RHO zeolite to construct hydrogen&#8208;bonding traps, which can selectively capture and condense CO2 to enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity during dynamic separation process and promote the CO2/N2 separation.








Abstract
Zeolites stand out as promising materials for flue gas separation, however, it poses a significant challenge to conduct pore interior modifications to improve the separation performance. Herein, we present a novel strategy for constructing hydrogen&#8208;bonding traps in a small&#8208;pore RHO zeolite by embedding carbon dots (CDs), thereby to regulate pore microenvironment and enhance the separation ability of CO2/N2. The incorporation of CDs into the RHO zeolite is realized via a straightforward calcination process, which endows the zeolite with the defect sites rich in hydroxyl groups that easily form hydrogen bonds with CDs. Along with 1H&#8208;1H DQ&#8208;SQ experiments, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations, the unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding traps are unraveled, which can selectively capture and concentrate CO2. As a result, the CDs&#8208;containing zeolite (R&#8208;500) showcases exceptional performance in terms of both CO2 adsorption (90.40 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 298K and 1&#160;bar) and CO2/N2 (15/85) separation (IAST selectivity of 1063.6). Strikingly, a superior CO2 adsorption with a capacity of 42.9 cm3 g&#8722;1 is achieved in the dynamic separation process (CO2/N2 15/85). The facile synthesis and impressive separation performance of R&#8208;500 provides a promising solution for industrial scale CO2/N2 separation in flue gas.

         <title>PCR&#8208;Free Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis on Repetitive Sequences Using Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Assisted Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Nicking by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), in which DNAzymes are used to sequence&#8208;specifically nick or cleave superhelical plasmids, with help from assisting single&#8208;stranded DNAs. The DANDA system can be used for PCR&#8208;free site&#8208;directed mutagenesis on plasmids to create mutations on difficult targets such as repetitive sequences.








Abstract
Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (SDM) is a key driver for many biochemical investigations and biotechnological applications. Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR&#8208;free SDM method that uses DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double&#8208;stranded DNA, we employed single&#8208;stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double&#8208;stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target&#8208;specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR&#8208;incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost&#8208;effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.

         <title>A Photoregulated Peptidase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule light&#8208;activated peptidase (SLAP) enzyme mimic featuring a glucose&#8208;linked photoswitch&#8208;imidazole triad has been created, where the peptidase activity can be controlled by light by tuning the distance between the basic imidazole residue, the reaction center, and the sugar moiety. The cis&#8208;isomer exhibited a significant increase in catalytic activity compared to its trans&#8208;counterpart.








Abstract
Proteases and peptidases play crucial roles in numerous biological processes. These enzymes bind to protein substrates and hydrolyze peptide bonds, resulting in the cleavage of proteins and peptides into smaller fragments. This study reports on a small&#8208;molecule light activated peptidase (SLAP) enzyme mimic featuring a glucose&#8208;linked photoswitch&#8208;imidazole triad, where peptidase activity can be controlled by light by tuning the distance between the basic imidazole residue, the reaction center, and the sugar moiety, that provides a binding site for the substrate and also takes a role in stabilizing the transition state. The cis isomer exhibited a &#8764;300&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to its inactive trans counterpart with a model amide&#8208;substrate. Catalytic hydrolysis was studied with small molecules, FRET&#8208;based substrates, and large cellular proteins. The light&#8208;controlled peptidase activity opens new possibilities for protein degradation in biological systems.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution From Ultra&#8208;Stable Cu&#8208;Zr/Hf Heterobimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering and facet engineering were concurrently employed to develop a series of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free heterobimetallic MOFs (M&#8208;BCA&#8208;M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu+, M'&#160;=&#160;Zr4+ or Hf4+) for record&#8208;high photocatalytic hydrogen production in pristine MOFs.

Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting for hydrogen production over metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is particularly attractive yet remains a challenge. Here, we report a series of ultra&#8208;stable heterobimetallic MOFs (M&#8208;BCA&#8208;M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu+, M&#8242;&#160;=&#160;Zr4+ or Hf4+) for photocatalytic hydrogen production, in which, the Cu(I) species act as the active center, whereas Zr(IV)/Hf(IV) plays an essential role in stabilizing the framework. Uniform MOF crystals with distinct morphologies were obtained, showing a rare crystal facet&#8208;dependent photocatalytic behavior. The octahedral MOF crystals denoted as Cu&#8208;BCA&#8208;Hf&#8208;O with the exposure of only {101} and {011} facets exhibit a record&#8208;high hydrogen production rate (49825.71&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among pristine MOF photocatalysts. The exceptional performance of Cu&#8208;BCA&#8208;Hf&#8208;O can be primarily attributed to its superior photogenerated carrier transfer ability and abundant active sites exposed on the crystal surface. This study provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the coordination regulation and morphology control of MOFs for highly efficient photocatalysis, highlighting the promising future of pristine MOF photocatalysts.

Here, we report a series of ultra-stable heterobimetallic MOFs (M-BCA-M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, M&#8242;&#160;=&#160;Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; or Hf&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;) for photocatalytic hydrogen production, in which, the Cu(I) species act as the active center, whereas Zr(IV)/Hf(IV) plays an essential role in stabilizing the framework. Uniform MOF crystals with distinct morphologies were obtained, showing a rare crystal facet-dependent photocatalytic behavior. The octahedral MOF crystals denoted as Cu-BCA-Hf-O with the exposure of only {101} and {011} facets exhibit a record-high hydrogen production rate (49825.71&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) among pristine MOF photocatalysts. The exceptional performance of Cu-BCA-Hf-O can be primarily attributed to its superior photogenerated carrier transfer ability and abundant active sites exposed on the crystal surface. This study provides molecular-level insights into the coordination regulation and morphology control of MOFs for highly efficient photocatalysis, highlighting the promising future of pristine MOF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#949;&#8208;Lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;C Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective synthesis of &#949;&#8208;lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#9472;C bond activation of non&#8208;activated aminocyclopropanes has been developed. This method not only represents an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy method for chiral &#949;&#8208;lactam synthesis via an enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation process but also set up a new strategy for enantioselective transformation of dialkyl&#8208;substituted transition&#8208;metal intermediates.








Abstract
&#949;&#8208;Lactams are important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry, but a fully enantioselective synthesis without byproduct formation represents a challenge that has attracted significant research interest. Herein, we report an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic synthesis of chiral &#949;&#8208;lactams via Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#9472;C bond activation of aminocyclopropanes. The catalytic C&#9472;C bond activation enables a directed generation of chiral rhodacyclobutanes that circumvents &#946;&#8208;hydride decomposition. Subsequent enantioselective cycloaddition of the alkene unit and then fragmentation generates chiral &#949;&#8208;lactams. A range of enantioenriched &#949;&#8208;lactams have been obtained with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities, which can undergo several stereospecific transformations. Theoretical calculations are performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity control.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Photocatalyzed Radical Anellation of Nitroalkanes with Alkenes or Alkynes for the Synthesis of Isoxazolines and Isoxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a Cu(II)&#8208;photocatalyzed method that employs commercially available nitroalkanes for the synthesis of isoxazolines and isoxazoles from alkenes and alkynes, respectively. Detailed mechanistic investigations revealed that the broad substrate scope, encompassing both activated and unactivated alkenes and alkynes, is attributable to a radical pathway involving &#945;&#8208;nitro alkyl radicals.








Abstract
The visible light&#8208;mediated copper(II)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step synthesis of isoxazolines and isoxazoles from readily available ethyl nitroacetate or phenyl nitromethane is reported. The developed protocol eliminates the need for substrate preactivation or additives, and offers an extensive scope of activated and unactivated alkenes and alkynes as coupling partners. Key intermediates for this formal [3&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition are &#945;&#8208;nitro radicals generated via photoinduced single&#8208;electron oxidation of nitronates, contrasting the generation of such radicals via Cu(I)&#8208;photocatalysis by a reductive pathway, which shows a different reaction pattern in the coupling with alkenes.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit Effects in a Thallium Borohydride Stabilized by Coordination to Bis(diisopropylamino)Cyclopropenylidene (BAC)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong donor ability of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) helps stabilize the first reported thallium borohydride, [Tl(BAC)(&#956;&#8208;H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN)]2 ([H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9&#8208;boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane). According to density functional theory, its hydride resonance is calculated to exhibit a 3.9 downfield shift due to spin&#8211;orbit (SO) effects from the adjacent Tl center. This SO shift is evidence for Tl(6p)&#8208;H(1s) orbital mixing.








Abstract
Reaction of Tl(OTf) with 2 equiv of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene (BAC) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)2(OTf)] (1) in moderate yields. Subsequent reaction of 1 with [K][H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN] ([H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN]&#8722;&#160;=&#160;dihydrido 9&#8208;boratabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) in THF results in formation of [Tl(BAC)(&#956;&#8208;H2&#8208;9&#8208;BBN)]2 (3), also in moderate yield. Complex 3 is the first reported thallium borohydride. We attribute its thermal stability to the strong donor ability of the BAC co&#8208;ligand. Both 1 and 3 exhibit trigonal pyramidal geometries about Tl+ in the solid&#8208;state, indicative of the presence of stereochemically active lone pairs. The hydride environment in 3 is calculated to exhibit a 3.9&#160;ppm downfield shift attributed to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the adjacent Tl center.

         <title>Ketenimine Multicomponent Strategy for Multifaceted Amidine Functionalization of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed multicomponent strategy compatible with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis leverages ketenimines for the direct installation of &#948;/&#949;&#8208;amidine motifs into peptides. This method unlocks a range of on&#8208;resin transformations, including side chain editing, macrocyclization, drug/fluorophore/functional&#8208;scaffold conjugation, and aromatic group insertion, streamlining access to functionally enhanced peptide architectures.








Abstract
The amidine group and its derivatives serve as proteolytically stable bioisosteres of the peptide bond, and their selective incorporation into peptides attributes significant chemical and biological features. This study introduces an efficient synthesis of amidine&#8208;containing peptides by a copper&#8208;catalyzed, solid&#8208;phase&#8208;compatible multicomponent reaction (MCR), leveraging ketenimine intermediates that are generated in situ. Through the reaction of sulfonyl azides with terminal alkynes and a wide variety of amines, we establish the robust on&#8208;resin synthesis of &#948;/&#949;&#8208;amidine amino acids, arginine isologues, fluorescently labeled peptides, drug&#8208;peptide hybrids, and PEGylated derivatives. This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform. Our results underscore the synthetic versatility and functional applicability of ketenimine&#8208;based MCRs for advanced peptide modification, expanding the chemical space of peptide medicinal chemistry and therapeutics.

         <title>Heterointerface Anchored Ir with Localized Strong Orbital Coupling for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The validity of strong anchoring strategies via heterophase homojunction is uncovered in Ir&#8208;supported catalysts. These localized strong anchoring dramatically improves the operational stability through the controlled microscopic bonding enhancement, and the increased micro&#8208;support interaction generated by the heterointerface optimizes the reactivities of key intermediate species, thus promoting efficient and durable water electrolysis.








Abstract
The imperative to minimize iridium usage in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) process presents a pivotal challenge for hydrogen economy deployment, while inherent destabilization of iridium (Ir) active sites under corrosive operational conditions, originating from insufficient Ir bonding strength, remains a fundamental barrier. Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface&#8208;engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb&#8208;TiO2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic&#8208;scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir&#9472;Osupport bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity&#8208;stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrOx/m&#8208;Nb&#8208;TiO2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mgIr cm&#8722;2), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72&#160;V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm&#8722;2, coupled with unprecedented durability with &lt;1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.

         <title>A Molecular Staircase Built from Hydrazide&#8208;Linked Pyridines as an Artificial Proton Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazide&#8208;bridged pyridine moieties have been used to generate a staircase&#8208;shaped artificial proton channel that exhibits excellent proton transport performance. The proton channel shows an EC&#8325;&#8320; value of 0.33 mol% relative to lipids while demonstrating exceptional selectivity over Na&#8314; and K&#8314; ions, with selectivity values of 90.5 and 160.3, respectively.








Abstract
Artificial proton channels exhibiting high selectivity remain largely unexplored, with only two such systems recently reported. Inspired by the DNA duplex's iconic helical structure, we present here a novel strategy for designing a molecular&#8208;scale staircase configuration. The resulting molecular staircase (MS), predominantly linear in shape, consists of pyridine units linked by hydrazide groups, with backbone rigidity enhanced by intramolecular H&#8208;bonding. This MS incorporates up to five proton&#8208;transporting motifs, demonstrating remarkable efficacy as a proton&#8208;conducting channel within lipid bilayer membranes. Our findings indicate that the MS exhibits high proton transport activity (EC50 of 0.31&#160;mol%, relative to lipids) and significant selectivity for protons, with selectivity values of 160.3 for K+, 90.5 for Na+, and 3.5 for Cl&#8315;. These results underscore the potential of the MS and its variants as a highly selective and efficient proton channel, advancing the field of artificial ion transport systems.

         <title>Hinge&#8208;Like Mechanochromic Mechanophores Based on [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hinge&#8208;like supramolecular mechanophores utilizing [2.2]paracyclophane have been developed. In the force&#8208;free state, the rigid [2.2]paracyclophane forces two luminophores into proximity, leading to excimer&#8208;dominant photoluminescence. Stretching the polyurethane films into which the mechanophores are covalently incorporated results in the structures of the mechanophores changing to more open forms, which leads to monomer&#8208;dominant emission being observed.








Abstract
A hinge&#8208;like supramolecular mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and two excimer&#8208;forming 1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophores is presented. Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue&#8211;green monomer&#8208;dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress&#8211;strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge&#8208;like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.

         <title>Tailoring a Fast Ion&#8208;Conducting Substrate with Competitive Adsorption for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium/Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a Li15Si4/Li3N&#8208;based 3D host enables competitive adsorption at dual&#8208;phase interfaces, dynamically reconstructing the solvation sheath and reducing Li+ desolvation barriers by 33%. The integrated design promotes uniform ion transport, suppresses polarization, and achieves 5000&#160;h symmetric cycling and 107% capacity retention over 2000 cycles in full cells, offering a new strategy for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes.








Abstract
The desolvation behavior of Li+ is widely regarded as primarily governed by the electrolyte composition, while the dynamic decoupling mechanism between the electrode interface and solvation structure has received limited attention. Herein, a competitive adsorption&#8208;driven, fast&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting host was innovatively developed based on the Li15Si4/Li3N microrods. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was revealed for the first time that the dual&#8208;phase interface exhibits competitive adsorption interactions with solvent molecules and anions within the solvation sheath. This unique interfacial interaction triggers dynamic reconstruction of the solvation structure at the interface, significantly reducing the Li+ desolvation barrier by 33%. Benefiting from the integration of these multifunctional advantages, the symmetric cell delivers an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of over 5000 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 with an exceptionally low overpotential of 13 mV. Moreover, the full cell coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes achieves an impressive cycling stability of 2000 cycles at 5 C, with a capacity retention of 107%. This work unveils a substrate&#8208;mediated solvation structure decoupling mechanism, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes with 3D architectures.

         <title>Electrochemical Alkyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer on Cu(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(111) nanosheets enable highly selective electrocatalytic alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) via a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism, bypassing conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways. The catalyst delivers&#160;&gt;&#160;98% selectivity and efficiently removes trace alkyne impurities from alkene feedstocks. Mechanistic studies reveal that planar intermediates and linearly hydrogen&#8208;bonded interfacial water synergistically suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation during PCET&#8208;mediated EASH.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) powered by renewable electricity using water as a hydrogen donor provides a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Cu(111) nanosheets enable highly selective electrocatalytic alkyne semi-hydrogenation (EASH) via a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism, bypassing conventional hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways. The catalyst delivers&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;98% selectivity and efficiently removes trace alkyne impurities from alkene feedstocks. Mechanistic studies reveal that planar intermediates and linearly hydrogen-bonded interfacial water synergistically suppress over-hydrogenation during PCET-mediated EASH.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic alkyne semi-hydrogenation (EASH) powered by renewable electricity using water as a hydrogen donor provides a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalysis. However, the current EASH systems predominantly follow hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways, which are prone to over-hydrogenation and at the same time compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we report a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism enabled on Cu(111) surface for highly efficient and selective EASH. Well-defined two-dimensional Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) facets achieve&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;98% selectivity for electrochemical semi-hydrogenation of 4-aminophenylacetylene to 4-vinylphenylamine in a membrane electrode assembly reactor.

In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, during the PCET-mediated EASH, the covalent adsorption of alkynes and their conversion to weakly bound planar intermediates facilitate the EASH process and suppress over-hydrogenation. Interfacial K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-structured and linearly hydrogen-bonded water species further enhance EASH selectivity via proton supply and steric modulation.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Offering Zero&#8208;Order Sulfur Redox Kinetics for High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that asymmetric coordination in Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts profoundly alters sulfur redox kinetics. The Ni&#8208;NPG elevates the Ni d&#8208;band center, facilitates bidentate Li2S4 adsorption, and shifts the sulfur redox reaction to zero&#8208;order kinetics, enabling a concurrent conversion pathway. This asymmetric&#8208;coordinated metal center moves the rate&#8208;determining step from the difficult solid&#8208;solid conversion (Li2S2 &#8594; Li2S) to a more favorable liquid&#8208;solid transformation (Li2S4 &#8594; Li2S2), thereby lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Accelerating the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics through electrocatalysis has been regarded as one of the key factors to achieve Li&#8211;S batteries of cell&#8208;level energy densities exceeding 600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Though single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), typically with symmetric M&#8208;N4 coordination structures have demonstrated attractive electrocatalytic performance in Li&#8211;S batteries, herein we discovered that an asymmetric&#8208;coordinated metal center distinctly shifts sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics&#8212;from first&#8208;order (concentration&#8208;dependent) behavior in the symmetric&#8208;coordinated SACs&#8212;to zero&#8208;order (surface&#8208;saturated) kinetics, highlighting fundamentally altered reaction pathways, leading to a concurrent polysulfide conversion. Experimental and theoretical studies on the Ni atom&#8208;based SACs showed that symmetry breaking raises the Ni d&#8208;band center, enabling a monodentate&#8208;to&#8208;bidentate Li2S4 adsorption transition, which strengthens polysulfide adsorption and shifts the rate&#8208;limiting step from sluggish solid&#8208;solid transformation (Li2S2 &#8594; Li2S) to a more favorable liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2S4 &#8594; Li2S2), effectively lowering the overall energy barrier of the SRR process. Consequently, Li&#8211;S cells employing Ni&#8208;NPG, a SACs with asymmetric Ni&#8208;N3P1 coordination, achieved a specific capacity of 877 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4&#160;C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the cell retained 92% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2&#160;C, outperforming conventional SACs with symmetric coordination structures.

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables Over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based isomeric Lewis bases are designed to provide dual functionality in perovskite solar cells by enabling deep&#8208;level defects passivation and efficient charge extraction. This synergy reduces interfacial recombination losses, resulting in improved device efficiency and operational stability. Devices incorporating with planar configure molecule show consistent performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocols, demonstrating their effectiveness in long&#8208;term applications.








Abstract
Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theoretical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT&#8208;modified n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial&#8208;related issues for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Pulsed Electrocatalysis Driven Efficient Ammonia Synthesis by Facilitating *NOOH Formation and Balancing *H Supply</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pulsed electrocatalysis, a Janus Cu@Co/NC catalyst achieves highly efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by facilitating *NOOH formation and balancing *H supply. Specifically, the Cu sites can activate NO3&#8722; at low overpotentials, while the Co sites can facilitate *NOOH formation with sufficient *H provided by the Co sites at high overpotentials.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction emerges as a promising approach for ammonia generation; however, its efficiency is hindered by the sluggish hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates and limited active hydrogen supply at constant applied potentials. Driven by the pulsed electrocatalysis, in this work, efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion is realized by facilitating *NOOH formation and balancing *H supply on a Janus Cu@Co/NC electrocatalyst. In detail, the Cu sites could activate NO3&#8722; at low overpotentials, while the Co sites could facilitate *NOOH formation with sufficient *H provided by the Co sites at high overpotentials. Promoted by the pulsed electrocatalysis technique, a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 98.32% with NH3 yield rate of 12.75 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 is attained, and the scaled&#8208;up pulsed electrosynthesis at industrial current densities is also achieved. This work underlines the feasibility of pulsed electrolysis for regulating intermediate hydrogenation, offering a promising approach for the synthesis of ammonia or other important chemicals.

To address the escalating global water shortage, hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI) offers a cost&#8208;effective desalination approach dependent on advanced electrode materials. We developed a redox&#8208;active COF&#8208;based anode that achieved exceptional chloride removal (up to 89&#160;mg g&#8722;1) with high selectivity, stability, and the highest reported performance for COF&#8208;based HCDI systems.








Abstract
To prevent a global water shortage crisis, we must innovate to desalinate seawater. Hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI), an energy&#8208;efficient desalination method, depends on electrode materials. Removing chloride ions (Cl&#8722;), a key salinity factor, is vital for balanced electrode capacity. Yet, efforts focus mainly on cathode materials for Na+ capture, limiting the progress of electrochemical desalination. Herein, we have developed a covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based redox&#8208;active anode material with excellent chemical stability and unique pseudocapacitive behavior. In the HCDI cell, the rationally designed material showed a remarkable chloride ion removal capacity (Cl&#8208;RC) of 71.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in 1300&#160;ppm saline solution with a noteworthy removal capacity rate (Cl&#8722; RCR) of 1.85&#160;mg g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, while maintaining 98.7% capacity retention over 30 cycles. Under optimized conditions, the COF electrode displayed a high selectivity toward Cl&#8722; over other anions present in real&#8208;seawater samples with Cl&#8208;RC of 89&#160;mg g&#8722;1, implying its practical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a purposefully functionalized COF serving as an anode in HCDI, highlighting the promising role of COFs in advancing capacitive deionization technologies.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Dissolution Relay for Deep Progression of Active Sites Toward Efficient and Ultralong&#8208;Life Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering competitive bonding in the medium&#8208;entropy NiCoCu hydroxides, we provide theoretical and experimental understandings of how the Cu/Co dual&#8208;cation dissolution relay happens for initiating deep activation of the active network. The resulting ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) &#947;&#8208;oxyhydroxide nanodomains enable in situ &#8220;self&#8208;rescue&#8221; of reactivity, demonstrating a considerable capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 after 150&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides serve as efficient aqueous cathode materials but suffer from the challenge of structure degradation during long&#8208;term cycling applications. Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100&#160;000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium&#8208;entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium&#8208;entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p&#8208;band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual&#8208;cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As&#8208;incorporated Co vacancies favor the &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;&#947; phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (&#8764;1.9&#160;nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 was achieved after 150&#160;000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiCo&#8208;based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Recyclable Biohybrid Polymer Networks Using Whole Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical method is developed to transform raw biomass, such as whole&#8208;cell algae,&#160;into strong and ductile plastics by combining it with synthetic components. These biohybrid materials can be adapted, remolded, or depolymerized over multiple cycles due to the underlying dynamic covalent polymer network.








Abstract
Whole&#8208;plant biomass from non&#8208;agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole&#8208;cell spirulina, a green&#8208;blue algae, into robust biohybrid algae&#8208;polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The biohybrid algae&#8208;based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all&#8208;synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.

         <title>Restructured Three&#8208;Coordinated Ni&#9472;Se Catalytic Sites for Enhanced Cross&#8208;Condensation of Methanol and Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;doping reconstructs the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites that effectively catalyze MeOH and EtOH conversion to aldehyde intermediates while suppressing further decomposition, thus significantly promoting their cross&#8208;condensation to C5+ higher alcohols.








Abstract
The cross&#8208;condensation of methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) offers a promising, carbon&#8208;neutral pathway for the production of higher alcohols (HAS) from both CO2 and biomass resources. However, this process is often hampered by the low efficiency of C5+ alcohol (C5+OH) synthesis, high catalyst production costs, and limited water tolerance. Here, we report for the first time a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance Ni&#8208;based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C5+OH) in the cross&#8208;condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross&#8208;condensation to C5+OH.

         <dc:description>
Bioisosteric replacement of ketones with 3D motifs (oxetanes/azetidines) unlocks novel chemical space with enhanced pharmacokinetics. Asymmetric synthesis of stereocenters near these strained 3D frameworks remains underdeveloped. Here, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling of aldehydes/heterocyclic alkenes delivering &#945;&#8208;hydroxy bioisosteres was reported, which enables broad tolerance and offers a platform for stereodefined bioisosteres.








Abstract
Bioisosteric replacement of ketones with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motifs, such as oxetanes and azetidines, has emerged as a powerful tool in molecular design, enabling access to novel chemical space with improved pharmacokinetic profiles. However, general methods for the asymmetric synthesis of stereocenters adjacent to these strained, 3D frameworks remain scarce. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective reductive cross&#8208;coupling between aldehydes and four&#8208;membered heterocyclic alkenes to construct &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones bioisosteres with high efficiency and selectivity. Guided by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, the reaction proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, affording enantioenriched products in yields of up to 94% and an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of 99.8:0.2. The protocol is particularly amenable to the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy difluoromethylene alkanes. Mechanistic investigations revealed how strain&#8208;enabled reactivity and ligand control govern chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated through gram&#8208;scale preparation and diverse downstream derivatizations, offering a versatile platform for accessing previously elusive classes of stereodefined bioisosteres.

&lt;p&gt;Bioisosteric replacement of ketones with 3D motifs (oxetanes/azetidines) unlocks novel chemical space with enhanced pharmacokinetics. Asymmetric synthesis of stereocenters near these strained 3D frameworks remains underdeveloped. Here, a nickel-catalyzed enantioselective coupling of aldehydes/heterocyclic alkenes delivering &#945;-hydroxy bioisosteres was reported, which enables broad tolerance and offers a platform for stereodefined bioisosteres.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioisosteric replacement of ketones with three-dimensional (3D) motifs, such as oxetanes and azetidines, has emerged as a powerful tool in molecular design, enabling access to novel chemical space with improved pharmacokinetic profiles. However, general methods for the asymmetric synthesis of stereocenters adjacent to these strained, 3D frameworks remain scarce. Here, we report a nickel-catalyzed, enantioselective reductive cross-coupling between aldehydes and four-membered heterocyclic alkenes to construct &#945;-hydroxy ketones bioisosteres with high efficiency and selectivity. Guided by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, the reaction proceeds with broad functional group tolerance, affording enantioenriched products in yields of up to 94% and an enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) of 99.8:0.2. The protocol is particularly amenable to the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;-hydroxy difluoromethylene alkanes. Mechanistic investigations revealed how strain-enabled reactivity and ligand control govern chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated through gram-scale preparation and diverse downstream derivatizations, offering a versatile platform for accessing previously elusive classes of stereodefined bioisosteres.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

N&#8208;Unprotected &#945;&#8208;amino acids and &#947;&#8208;lactams were successfully synthesized through the coupling of readily available glycine esters with four distinct electrophiles under half&#8208;sandwich chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium aldehyde catalysis. The metal&#8208;centered chirality serves as a crucial element for asymmetric induction.








Abstract
Chiral aldehyde catalysis has emerged as an efficient and step&#8208;economical protocol for constructing unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and related esters. Herein, we report the application of a half&#8208;sandwich chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium complex featuring an aldehyde group as a versatile asymmetric catalyst with remarkably broad scope. Direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#9472;H functionalization of N&#8208;unprotected glycine esters with four types of electrophiles (51 examples, all&#160;&gt;91% ee) has been successfully realized for accessing structurally diverse unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and successful catalyst recovery underscored the practicability and application potential of the present asymmetric aldehyde catalysis.

         <title>A Bambusuril Receptor Binds Charge Diffuse Anions in Water at Picomolar Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of a bambusuril macrocycle with unprecedented binding affinity for several charge diffuse anions, including iodide, perchlorate, nitrate, and perrhenate, in neutral phosphate buffer is reported. The macrocycle exhibits selectivity for charge diffuse over charge dense anions exceeding seven orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Anionic pollutants are widespread in the environment and pose risks to human health. Due to the typically low concentrations of these species, the development of efficient receptors for their detection and removal from aqueous solutions is highly desirable. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a bambusuril receptor with markedly enhanced anion&#8208;binding affinity in water, achieved by introducing trifluoromethyl electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The resulting fluorinated receptor is, to date, the most potent known receptor for several charge diffuse anions in aqueous media. The most stable 1:1 host&#8211;guest complex in water was observed with iodide, exhibiting a relative dissociation constant of 59&#160;pM. This complex is over three orders of magnitude more stable than any previously reported complex between an artificial receptor and inorganic anion in water.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Stable Porous Organic Salts via Suppressed Proton Integration Using Fluorinated Tetrazole Tectons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts featuring hydrophobic channels and minimal hydrogen bonding were constructed using a fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra&#8208;substituted imidazole precursor lacking active protons as the base. These materials exhibited exceptional robustness and structural integrity under both aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions, maintaining their stacking mode and crystal structure even at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid&#8211;base neutralization (e.g., &#9472;SO&#8323;H and &#9472;NH&#8322;) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water&#8208;lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra&#8208;substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single&#8208;crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation&#8211;anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions is confirmed by X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C&#8211;F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites. The approach developed herein further pushes the boundary of POS materials to withstand both aqueous and water&#8208;lean conditions.

         <title>Structural Insights Into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we found that O vacancies play a critical role in governing the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition during the synthesis process of sodium layered cathode materials. These structural insights broaden synthesis strategies and enhance practical feasibility. As a result of the expanded Mn redox range and the stabilization of oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the synthesized P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrates prominent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performances of layered cathodes&#160;for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P&#8242;2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn&#8208;valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P&#8242;2&#8211;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P&#8242;2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over &#8764;40&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C, maintaining &#8764;93&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%. This research significantly advances the comprehension of both synthesis mechanism and electrochemical properties optimization mechanisms of P&#8242;2 phase materials, offering a pragmatic strategy for elevating the performance of SIB materials.

         <title>Electron/Proton Transport Engineering in Acylhydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acylhydrazone&#8208;linked COF, COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH, integrates benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups to enhance the electron donor&#8208;acceptor effect, optimize light absorption and O2/H2O adsorption, and particularly improve proton transfer. This synergy boosts charge separation and surface reactions, achieving record high H2O2 production of 10.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 2.12%.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a vital industrial chemical extensively utilized in textiles, pharmaceuticals, and disinfection. Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic technology depending on photocatalysts with matched energy band structure for simultaneously driving both O2 reduction and water oxidation half&#8208;reactions, without necessary use of any sacrificial agent, enables green H2O2 synthesis from O2 and/or H2O, offering a low&#8208;energy and simple&#8208;operation process without secondary pollution while avoiding safety and environmental risk of conventional methods. Herein, a novel acylhydrazone&#8208;linked 2D COF, COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH, was prepared from benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b':5,6&#8208;b'']trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxysuccinohydrazide. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that introduction of benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups enhances the electron donor&#8208;acceptor effect in COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH, optimizes the light&#8208;harvesting and adsorption capacities to O2 and H2O, and particularly enables efficient proton transfer, thereby synergistically improving photogenerated charge carrier separation and surface reaction efficiency. Consequently, COF&#8208;S&#8208;OH achieves an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 10.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 2.1%, superior to all the thus far reported photocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis. This work underscores the critical importance of carrier separation, active site, and proton supply in photocatalytic H2O2 generation, providing guidance for designing and fabricating next&#8208;generation photocatalysts.

         <title>Electro&#8208;responsive Tri&#8208;state Switch in Supramolecular Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

TOC: First demonstration of an electroresponsive multistable switch in a supramolecular circuit showing three distinct conductance states under bias voltages without chemical additives, enabling richer logic encoding, achieving an exceptional switching ratio of approximately 1.25&#215;103 (one of the highest reported to date), and revealing the mechanism for the formation of molecular trimer junctions promoted by the applied electrical field.








Abstract
Efficiently manipulating charge transport at the molecular level is critical to developing multifunctional and responsive molecular electronic devices. Here, we report the first electroresponsive tristate switch in a supramolecular circuit, overcoming the binary limitation and enabling richer logic encoding, governed solely by a bias voltage (electric field). At low electric fields, p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules exhibit a high&#8208;conductance state, which transitions successively to two distinct low&#8208;conductance states as the external electric field strength increases. This precise control of supramolecular junctions through electric field manipulation achieved an on/off ratio GH/GL of &#8764;1.25&#215;103, which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the intrinsic mechanism for the observation, i.e., electric field promoting the formation of trimer supramolecular junctions leads to the striking on/off ratio. These findings provide new insights into the design of molecular circuits with tunable conductance, paving a way for the design of molecular computation, memory devices, and sensors.

         <title>Insight into how PETase Functions at the Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface and an Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>

Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable plastic recycling. This study systematically elucidates the catalytic pathway of PET biodegradation, from enzyme adsorption and substrate recognition to ester bond cleavage. A rational enzyme design principle is proposed to balance catalytic activity and stability, providing guidelines for developing efficient plastic&#8208;degrading biocatalysts.








Abstract
Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has garnered considerable interest in plastic recycling efforts. However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase&#8208;catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid&#8208;liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET&#8208;binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes.

         <title>Unraveling the Mode of Action of a Neuron&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Probe, NeuO: Intracellular Phosphorylation Through PAK6 Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NeuO, a small molecule fluorescent probe, selectively stains live neurons across species. Despite wide use and commercial availability, its neuron&#8208;specific mechanism has remained elusive. This work shows that NeuO is phosphorylated intracellularly by the kinase PAK6. This phosphorylation enhances fluorescence and probe accumulation in neurons.








Abstract
NeuO is an intriguing molecular probe capable of selectively labeling live neurons within a heterogeneous population of brain cells. The precise mechanism responsible for this neuronal labeling has remained a longstanding enigma. We investigated four potential mechanisms underlying NeuO's fluorescence, including its interaction with neuronal proteins, transportation into neurons, export from glial cells, and structural alterations within neurons. Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.

In this study, we present the first example of manganese&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent hydroalkoxylation of alkynylnitriles, accessing both (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;alkoxyvinylnitriles from the same set of starting materials. This method features high functional group tolerance and outstanding chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity, highlighting the potential of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation in the selective functionalization of unsaturated compounds.








Abstract
Precise stereocontrol over functionalized alkenes remains a central challenge in organic synthesis. In particular, catalytic methods enabling flexible and stereodivergent synthesis of both trans&#8208;selective and cis&#8208;selective useful enol ethers are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, ligand&#8208;controlled hydroalkoxylation of alkynylnitriles with alcohols under mild conditions. Through metal&#8211;ligand cooperation, a range of (Z)&#8208; and (E)&#8208;3&#8208;alkoxyvinylnitriles were obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity by simply tuning the steric properties of PNP&#8208;pincer ligands: bulkier tBuPNP&#8211;Mn catalyst favored Z&#8208;selectivity, while less hindered iPrPNP&#8211;Mn catalyst led to E&#8208;selectivity. This method features a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance and exceptional chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Z&#8208;products are initially formed in both cases, with the iPrPNP&#8211;Mn catalyst further promoting isomerization to the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;isomers.

         <title>Ordered Copper Triangular Atomic Sites for Industrial&#8208;Grade Electromethanation of CO2 via Self&#8208;Regulated Adsorption of Reactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered copper triangular atomic site motifs loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI) were synthesized via a precise ion exchange strategy. Cu TAS/PHI enables enhanced CO2 coverage and activation with balanced proton supply through self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, as well as unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, achieving an FECH4 of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an FECD4 of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown considerable potential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methane but face constraints of low selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities (&gt;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and limited economic viability. Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &gt;60% across 100&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, it enables CO2 deuteration to high&#8208;value methane&#8208;d4 with an FE of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an estimated annual return on investment of 425.35%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO2, as well as balanced proton supply via self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO2RR products. This work demonstrates a strategy to construct ordered multiatomic sites for highly selective CO2RR at industrial&#8208;grade current density and highlights the extraordinary financial potential of electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce high&#8208;value deuterated chemicals.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Neopentyl Sodium: A Hydrocarbon&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Controlled Sodiation of Non&#8208;Activated Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Displaying strong controlled metalating power, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble sodium neopentyl can deprotonate challenging non&#8208;activated arenes and alkenes, with sodiated intermediates successfully undergoing onward functionalisation reactions. By characterising key reaction intermediates, and running computational studies on models, insight has been gained on the structure, bonding, and special reactivity of this promising new reagent.








Abstract
While recent studies have shown that organosodium reagents can offer excellent promise in organic synthesis, their widespread applications can be hindered by their limited solubility in organic solvents, lack of stability, and uncontrolled reactivity. Improving this immature area, here we report the structure of unsolvated neopentyl sodium, which exhibits a unique discrete tetrameric motif and good solubility in hexane. Combining spectroscopic and crystallographic studies with computational bonding analysis, key insights into its constitution and stability have been gained. Expanding its synthetic potential, supporting neopentyl sodium with Lewis donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) allows for the direct metalation of challenging non&#8208;activated arenes and alkenes, including the regioselective meta&#8208;functionalisation of selected 1,3&#8208;disubstituted alkyl arenes. Shedding light on sodium&#8208;mediated metalation protocols, key organometallic intermediates have been isolated and structurally defined, which can subsequently be intercepted with CO2 or a boron electrophile to be directly used in Pd&#8208;catalysed Suzuki cross coupling reactions.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials for Amplification and Dynamic Modulation of Chiral Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently chiral bimetallic cluster aggregates were synthesized using a simple methodology. The introduction of both chiral and achiral additives during synthesis resulted in reversed and amplified chiroptical responses, along with aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission. A remarkably high absorption and emission dissymmetry factor of (&#177;)0.05 was achieved, opening newer avenues in the field.








Abstract
Chiral metal clusters have garnered significant research interest in recent years due to their unique photophysical and chiroptical properties. Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)&#8211;silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster&#8208;assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology&#8208;dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (&#177;)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited&#8208;state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light&#8208;emitting materials.

An&#160;in situ&#160;sulfur modification strategy is reported to convert a commercial NF cathode into a NiSx&#8208;modified electrode through lattice infiltration of electrochemically generated S2&#8315;. The in situ formed electrode enables the electrochemical deuterothiolation of alkynes with disulfides (RSSR) and D2O, affording D&#8208;labeled vinyl sulfides with up to 98% alkene selectivity and 99% deuterated ratios. The RSSR serves a dual purpose by supplying RS&#8315; and S2&#8315; simultaneously.








Abstract
The deuterated thiol&#8211;yne reaction using D2O represents an attractive strategy for simultaneously introducing pharmaceutically relevant C(sp2)&#9472;D bonds and vinyl sulfide motifs. However, achieving high deuterium (D) incorporation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report an electrochemical deuterated thiol&#8211;yne reaction that delivers D&#8208;containing vinyl sulfides with up to 98% alkene selectivity and 99% D incorporation, employing disulfides (RSSR) and D&#8322;O over an&#160;in situ&#160;sulfur&#8208;modified nickel foam (NF) electrode. Mechanistic studies reveal a reductive cleavage of RSSR to RS&#8315; intermediates, which subsequently form surface nickel sulfide (NiSx) species through R&#9472;S bond cleavage. In situ&#160;and&#160;ex situ&#160;characterizations confirm the NiSx formation and its role in reducing alkene adsorption, thereby suppressing its overreduction. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability across terminal and internal alkynes, as well as aromatic and aliphatic disulfides, furnishing 30 diverse examples of D&#8208;labeled vinyl sulfides.

         <title>Fully Exposed Silver Clusters Enabling Highly Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully exposed silver clusters were successfully anchored on poly(heptazinimide), demonstrating exceptional photocatalytic activity toward H2O2 generation in pure water from O2. Systematic evaluation revealed that it also exhibited significantly enhanced performance compared to their single&#8208;atom counterpart due to superior electronic properties and synergetic effect between adjacent Ag atoms.








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of H2O2 in pure water holds great potential for sustainable industry. However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H2O2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent&#8208;reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron&#8208;rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H2O2. Interestingly, its Ag single&#8208;atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H2O2 into &#183;OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H Coupling of Arylacetamides and Sulfoxides: An Interrupted Pummerer/[2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic Rearrangement Sequence</title>

A two&#8208;step formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amido sulfonium salts and provides an alternative to transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation. The protocol is showcased in a short synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator.








Abstract
Arylacetamides are important structural motifs found in many bioactive compound classes. Given their significance, the selective decoration of arylacetamides by transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has attracted considerable attention. Here, we report a two&#8208;step transition metal&#8208;free formal C&#9472;H/C&#9472;H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides that proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little&#8208;known &#945;&#8208;amido sulfonium salts; the amide motif &#8220;catches&#8221; the sulfoxide partner prior to its delivery to the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic ring by rearrangement of a sulfur ylide intermediate. The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations. This protocol has allowed the synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator without recourse to the use of transition metals.

         <title>Chemically Cross&#8208;Linked Polybenzimidazole Membranes with Ion&#8208;Conductive Sub&#8208;Nanometer Channels for Zinc&#8211;Iron Flow Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, we constructed cross&#8208;linked polybenzimidazole (CL&#8208;PBI) membranes with charged sub&#8208;nanochannels via in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction during dual&#8208;coagulation bath&#8208;induced phase separation process. Guided by &#8220;dehydration&#8211;diffusion&#8221; mechanism associated with steric effects and ion&#8211;pore wall interactions, the as&#8208;prepared CL&#8208;PBI membranes enable fast and selective ion transport under confinement through the precise control of channel size and channel chemistry.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer micropores are essential in various separation processes and energy&#8208;related devices. However, the absence of molecular&#8208;level insights into ion transport behavior in sub&#8208;nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross&#8208;linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom&#8208;scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual&#8208;coagulation bath&#8208;induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion&#8211;pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub&#8208;nanometer channels. Based on &#8220;dehydration&#8211;diffusion&#8221; mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion&#8211;pore wall interactions facilitate low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc&#8211;iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub&#8208;nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next&#8208;generation ion&#8208;selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Diboration of 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective diboration of dihydropyridines is described that provides an inroad for the construction of substituted piperidine motifs. Insight into the reaction mechanism was gained by DFT experiments, and the reaction products were applied in the construction of relevant heterocyclic intermediates.








Abstract
Dihydropyridines undergo enantioselective 1,4&#8208;diboration in the presence of a chiral Pt&#8208;based catalyst. The resulting diboryl piperidines can undergo diverse stereospecific cross&#8208;couplings, allowing the construction of an array of different substituted chiral piperidines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into a plausible diboration pathway that involves a platinum&#8208;centered reaction between coordinated B2L2 reagent and the diene to furnish an intermediate &#960;&#8211;allyl platinum complex.

The resulting diboryl piperidines can undergo diverse stereospecific cross-couplings, allowing the construction of an array of different substituted chiral piperidines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into a plausible diboration pathway that involves a platinum-centered reaction between coordinated B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reagent and the diene to furnish an intermediate &#960;&#8211;allyl platinum complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Ion Transport Homogenization in 3D Hierarchical MOF for Ultrastable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical pore channels of MIL&#8208;100 confine LiI to form a conductive ionic network, while its triple&#8208;level cross&#8208;linked multi&#8208;stage porous restricts TFSI&#8315; anion mobility, enabling rapid Li&#8314; transport and uniform deposition by optimizing ion flux and suppressing space charge effects.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion&#8208;transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X&#9552;Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL&#8208;100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF&#8208;HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5&#8211;1&#160;nm) of MIL&#8208;100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size&#8208;selective sieving but also enable continuous Li&#8314; transport through tunable host&#8211;guest interactions between the Lewis&#8208;acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI&#8208;embedded composite (E&#8208;LiI) exhibits a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.88 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li&#8314; plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen&#8208;dependent desolvation energetics and Li+ transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E&#8208;LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention &#8764;100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi&#8208;scale ion&#8208;conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state battery systems.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Metallic Binding Characteristics of the Intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;Block Cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722;</title>

         <dc:description>
A covalent interaction between La and Bi atoms in the intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;block cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8211;, similar to but larger than that in XeF2, is revealed based on quantum chemistry and valence band X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy.








Abstract
Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#9472;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8211;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.

         <title>The Design of Interfacial Organic&#8208;Riched Phase by Molecular Interlocking for Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode surface by introducing sodium anthraquinone&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) into electrolyte. The zincophilic &#8208;SO3&#8722; groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anode. Simultaneously, low&#8208;polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone groups are emerged on the top surface of the AQS layer, attracting more AQS and EG molecules by the molecular interlocking effect to construct the ORP layer. This ORP layer will effectively inhibit the side reactions on Zn anodes.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage devices due to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they suffer from some issues in Zn anodes, including dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction, and byproducts. Herein, an organic&#8208;riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode by introducing sodium anthraquinone&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) into the aqueous electrolyte with ethylene glycol (EG). In such an electrolyte, the zincophilic &#8208;SO3&#8722; groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anodes, and stable chemical bonds are achieved between them. After that, the low&#8208;polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone group in the AQS layer tends to repel H2O molecules. Simultaneously, more AQS and EG molecules are attracted and migrate toward AQS layer due to polar compatibility, constructing the AQS/EG&#8208;riched layer on the Zn anode by the interlocking effect among them. When Zn2+ solvated structures migrate through the ORP layer on Zn anode surface, AQS and EG molecules enter Zn2+ solvated structures, and thus, the solvated H2O molecules are removed. As a result, hydrogen evolution and side reactions were significantly suppressed, and the Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes during plating/stripping process reached 99.56%. To illustrate the feasibility of the ORP layer, Zn||V2O5 full cells were assembled and exhibited superior cycling performance.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction in Artificial Seawater Electrolyte Catalyzed by Strong&#8208;Acid/Base&#8208;Resistant MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOF with strong acid/base resistance can be applied in hectogram&#8208;scale preparation with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g&#8722;1 and enables highly efficient CO2 electroreduction using artificial seawater electrolyte. This work addresses a critical challenge of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction in Na&#8208;based electrolytes during electrochemical CO2RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts for sustainable energy applications.








Abstract
NaCl, a primary component of seawater, is a cost&#8208;effective alternative electrolyte for CO2 electroreduction; however, suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge for efficient CO2RR. Herein, a novel Zn&#8208;MOF {[Zn5(tz)6(HCOO)4]&#183;2H2O}n (1, Htz&#160;=&#160;1,2,3&#8208;triazole) was prepared, exhibiting excellent stability in 0.5&#160;M NaCl electrolyte for 16 weeks. 1 could maintain crystalline structure even after exposure to 9&#160;M HCl and 2&#160;M NaOH solutions. 1 achieved high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 94.4% under &#8722;1.5&#160;V in artificial seawater electrolyte and 91.1% FECO in treated natural seawater under &#8722;0.8&#160;V, maintaining performance over 20&#160;h. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H2O in [Na(H2O)5]+ to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram&#8208;scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405&#160;g&#8722;1, showing promising industrial potential in CO2RR. This work addresses a critical challenge of the strongly competitive HER in Na&#8208;based electrolytes during electrochemical CO2RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and economical catalysts for sustainable energy applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NaCl, a primary component of seawater, is a cost-effective alternative electrolyte for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction; however, suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Herein, a novel Zn-MOF {[Zn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(tz)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#183;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Htz&#160;=&#160;1,2,3-triazole) was prepared, exhibiting excellent stability in 0.5&#160;M NaCl electrolyte for 16 weeks. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; could maintain crystalline structure even after exposure to 9&#160;M HCl and 2&#160;M NaOH solutions. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; achieved high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) of 94.4% under &#8722;1.5&#160;V in artificial seawater electrolyte and 91.1% FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; in treated natural seawater under &#8722;0.8&#160;V, maintaining performance over 20&#160;h. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; could anchor coordinated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in [Na(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; could be applied in hectogram-scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, showing promising industrial potential in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. This work addresses a critical challenge of the strongly competitive HER in Na-based electrolytes during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and economical catalysts for sustainable energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engineered Sub&#8208;10 nm Surface Fluorination Enables Ultraselective Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface fluorination of PDMS&#8208;coated hollow fiber membranes via CF4 plasma engineering achieves sub&#8208;10&#160;nm nanoscale modification, simultaneously enhancing chain rigidity and narrowing pore size distribution. The optimized membrane demonstrates record gas separation performance with industrial&#8208;scale stability, surpassing the 2019 perfluoropolymer upper bounds and conventional polymeric hollow fiber membranes.








Abstract
While polymeric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) offer scalable solutions for gas separations, their performance is fundamentally limited by the permeance&#8208;selectivity tradeoff and imprecise microporosity regulation. Herein, we propose a surface fluorination strategy using carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) plasma to engineer a sub&#8208;10&#160;nm fluorinated and crosslinked layer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)&#8208;coated Matrimid&#174; HFMs. Through precise modulation of plasma parameters, we achieved controlled substitution of PDMS methyl groups/methyl hydrogen atoms with fluorine species (up to 27.7 mol% F content), 5.3&#8208;fold enhanced chain rigidity via fluorine&#8208;induced interchain interactions and steric hindrance, as well as narrowed pore size distribution with preferential ultra&#8208;micropore filling. The optimized HFM&#8208;50W&#8208;65Pa&#8208;500s membrane exhibits record&#8208;breaking He/N2 and He/CH4 selectivities of 1202 &#177; 13 and 1790 &#177; 12 with 170 &#177; 2 GPU He permeance, surpassing perfluoropolymer upper bounds and outperforming previously reported polymeric HFMs. Remarkably, it demonstrates molecular discrimination precision (&#945;(He/CO2) = 56 &#177; 2.2, &#945;(He/H2) = 4.1 &#177; 0.2) for pure&#8208;gas and attractive ternary He/(CO2+CH4) selectivity of 1005 &#177; 20 under 40&#8208;bar mixed&#8208;gas conditions while maintaining 720&#8208;h operational stability. This plasma&#8208;engineered fluorination paradigm combines nanoscale precision with industrial scalability, opening new avenues for advanced membrane design.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Catalysed Hydrofluorination of Alkynes at Room Temperature Promoted by a Fluoride Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an air and moisture tolerant platinum&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination system that gives selectively (Z)&#8208;fluoroalkenes. Experimental and computational investigation on the mechanism allowed for the identification of catalytic species. The hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF, resulting into BF3, PF5 and HF serving as fluoride shuttles.








Abstract
Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic &#223;&#8208;fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF3, HF as well as PF5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer&#8208;sphere fluorination of the metal&#8208;bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.

         <title>Feedstock&#8208;Derived Thiophene Radical Anions Exhibiting Redox Stability at Extreme Potentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although organic redox systems are emerging as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, stability at high cell voltage is often achieved at the expense of synthetic accessibility. Here, we isolate and characterize a feedstock&#8208;derived thiophene radical anion bearing simple ester groups. Despite a minimalist design, the radical and its derivatives are stable at extreme potentials, enabling their use as readily accessible electrolytes for electron storage.








Abstract
Organic radicals that are both readily synthesized from commodity chemicals and stable at extreme redox potentials are rare, yet highly desirable for applications in energy storage and organic electronics. Herein, we report feedstock&#8208;derived thiophene radical anions bearing ester functionalities that undergo galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge redox cycling at potentials below &#8722;2&#160;V versus Fc/Fc+ (Fc&#160;=&#160;ferrocene). Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low&#8208;cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced &#8220;quinoidal&#8221; thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.

         <title>Chloromethoxytrityls: Tuning the SOMO Level of Stable Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we use chlorine and methoxy groups to control the singly occupied molecular orbital level of triarylmethyl radicals within a wide range of 1.8&#160;eV and establish structure&#8208;properties relationships between the substituents and photophysical properties of triarylmethyl radicals.








Abstract
Luminescent radicals are of significant recent interest because of the unique quantum properties of the doublet excited state. Control of the energy level of the singly&#8208;occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open&#8208;shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron&#8208;poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of &#8211;5.7 to &#8211;3.9&#160;eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one&#8208;electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO &#8804; &#8208;4.5&#160;eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled&#8208;cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open&#8208;shell species.

We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled-cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open-shell species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>General Base&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction via Electrophilic Substitution Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is an indispensable tool for carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Here, a base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction was explored and enabled by a conceptually different electrophilic substitution transmetalation mechanism, supported by theoretical and experimental studies. The generality and efficacy of this method were exemplified by broad substrate scope and pharmaceutical synthesis.








Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMC) reaction of organoboron nucleophiles with aryl (pseudo)halide electrophiles is a reliable method for carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation. This reaction generally requires the use of an exogenous base to promote transmetalation process, which limits the substrate scope of the reaction due to undesired protodeboronation and functional group incompatibilities. Here, we established a base&#8208;free SMC reaction via a conceptually different electrophilic substitution transmetalation (EST). This transformation is applicable to a wide range of base&#8208;sensitive and sterically hindered organoborons. Key to this advance is the formation of a stable cationic palladium(II) or nickel(II) intermediate via experimental and theoretical investigations. In a broader context, this research further expands the synthetic boundary of cross&#8208;coupling chemistry.

         <title>Monodisperse Regulation of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Via Dipole Molecules for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong dipole molecules are employed to regulate the monodispersity of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) micelles and coverage distribution of the resulting SAM films, achieving an efficiency of 26.58%.








Abstract
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly drives the enhancement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSC). However, the transition mechanism of SAM molecules from colloidal solutions to films remains unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the SAM precursor solutions and the crystallization quality of the resulting SAM and perovskite films. Fibrous micelles of about 460&#160;nm are found in the pristine SAMs solution, leading to nonuniform and low coverage distribution of films. Strong dipole molecules are employed to establish supramolecular interactions with SAMs, enabling the formation of highly monodisperse cubic micelles in solution (160&#160;nm) and uniform SAM films. The contact at buried interface is determined by the balance between dipole moment and steric hindrance. Consequently, the regulated SAMs based inverted PSCs (0.09&#160;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (aperture area of 14.40&#160;cm2) achieves efficiency of 26.58% (certificated 25.81%) and 22.95%, respectively. The optimized devices retain more than 96.30% of the initial efficiency for 5,100&#160;h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 condition with a linear fitting extrapolation to T90 of 11,259&#160;h and 98.30% efficiency for 2,660&#160;h under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 condition. This work highlights the great potential of SAMs micelle regulation for achieving efficient and stable PSC.

         <title>Recyclable Side&#8208;Chain Azobenzene&#8208;Based Semicrystalline Polymer Films with Outstanding Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity and Photoresponsive Actuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen&#8208;bond network along the polymer chain through reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, side&#8208;chain azobenzene&#8208;containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and easy recyclability/reprocessability were developed.








Abstract
Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity (&#955;) of 0.1&#8764;0.5&#160;W/(m&#183;K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices. This study proposes a molecular level design strategy for side&#8208;chain azobenzene&#8208;containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and recyclability. By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen&#8208;bond network along the polymer chain through controlled radical polymerization, a thermal conduction network featuring &#8220;high&#8208;efficiency conduction within crystal domains and low&#8208;resistance interfacial connections&#8221; was constructed. Azobenzene moieties self&#8208;assemble into highly oriented crystalline domains through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, where their dense packing significantly enhances phonon coupling efficiency and increases phonon mean free paths. Concurrently, the dynamic reversibility of hydrogen bonds guides domain&#8208;boundary molecular chains to form gradual phase transitions, suppressing phonon scattering at amorphous&#8208;crystalline interfaces and improving phonon transport efficiency. The film of random copolymer with 35 azobenzene units achieves an outstanding highest intrinsic &#955; of 2.01&#160;W/(m&#183;K), representing a substantial improvement over its block copolymer counterpart (with a higher crystallinity) and traditional polymers. Additionally, the photoisomerization property of azobenzene endows the material with light&#8208;controlled dynamic deformation capabilities. Meanwhile, the noncrosslinked polymer films feature easy recyclability/reprocessability.

         <title>Functionalized Calix[4]Nanocones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we present a synthesis of a nanocone based on a calix[4]arene, which has additional functional groups at the peripheral rims. Due to its rigid structure in combination with alkoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution. It exhibits high selectivity for binding Na+ over Li+ and also K+ in CDCl3.








Abstract
The interest in synthesizing conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) and nanocones has increased recently. Although a number of various structures have been achieved, almost none have additional functional groups at the peripheral rims. Based on a calix[4]arene, a functionalized calix[4]nanocone was synthesized. Due to its rigid structure in combination with methoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution by NMR measurements. The nanocone shows a high selectivity for binding Na+ in favor of Li+ and K+ in CDCl3. By comparing the nanocone with a related but structurally flexible methoxy calix[4]arene, the impact of structural rigidity on selectivity is clearly demonstrated.

Efficient C2F6 purification from ternary CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/C2F6 mixture is realized by a stable and easily scalably&#8208;synthesized hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with matching electrostatic potentials and appropriate pore sizes.








Abstract
Developing stable, efficient and easily scalably&#8208;synthesized adsorbents for removal of hydrofluoroethanes to obtain high purity hexafluoroethane (C2F6) is of great importance to the electronics industry. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;TDBB) which exhibits statically as well as dynamically preferential hydrofluoroethanes (CF3CH2F and CF3CHF2) adsorption and achieves efficient one&#8208;step C2F6 purification from CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/C2F6 mixture. At 298&#160;K, 11.7&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 of high&#8208;purity C2F6 can be obtained by HOF&#8208;TDBB from 5/5/90 CF3CH2F/CF3CHF2/C2F6 mixture. Additionally, excellent stability endows HOF&#8208;TDBB with good separation ability under various harsh conditions. For example, the separation performance can be well maintained within the dozens of consecutive separation experiments. Even at 338&#160;K, 5.7&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 of pure C2F6 can also be collected. More importantly, this material can be rapidly synthesized with a large scale by simple rotary evaporation. Combined with excellent separation performance, high stability and scalable synthesis, HOF&#8208;TDBB has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Catalytic Dearomative Coupling of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced dearomative dimerization of N&#8208;heteroarenes has been developed to construct pyridine&#8208;fused bridged polycyclic scaffolds via an intertwined EnT/SET pathway. By the regulation of additives, the catalytic dearomative cross&#8208;coupling of two different quinolines has also been realized.








Abstract
Naturally occurring dimeric products have attracted considerable attention from both chemists and pharmacologists. The construction of pseudo&#8208;dimers often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Dearomatization reactions represent an ideal method to transform planar aromatics into 3D skeletons, which has attracted increasing interest in medicinal chemistry and total synthesis. Herein, we present a dearomative dimerization of N&#8208;heteroarenes under mild photochemical conditions. Through additive regulation, the catalytic dearomative cross&#8208;coupling of two distinct quinolines could also be achieved. With aromatic compounds as coupling partners, this strategy provides a straightforward avenue to pseudo&#8208;dimers of N&#8208;heteroarenes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal the intertwined EnT/SET nature and offered guidelines for synthesizing novel bridged polycycles. In addition, this strategy provides an effective approach for constructing functional polymers with high atom economy and environmental benefits via metal&#8208;free, one&#8208;pot polymerization. Furthermore, the synthetic transformations offer a complementary route to access formal crossed products that were previously inaccessible.

         <title>Flexibility&#8208;Aided Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting and Transformations of Bioactive Homochiral Cuboctahedron Pd12L16</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking concave morphologies found in nature, we have introduced flexible, unsymmetric, tridentate ligand (L) which undergoes coordination self&#8208;assembly into highly organized chiral Pd6L8 or Pd12L16 cages that can undergo interspecific transformations. The cages, being based on natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate high cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations.








Abstract
The rational design and selective self&#8208;assembly of flexible and unsymmetric ligands into large coordination complexes is an eminent challenge in supramolecular coordination chemistry. Here, we present the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of natural ursodeoxycholic&#8208;bile&#8208;acid&#8208;derived unsymmetric tris&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L) resulting in the selective and switchable formation of chiral stellated Pd6L8 and Pd12L16 cages. The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self&#8208;sorting of L into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right&#8208;handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.

         <title>Pyridine Nitrogen Decorated Carbon Support for High&#8208;Performance Seawater Electrolyte&#8208;Based Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support loaded Fe single&#8208;atom sites to improve the oxygen reduction reaction performance in seawater electrolyte. The study reveals that the pyridinic nitrogen in situ constructs a localized negatively charged interface during the reaction process, which effectively blocks the attack of Cl&#8315; from seawater on both the carbon support and active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic stability.








Abstract
Developing high specific energy seawater electrolyte&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air batteries (SZABs) is crucial for marine energy supply systems. However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl&#8722; in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst [Fe&#8208;SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe&#8208;SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential (Eonset) and halfwave potential (E1/2) of 1.174 and 0.907&#160;V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (Eonset: 0.972&#160;V, E1/2: 0.848&#160;V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 800&#160;mAh g&#8722;1, surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl&#8722; adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.

         <title>Selective Scission of Orthogonal Bonds in Four&#8208;Membered Ring Mechanophores upon Activation by a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane actuator controls bond scission&#8212;perpendicular or parallel to the axle&#8212;based on bulky group orientation in a 4&#8208;membered ring. This allows diverse functional molecules to be released from a single core structure, expanding the molecular variety obtainable from new or existing mechanophores.








Abstract
Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4&#8208;membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.

The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4-membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro-[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and &#946;-lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle.

         <title>Dual Co Sites in n&#9472;n Type Heterojunction Enable Selective Electrochemical Co&#8208;Valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>

Dual Co sites and built&#8208;in electric field in CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C were used for selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#9472;N&#9472;C n&#9472;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12&#160;V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#9472;to&#9472;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#160;h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#9472;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#9472;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi&#8208;functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Controlled Crystallization Kinetics via Conjugated Organic Spacers Enables Ordered Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;Step Deposited Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 37, September 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth strategy is innovatively developed to regulate tin&#8208;based perovskite crystallization kinetics by constructing two&#8208;dimensional growth template for reducing lattice orientational mismatch through energetically unfavorable pathway, yielding desirable facet orientation. Ultimately, the resulting device delivers the highest power conversion efficiency of 14.03% with outstanding reproducibility by two&#8208;step sequential deposition.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced &#960;&#8208;conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)&#8208;dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI2 to pre&#8208;form NEA2SnI4, which subsequently converts to NEA2FASn2I7 and ultimately FASnI3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long&#8208;term stability. Consequently, the NEAI&#8208;based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04&#160;cm2) and 12.44% (1&#160;cm2), representing the record performance for two&#8208;step deposited tin&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin&#8208;based perovskite films, paving the way for high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.</dc:description>
