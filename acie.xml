      <title>A Palette of Minimally&#8208;Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>Sucrose is the main saccharide transported in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (~50 Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound  6  as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein we demonstrate the application of compound  6  as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Li&#8208;Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal&#8208;based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode&#8208;free Li metal battery by introducing Li&#8208;rich Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  into the cathode as a Li&#8208;ions extender. The Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li&#8208;rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode&#8208;free pouch cells enable to achieve 447&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg  &#8722;1  &#160;energy density and 84% capacity retention after 100 cycles&#160;in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2 g&#8201;Ah  &#8722;1  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H  2  S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S&#8208;nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H  2  S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645 nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936 nm (H  2  S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water&#8208;soluble BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H  2  S. These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H  2  S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical conversion and locking of the imine linkage: enhancing the functionality of covalent organic frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in (opto)electronics, sensing and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation.

      <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} By Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>The 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW  8  O  30  } was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity(IC  50  =0.29&#956;M). Based on proteomics analysis, Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN&#8208;binding redox enzymes(relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  , which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN&#8208;binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  combined with FMN to form Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  &#8208;2FMN complex through the one&#8208;electron processe of the W atoms. Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3% at 1.77 &#181;M of NADPH and 86.06% at 10.62 &#181;M of 2&#8208;hydroxy terephthalic acid.

      <title>A Molecular Reporter for Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Based on An Aggregation Induced Emission Platform</title>
      <dc:description>With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs) a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like to a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network are denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. Being able to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, as opposed to vitrify, is a challenge, since both processes lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Here, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method with a high fluorescence contrast to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP&#8208;surfactants (NPSs) at the water/oil interface using aggregation induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. At densities where the AIEgens can move and rotate the AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the intermolecular separation distance is sufficiently small to arrest rotation and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs. This fluorescence behavior provides a unique means to probe jamming behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>Steering electron&#8208;hole migration pathways using oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides to enhance their photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance</title>
      <dc:description>Overall water splitting efficiency is mainly restricted by the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts.

We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV&#8208;Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra.

      <title>TM LDH Meets Birnessite: A 2D&#8208;2D Hybrid Catalyst with Long&#8208;term Stability for Water Oxidation at Industrial Operating Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Efficient noble&#8208;metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water splitting. Inspired by Nature&#8217;s oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D&#8208;2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8208;) hybrid. The as&#8208;constructed LDH(+)&#8208;Binessite(&#8208;) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85 &#186;C and 6 M KOH) for more than 20 h at the current densities larger than 100 mA/cm  2  . Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO  2  , and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(&#8208;), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO  2  to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricating highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site&#8208;Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Electron&#8208;transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  ) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron&#8208;transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Molecular Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt; 70 mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O  2  &#160;increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. We demonstrated that H  2  O  2  &#160;generated from O  2  &#160;reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides allows for the expansion of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics.

Thin films of this material show a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor as high as ~0.06.

      <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Amorphous Zn&#8208;Carbon Multichannel Fibers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium metal has drawn wide attention as a competitive anode candidate for next&#8208;generation high energy density rechargeable batteries. However, the application of lithium metal anodes for practical batteries is still impeded by safety issues and low Coulombic efficiency caused mainly by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. Herein, two types of free&#8208;standing nitrogen&#8208;doped amorphous Zn&#8208;carbon multichannel fibers are synthesized as multifunctional hosts for lithium accommodation. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroporous structures endow effectively reduced local current density, and the lithiophilic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon and functional Zn nanoparticles served as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to guide uniform lithium deposition. As a result, the developed anodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles at various current densities from 1 to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and symmetric cells show long&#8208;term cycling duration over 2000 h. Moreover, full cells based on the developed anode and a LiFePO4 cathode also demonstrate superior rate capability and stable cycle life.</dc:description>

      <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging, despite the importance in understanding of their functions in diverse cellular processes. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria and nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxygen stress in live cells. Moreover, the combination of organelle&#8208;specific targeting with the remotely&#8208;controlled photoactivation of the nanosensors allows the precise APE1 imaging in vivo. We envision that this site&#8208;specific sensor technology will become a valuable tool for in situ monitoring subcellular enzymatic activity that is difficult to access using traditional imaging probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host&#8208;Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The tuning of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the&#160;properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr&#8208;1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host&#8208;guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  and 6  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  , 30  o  , respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns.

      <title>Iron oxidation in Escherichia coli bacterioferritin ferroxidase centre, a site designed to react rapidly with H2O2 but slowly with O2</title>
      <dc:description>Both O  2  and H  2  O  2  can oxidise iron at the ferroxidase centre (FC) of  Escherichia coli  bacterioferritin (EcBfr) but mechanistic details of the two reactions need clarification. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies have been used to follow the reactions when apo&#8208;EcBfr, pre&#8208;loaded anaerobically with Fe  2+  , was exposed to O  2  or H  2  O  2  . We show that O  2  binds di&#8208;Fe  2+  FC reversibly, two Fe  2+  ions are oxidised in concert and a H  2  O  2  molecule is formed and released to solution. This peroxide molecule further oxidises another di&#8208;Fe  2+  FC, at a rate ~1000 faster than O  2  , ensuring an overall 1:4 stoichiometry of iron oxidation by O  2  . Initially formed Fe  3+  can further react with H  2  O  2  (producing protein bound radicals) but relaxes within seconds to an H  2  O  2  &#8208;unreactive di&#8208;Fe  3+  form. The data obtained suggest that the primary role of EcBfr  in vivo  may be to detoxify H  2  O  2  rather than sequester iron.</dc:description>

      <title>Responsive Emulsions for Sequential Multienzyme Cascades</title>
      <dc:description>Multienzyme cascade biocatalysis is an efficient synthetic process, avoiding the isolation/purification of intermediates and shifting the equilibria of unfavourable steps. However, multienzyme systems are often limited by their incompatibility and cross&#8208;reactivity. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;responsive emulsion to proceed multienzyme reactions sequentially for high reactivity. The emulsion is achieved using a CO  2&#160;  , pH, and thermo&#8208;responsive block copolymer as a stabilizer, allowing the on&#8208;demand control of emulsion morphology and phase composition. Applying this system to a three&#8208;step cascade reaction enables the individual optimal condition for each enzyme, and a high overall conversion (ca. 97% of the calculated limit) is thereby obtained. Moreover, the multi&#8208;responsiveness of the emulsion allows the facile and separate yielding/recycling of products, polymers and active enzymes. Besides, the system could be scaled up with a good yield. Therefore, we present a recyclable, scalable, high reactive multienzyme biocatalysis using responsive emulsions, suggesting their fascinating perspectives for synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>C(  sp  3  )&#8722;Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds are insufficiently site&#8208;selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H&#8208;atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily&#8208;accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction&#8217;s exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late&#8208;stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

      <title>Vacancy&#8208;Enabled O3 Phase Stabilization for Manganese&#8208;rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn&#8208;rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2&#8208;3.8V with &gt;86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre&#8208;formed in the sodiated material enables a &#8220;reversible&#8221; migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de&#8208;sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3&#8208;P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Interplay Between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a novel rotaxane/foldaxane hybrid architecture is reported. The winding of an aromatic oligoamide helix host around a dumbbell&#8208;shaped thread&#8208;like guest, or axle, already surrounded by a macrocycle was evidenced by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The process proved to depend on the position of the macrocycle along the axle and to the associated steric hindrance. The macrocycle thus behaves as a switchable shield that modulates the affinity of the helix for the axle. Reciprocally, the foldamer helix acts as a supramolecular auxiliary that compartmentalizes the axle. In some cases, the macrocycle is forced to move along the axle to allow the foldamer to reach its best recognition site.</dc:description>

      <title>Strain&#8208;Modulated Reactivity: an Acidic Silane</title>
      <dc:description>Compounds of main&#8208;group elements such as silicon are attractive candidates for green and inexpensive catalysts.

      <title>Chiral Self&#8208;sorting of Giant Cubic [8+12] Salicylimine Cage Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral self&#8208;sorting is intricately connected to the complicated chiral processes observed in nature and no artificial systems of comparably complexity have been generated by chemists. However, only a few examples of purely organic molecules have been reported so far, where the self&#8208;sorting process could be controlled. Among those systems a handful of shape&#8208;persistent organic cages were studied and rarely narcisstic or social self&#8208;sorting could be controlled. Herein, we describe the chiral self&#8208;sorting of large cubic [8+12] salicylimine cage compounds based on a chiral TBTQ precursor. Out of 23 possible cage isomers only the enantiopure and a  meso  cage were observed to be formed, which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, by careful choice of solvent the formation of meso&#8208;cage could be controlled. With internal diameters of  d  in  = 3.3&#8208;3.5 nm these cages are among the largest organic cage compounds characterized and show very high specific surface areas up to approx. 1500 m  2  /g after desolvation.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>Hydration of alkenes using first row transition metals (Fe, Co, Mn) under oxygen atmosphere (Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration) is highly practical for alkene functionalization in complex synthesis. Different hydration protocols have been developed, however, control of the stereoselectivity remains a challenge. Herein, highly diastereoselective Fe&#8208;catalyzed anaerobic Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydration of alkenes using nitroarenes as oxygenation reagents is reported. The nitro moiety is not well explored in radical chemistry and nitroarenes are known to suppress free radical processes. Our findings show the potential of cheap nitroarenes as oxygen donors in radical transformations. Secondary and tertiary alcohols were prepared with excellent Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity. The method features large functional group tolerance and is also applicable to highly diastereoselective alkene hydration of natural products, qualifying the protocol for late&#8208;stage chemical functionalization. It is shown that the anaerobic protocol outperforms existing hydration methodology in terms of reaction efficiency and selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient and Selective Interplay Revealed: CO2 Reduction to CO over ZrO2 by Light with Further Reduction to Methane over Ni0 by Heat Converted from Light</title>
      <dc:description>The reaction mechanism of CO  2  photoreduction into methane was elucidated by the time&#8208;course monitoring of the mass chromatogram, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Under  13  CO  2  , H  2  , and UV&#8211;visible light,  13  CH  4  was formed at a rate of 0.98 mmol h  &#8722;1  g  cat  &#8722;1  using Ni (10 wt%)&#8211;ZrO  2  that was effective at 96 kPa. Under UV&#8211;visible light irradiation, the  13  CO  2  exchange reaction and FTIR identified physisorbed/chemisorbed bicarbonate and the reduction because of charge separation in/on ZrO  2  , followed by the transfer of formate and CO onto the Ni surface. EXAFS confirmed exclusive presence of Ni  0  sites. Then, FTIR spectroscopy detected methyl species on Ni  0  , which was reversibly heated to 394 K owing to the heat converted from light. Using D  2  O and H  2  , H/D ratio in the formed methane was in agreement with H/D ratio in reactant.

      <title>Tailoring electronic structure and size of ultrastable M&#8208;MOFs (M = Co, Ni) with enhanced electroconductivity for high&#8208;performance supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) utilized as electrodes for energy storage/conversion has been a challenge due to their incompetent chemical stability and poor electrical conductivity in electrolyte. Here, a nanoscale MOF,  Co  0.24  Ni  0.76  &#8208;bpa&#8208;200  , possessing ultrahigh stability with uncommon semiconductor behavior (&#963; = 4.2 &#215; 10  &#8208;3  S m  &#8208;1  ) was fabricated by a combination of robust hydrophobic paddlewheel, optimized Co/Ni ratio, MOF size and conjugated degree of coligand. DFT study reveals that the appropriate Ni  2+  doping reduces the activation energy of system and thus yields a higher carrier concentration, and the strongly delocalized N&#8208;donor ligand notably increases the metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to achieve efficient charge migration, leading to continuous through&#8208;bond (&#8208;CoNi&#8208;N&#8208;CoNi&#8208;)  &#8734;  conduction paths. The structural features endow the MOF with a good cycling stability of 86.5% (10000 cycles) and a high specific capacitance of 1927.14 F g  &#8208;1  among pristine MOF&#8208;based electrodes.</dc:description>

DFT study reveals that the appropriate Ni  2+  doping reduces the activation energy of system and thus yields a higher carrier concentration, and the strongly delocalized N&#8208;donor ligand notably increases the metal&#8208;ligand orbital overlap to achieve efficient charge migration, leading to continuous through&#8208;bond (&#8208;CoNi&#8208;N&#8208;CoNi&#8208;)  &#8734;  conduction paths. The structural features endow the MOF with a good cycling stability of 86.5% (10000 cycles) and a high specific capacitance of 1927.14 F g  &#8208;1  among pristine MOF&#8208;based electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Intramolecular Electric Field Construction in Metal Phthalocyanine as Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Material for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;21% Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTs realizes a record value of 21.23% (certified 21.03%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.</dc:description>

Under light irradiation, the electron is injected and stored at the GaN4  &#160;site, where the LUMO locates.

      <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction Over Ultrathin Metallic Ni&#8208;doped CoS2 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Converting CO  2  and H  2  O into carbon&#8208;based fuel by IR light is a tough task. Herein, compared with other single&#8208;component photocatalysts, the most efficient IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction is achieved by an element&#8208;doped ultrathin metallic photocatalyst&#65293;Ni&#8208;doped CoS  2  nanosheets (Ni&#8208;CoS  2  ). The evolution rate of CH  4  over Ni&#8208;CoS  2  is up to 101.8 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  . The metallic and ultrathin nature endow Ni&#8208;CoS  2  with excellent IR light absorption ability. The PL spectra and Arrhenius plots indicate that Ni atoms could facilitate the separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers and the decrease of the activation energy. Moreover, in situ FTIR, DFT calculations, and CH  4  &#8208;TPD reveal that the doped Ni atoms in CoS  2  could effectively depress the formation energy of the *COOH, *CHO and desorption energy of CH  4  . This work manifests that element doping in atomic level is a powerful way to control the reaction intermediates, providing possibilities to realize high&#8208;efficiency IR&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>The formation/decomposition equilibrium of LiH and its contribution on anode failure in practical lithium metal batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Discovering the underlying reason for Li anode failure is a critical step towards applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, we conduct deuterium&#8208;oxide (D2O) titration experiments in a novel on&#8208;line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO2/Li LMBs. The practical cell is comprised of ultrathin Li anode (50 &#956;m), high loading LiCoO2 (17 mg cm&#8208;2, 2.805 mAh cm&#8208;2) and different formulated electrolytes. Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2H2 &#8652; LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode. We believe that the unusual understanding provided by this study will draw forth more insightful efforts to realize efficient Li protection and the ultimate applications of &#8220;holy grail&#8221; LMBs.</dc:description>

To enable access to a larger swath of sequence space, we demonstrate the utility of a cell&#8208;free, ultrahigh&#8208;throughput directed evolution platform for dehydrogenases.

The beads&#8217; phenotype could be read out and sorted for on a flow cytometer by using a highly sensitive fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor of the NAD  +  :NADH ratio.

      <title>Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
      <dc:description>We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor&#8208;binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA&#8208;approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitamin D); retinoids (some known to be active  in vitro  , and vitamin A); and vitamin K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.</dc:description>

      <title>Cryptic sulfur incorporation in thioangucycline biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur&#8208;containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B.

Instead, a series of&#160;  in vitro  &#160;and&#160;  in vivo  &#160;experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non&#8208;enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide.

      <title>Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective</title>
      <dc:description>
This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO2 utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO2 reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO2 molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The insights will be corroborated with the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive potential strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of possible products.
