         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't Hoff&#8208;Le Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives  3  and  4  with van't Hoff&#8208;Le Bel geometry. Species  3  and  4  are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B  2  C rings feature 2c&#8208;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in  3  are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane  5  and dichlorofluorenylborane  6  , respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane  8  and selenaborirane  9  . In addition, transfer hydrogenation of  3  with ammonia borane (H  3  N&#8226;BH  3  ) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane  7  via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Transamidation of Thioamides by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free N&#8211;C(S) Transacylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamides represent highly valuable isosteric in the strictest sense &#8220;single atom substitution&#8221; analogues of amides that have found broad applications in chemistry and biology. A long&#8208;standing challenge is the direct transamidation of thioamides, a process which would convert one thioamide bond (R&#8211;C(S)&#8211;NR  1  R  2  ) into another (R&#8211;C(S)&#8211;NR  3  N  4  ). Herein, we report the first general method for the direct transamidation of thioamides by highly chemoselective N&#8211;C(S) transacylation. The method relies on site&#8208;selective N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl activation of 2&#176; and 1&#176; thioamides, resulting in ground&#8208;state&#8208;destabilization of thioamides, thus enabling to rationally manipulate nucleophilic addition to the thioamide bond. This method showcases a remarkably broad scope including late&#8208;stage functionalization (&gt;100 examples). We further present extensive DFT studies that provide insight into the chemoselectivity and provide guidelines for the development of transamidation methods of the thioamide bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzodiazapyracylenes: Doubly N&#8208;Doped Cyclopenta&#8208;fused Polycyclic Molecules That Exhibit High Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyracylene is a unique cyclopenta&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) that exhibits dual aromatic characteristics. Herein we report the synthesis of doubly N&#8208;doped benzannulated pyracylenes, namely dibenzodiazapyracylenes, by oxidative N&#8211;N linking reaction of [2.2](2,5)pyrrolophane&#8208;type precursors. Dibenzodiazapyracylenes displayed well&#8208;ordered &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular packing&#160;in the solid state, which were feasible for effective hole&#8208;transporting along the stacking direction. High carrier mobility was estimated by microwave conductivity measurements as compared to dibenzoullazine. The high HOMO level of dibenzodiazapyracylene was verified by electrochemistry and its persistent radical cation species has been detected.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reduction&#8208;induced hydrogenation of a helical bilayer nanographene (C138H120) with K or Rb in 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is reported by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Nazario Mart&#237;n et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115747). DFT calculations predict that localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the central [6]helicene backbone (pink hydrogens). The third electron forms a radical trianion on the HBC leading to a final Rb&#8208;complex.

         <title>Mechanism of the Bifunctional Multiple Product Sesterterpene Synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase from Aspergillus calidoustus was characterised that produces calidoustene, a compound with a new skeleton, besides five known compounds. A deep mechanistic investigation through isotopic labelling experiments, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and DFT calculations is presented. The substrate analog 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;FPP was converted into several oxygenated terpenoids.







Abstract
The multiproduct chimeric sesterterpene synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus yielded spirocyclic calidoustene, which exhibits a novel skeleton, besides five known sesterterpenes. The complex cyclisation mechanism to all six compounds was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments in combination with DFT calculations. Chemically synthesised 8&#8208;hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate was converted with isopentenyl diphosphate and AcAS into four oxygenated sesterterpenoids that structurally resemble cytochrome&#8197;P450 oxidation products of the sesterterpene hydrocarbons. Protein engineering of AcAS broadened the substrate scope and gave significantly improved enzyme yields.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Tamsulosin Utilizing Sequential Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a multistep continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, three C&#8722;N bond formation/cleavage reactions with hydrogen gas over heterogeneous catalysts enabled the efficient construction of the key skeleton. Two different polysilane&#8208;modified Pd catalysts were developed for these transformations, which were followed by a deprotection step under homogeneous catalysis to provide tamsulosin in 60&#8201;% overall yield in a flow stream.







Abstract
We describe the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane&#8208;modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (R)&#8208;tamsulosin was obtained in 60&#8201;% yield and 64&#8201;% ee (99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Energy&#8208;Storage Nanoagent for Continuously Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative Stress Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;ferrocene modified persistent luminescence nanoparticle (siRNA&#8208;ApFe&#8208;PLNP) was designed as an energy&#8208;storage nanoagent to achieve continuous amplification of oxidative stress after photo&#8208;activation, eliminating the need for constant light irradiation and further avoiding the photo&#8208;induced tissue damage.







Abstract
Regulation of cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in revealing the molecular mechanisms of cellular activities and thus is a potential strategy for tumor treatment. Optical methods have been employed for intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long&#8208;time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene&#8208;containing nucleic acid&#8208;based energy&#8208;storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo&#8208;regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton&#8208;like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.

         <title>Rational Design of Zinc/Zeolite Catalyst: Selective Formation of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol to Aromatics Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals not only exhibit a significantly long lifetime but also an enhanced shape selectivity for p&#8208;xylene in the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction. The Zn species were directly imaged in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species was determined.







Abstract
The production of p&#8208;xylene from the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction is challenging. The catalytic stability, which is inversely proportional to the particle size of the zeolite, is not always compatible with p&#8208;xylene selectivity, which is inversely proportional to the external acid sites. In this study, based on a nano&#8208;sized zeolite, we designed hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals using the ultra&#8208;dilute liquid&#8208;phase growth technique. The obtained composites possessed one ZSM&#8208;5 layer (&#8776;30&#8197;nm) in the middle and two silicalite&#8208;1 layers (&#8776;20&#8197;nm) epitaxially grown on two sides of ZSM&#8208;5, which exhibited a considerably long lifetime (100&#8201;% methanol conversion &gt;40&#8197;h) as well as an enhanced shape selectivity of p&#8208;xylene (&gt;35&#8201;%) with a p&#8208;xylene/xylene ratio of &#8776;90&#8201;%. Importantly, using this sandwich&#8208;like zeolite structure, we directly imaged the Zn species in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and further determined the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species.

Three cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes featuring two tetrazine units were synthesized and characterized. Upon photoexcitation, the complexes were non&#8208;emissive but displayed up to 3900&#8208;fold emission enhancement upon the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8722;Alder (IEDDA) [4 + 2] cycloaddition with (1  R  ,8  S  ,9  s  )&#8208;bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) substrates. The rapid reaction kinetics (  k  2  up to 1.47 &#215; 10  4  M  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  ) of the complexes toward BCN substrates allowed effective peptide labeling. The complexes were also applied as live cell bioimaging reagents and photocytotoxic agents. One of the complexes was utilized in the preparation of luminescent nanosized hydrogels that exhibited interesting cargo delivery properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamline sulfur redox reactions to achieve efficient room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is vital to dynamically regulate S activity to achieve efficient and stable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT/Na&#8208;S) batteries. Herein, we report using cobalt sulfide as an electron reservoir to enhance the activity of sulfur cathodes, and simultaneously combining with cobalt single atoms as double&#8208;end binding sites for stable S conversion process. The rationally constructed CoS  2  electron reservoir enables the straight reduction of S to short&#8208;chain sodium polysulfides (Na  2  S  4  ) via a streamlined redox path through electron transfer. Meanwhile, cobalt single atoms synergistically working with the electron reservoir to reinforce the streamlined redox path, which immobilize in&#8208;situ formed long&#8208;chain products and catalyze their conversion, thus realizing high S utilization and sustainable cycling stability. The as&#8208;developed sulfur cathodes exhibit a superior rate performance of 443 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  with a high cycling capacity retention of 80 % after 5000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Alkynyl Sulfonium Salts Can Be Employed as Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysts and Generate Alkynyl Radicals under Blue&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding (ChB) has emerged as a promising tool in organic synthesis. However, compared with the well&#8208;developed selenium&#8208; and tellurium&#8208;based salt catalysts, the ChB catalysis of sulfonium salts is still unknown. Here, we report a new type of alkynyl&#8208;sulfonium salt ChB catalysis for various ionic transformations, including transfer hydrogenation, bromination, bromolactonization, dimerization of 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction and Ritter reaction. More importantly, the photocapability of ChB was first demonstrated to generate alkynyl radicals for the synthesis of a variety of chalcogenoacetylenes. Mechanistic studies shed light on the mechanism of the photoinduced reactions and confirmed the involvement of alkynyl radicals which are difficult to be generated otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the High&#8208;Pressure Phase Behaviour of Highly Compressible Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks: From Discontinuous to Continuous Pore Closure by Linker Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;pressure behaviour of flexible zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) of the ZIF&#8208;62 family with the chemical composition&#160;M(im)2&#8208;x(bim)x&#160;is presented (M2+&#160;= Zn2+, Co2+; im&#8211;&#160;= imidazolate; bim&#8211;&#160;= benzimidazolate, 0.02 &#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804; 0.37). High&#8208;pressure powder X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that the materials contract reversibly from an open pore (op) to a closed pore (cp)&#160;phase under a hydrostatic pressure of up to 4000 bar. Sequentially increasing the bim&#8211;&#160;fraction (x) reinforces the framework, leading to an increased threshold pressure for the&#160;op&#8208;to&#8208;cp&#160;phase transition, while the total volume contraction across the transition decreases. Most importantly, the typical discontinuous&#160;op&#8208;to&#8208;cp&#160;transition (first order) changes to an unusual continuous transition (second order) for&#160;x&#160;&#8805; 0.35. This allows finetuning the void volume and the pore size of the material continuously by adjusting the pressure, thus opening new possibilities for MOFs in pressure&#8208;switchable devices, membranes, and actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the tip effect on single&#8208;atom and cluster catalysts: forming reversible oxygen species with high efficiency in chlorine evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlorine evolution reaction has been applied in the production since a century ago. After times of evolution, it has been widely realized by the electrocatalytic process on anode nowadays. However, the anode applied in production contains a large amount of precious metal, increasing the cost. It is thus an opportunity to apply sub&#8208;nano catalysts in this field. By regulating the tip effect (TE) of the catalyst, it was discovered that the oxidized sub&#8208;nano iridium clusters supported by titanium carbide exhibit much higher efficiency than the single&#8208;atom one, which demonstrates the significance of modifying the electronic interaction. Moreover, it exhibits a ~20% decrease of the electricity, ~98% selectivity towards chlorine evolution reaction, and high durability of over 350 h. Therefore, this cluster catalyst performs great potential in applying in the practical production and the comprehension of the tip effect on different types of catalysts is also pushed to a higher level.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Propargylic Alcohols and Propargylic Amines with CO2 Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 with a yolk&#8211;shell structure was synthesized, and it represents the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can effectively catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 are important in industrial applications, but it was a great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu2O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with turnover numbers (TONs) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13C isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu2O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates. Importantly, it is the first example of a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 simultaneously.

         <title>Thermal Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Supramolecular Dopant Towards Efficient and Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic supramolecular adhesives with low glass transition temperature and massive hydrogen bonds were designed by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate. The adhesive dopant facilitates a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect at only 70&#8201;&#176;C and contributes to efficient and highly flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantageous traits such as low cost, portability, light&#8208;weight, etc. However, mechanical stability is still the weak point in their practical application. Herein, we prepared efficient FPSCs with remarkable mechanical stability by a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect, which can be realized by the usage of a supramolecular adhesive. The supramolecular adhesive, which was obtained by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, is amphiphilic, has a proper glass transition temperature and a high density of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and receptors, providing the possibility of thermal dynamic repair of mechanical damage in FPSCs. The adhesive also greatly improves the leveling property of the precursor solution on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)]amine (PTAA) surface. PSCs containing this adhesive achieve more than a 20&#8201;% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and a 21.99&#8201;% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27&#8201;%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.

         <title>Overlooked Factors Required for Electrolyte Solvents in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries: Capabilities of Quenching 1O2 and Forming Highly&#8208;Decomposable Li2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited superior cycle characteristics based on the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2, which have been overlooked as factors required for electrolyte solvents for LOBs.







Abstract
Although sufficient tolerance against attack by superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;) has been mainly recognized as an important property for Li&#8211;O2 battery (LOB) electrolytes, recent evidence has revealed that other critical factors also govern the cyclability, prompting a reconsideration of the basic design guidelines of LOB electrolytes. Here, we found that LOBs equipped with a N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA)&#8208;based electrolyte exhibited better cyclability compared with other standard LOB electrolytes. This superior cyclability is attributable to the capabilities of quenching 1O2 and forming highly decomposable Li2O2. The 1O2 quenching capability is equivalent to that of a tetraglyme&#8208;based electrolyte containing a several millimolar concentration of a typical chemical quencher. Based on these overlooked factors, the DMA&#8208;based electrolyte led to superior cyclability despite its lower O2&#8722; tolerance. Thus, the present work provides a novel design guideline for the development of LOB electrolytes.

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin derivatives that can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence (PL) over 60&#8197;min are reported and a mechanism for the phenomenon is proposed. The derivatives are used to synthesize supramolecular probes with peroxynitrite&#8208;activated PL and light&#8208;triggered imaging&#8208;modality transformation characteristics that permit improved biological uses.







Abstract
Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60&#8197;min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.

         <title>Biosynthetic Structural Proteins with Super Plasticity, Extraordinary Mechanical Performance, Biodegradability, Biocompatibility and Information Storage Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine&#8208;rich structural proteins were synthesized by a microbial system. The protein&#8208;based bioplastics showed super plasticity, extraordinary mechanical performance, desirable biodegradability, biocompatibility, structural stability, and data encoding ability. Information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in this new bioplastic system. This work offers a compelling prospect for developing a new generation of ecological materials.







Abstract
Degradable bioplastics have attracted growing interest worldwide. However, it is challenging to develop bioplastics with a simple processing procedure, strong mechanical performance, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physicochemical properties. Herein, we introduced structural proteins as building blocks and developed a simple environmentally friendly approach to fabricate diverse protein&#8208;based plastics. A cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;level production approach was developed through batch fermentation of Escherichia coli to produce the biomaterials. These bioplastics possess super plasticity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and high resistance to organic solvents. Their structural and mechanical properties can be precisely controlled. Besides, high density information storage and hemostatic applications were realized in the bioplastic system. The customizable bioplastics have great potential for applications in numerous fields and are capable to scale up to the industrial level.

         <title>Engineering Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photoenzymatic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled artificial photosynthesis system was constructed for photoenzymatic reduction of CO2 using COFs as enzyme carriers. The hybrid system showed an apparent quantum yield as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing the reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts of crystalline framework materials.







Abstract
It is of profound significance concerning the global energy and environmental crisis to develop new techniques that can reduce and convert CO2. To address this challenge, we built a new type of artificial photoenzymatic system for CO2 reduction, using a rationally designed mesoporous olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) as the porous solid carrier for co&#8208;immobilizing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and Rh&#8208;based electron mediator. By adjusting the incorporating content of the Rh electronic mediator, which facilitates the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) from NAD+, the apparent quantum yield can reach as high as 9.17&#177;0.44&#8201;%, surpassing all reported NADH&#8208;regenerated photocatalysts constructed by crystalline framework materials. Finally, the assembled photocatalyst&#8211;enzyme coupled system can selectively convert CO2 to formic acid with high efficiency and good reusability. This work demonstrates the first example using COFs to immobilize enzymes for artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Tuning Induced d&#8208;Band Center Modulation on Co&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides coupled with N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. The cation&#8208;tuning induced ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh corner&#8208;sharing effect enables the modulation and optimization of the electronic structure of Co&#8208;based spinel oxides, resulting in the superior electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Atomic substitutions at the tetrahedral site (ATd) could theoretically achieve an efficient optimization of the charge at the octahedral site (BOh) through the ATd&#8208;O&#8208;BOh interactions in the spinel oxides (AB2O4). Despite substantial progress having been made, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and use the spinel oxide composites (ACo2O4/NCNTs, A=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. The optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn&#8211;air battery equipped with a MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827&#8197;mAh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1 with a high power density of 74.63&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging&#8211;discharging rate (5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the modulation of the electronic structure accompanied with the movement of the d&#8208;band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn&#8722;O&#8722;Co, and the Co3+Oh of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows a more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Annulation of &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;ynones and Enals Enabled by Gold and Oxidative NHC Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented system of gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis was developed, which enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals to afford pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent level of enantioselectivity. The lactone products could be readily converted to diverse densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis that enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals. This method utilizes the in situ&#8208;generated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as a novel and versatile synthon, which engage with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium intermediates generated from enals by oxidative NHC catalysis to produce pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. Synthetic utility of the lactone products is also demonstrated by facile conversion to densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields with excellent stereopurity.

         <title>A Smart Theranostic Prodrug System Activated by Reactive Oxygen Species for Regional Chemotherapy of Metastatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers has been developed. The prodrug can selectively target cancer cells and be activated by highly expressed ROS, rapidly releasing drug with high efficiency. It shows significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy towards metastatic cancers (up to 99.9&#8201;%) with no obvious side effects.







Abstract
Metastatic cancer is difficult to cure because of its uncontrollable nature and side effects during treatment. We constructed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated smart theranostic prodrug system based on an ROS active site linked with both a targeting group and an anticancer drug for efficient regional chemotherapy of metastatic cancers. The optimized prodrug (Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT) with biotin as the targeting group displayed high sensitivity towards ROS and selectively targeting ability towards cervical cancer cells, showing highly efficient drug release (up to 92&#8201;%) in vitro. Bio&#8208;(8)&#8208;MB&#8208;CPT thus exerted strong toxicity towards cervical cancer cells, but unlike the parent drug (camptothecin), showed no toxicity towards normal cells. Moreover, the prodrug displayed significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy in vivo and eradicated the tumor with no obvious side effects (inhibition of the tumor reached up to 99.9&#8201;%).

         <title>Orthoquinone&#8211;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Ordered Channel Structures for Ultrahigh Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF)&#8722;BT&#8208;PTO COF cathode was designed and synthesized for aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries. The inherent ordered open channel structure facilitates ion transfer and insertion, thus making the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism with staged Zn2+, H+ co&#8208;insertion behavior and achieve ultra&#8208;fast kinetics and unprecedented cyclability.







Abstract
Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework with an ordered channel structures (BT&#8208;PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8211;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an exceptional long&#8208;term cyclability (retention rate 98.0&#8201;% at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;18&#8197;C) after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Moreover, a co&#8208;insertion mechanism with Zn2+ first followed by two H+ is uncovered for the first time. Significantly, this co&#8208;insertion behaviour evolves to more H+ insertion routes at high current density and gives the COF ultra&#8208;fast kinetics thus it achieves unprecedented specific power of 184&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF) and a high energy density of 92.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1(COF). Our work reports a superior organic material for zinc batteries and provides a design idea for future high&#8208;performance organic cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;A novel orthoquinone-based covalent organic framework (COF)&#8722;BT-PTO COF cathode was designed and synthesized for aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries. The inherent ordered open channel structure facilitates ion transfer and insertion, thus making the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism with staged Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-insertion behavior and achieve ultra-fast kinetics and unprecedented cyclability.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elaborate molecular design on cathodes is of great importance for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;organic batteries&#8217; performance elevation. Herein, we design a novel orthoquinone-based covalent organic framework with an ordered channel structures (BT-PTO COF) cathode for an ultrahigh performance aqueous zinc&#8211;organic battery. The ordered channel structure facilitates ions transfer and makes the COF follow a redox pseudocapacitance mechanism. Thus, it delivers a high reversible capacity of 225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an exceptional long-term cyclability (retention rate 98.0&#8201;% at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8776;18&#8197;C) after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Electrochemical Deposition of a Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanorod Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Film with Efficient Charge and Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical film deposition of a single&#8208;crystalline polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon on electrodes, with synthetically controlled crystal structure, film thickness, and crystal orientations is reported. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both charges and excitons, with a free carrier mobility over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a low exciton binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV, and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Electrochemical deposition has emerged as an efficient technique for preparing conjugated polymer films on electrodes. However, this method encounters difficulties in synthesizing crystalline products and controlling their orientation on electrodes. Here we report electrochemical film deposition of a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The film is composed of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods, in which the molecules adopt a cofacial stacking arrangement along the &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction. Film thickness and crystal size can be controlled by electrochemical conditions such as scan rate and electrolyte species, while the choice of anode material determines crystal orientation. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both free carriers and excitons: the free carrier mobility reaches over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas the excitons are delocalized with a low binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.

         <title>Gold (I/III)&#8208;Catalyzed Trifluoromethylthiolation and Trifluoromethylselenolation of Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first gold(I/III)&#8208;catalyzed direct trifluoromethylthiolation and trifluoromethylselenolation of organohalides are reported. This mild and efficient protocol enjoys a broad substrate scope and high yield (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). Its robustness was demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction applicable to pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.







Abstract
The first C&#8722;SCF3/SeCF3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions using gold redox catalysis [(MeDalphos)AuCl], AgSCF3 or Me4NSeCF3, and organohalides as substrates are reported. The new methodology enables a one&#8208;stop shop synthesis of aryl/alkenyl/alkynyl trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers with a broad substrate scope (&gt;60 examples with up to 97&#8201;% isolated yield). The method is scalable, and its robustness is evidenced by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, which makes this reaction an attractive alternative in the synthesis of trifluoromethylthio&#8208; and selenoethers for pharmaceutical and agrochemical research and development.

         <title>Interfacial Manganese&#8208;Doping in CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets by Employing a Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immiscible bi&#8208;phasic post&#8208;synthetic strategy for MnX2 (X=Br, Cl) doping in CsPbX3 perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is reported. The shuttle role of the electron&#8208;donor oleylamine at the water&#8211;hexane interface is the underlying reason for the MnX2 transport from the polar to nonpolar phase and its delivery to the NPls. Moreover, the halide anion plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ for the perovskite crystal structure.







Abstract
Mn&#8208;doping in cesium lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is of particular importance where strong quantum confinement plays a significant role towards the exciton&#8211;dopant coupling. In this work, we report an immiscible bi&#8208;phasic strategy for post&#8208;synthetic Mn&#8208;doping of CsPbX3 (X=Br, Cl) NPls. A systematic study shows that electron&#8208;donating oleylamine acts as a shuttle ligand to transport MnX2 through the water&#8211;hexane interface and deliver it to the NPls. The halide anion also plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn2+ and thus fulfilling the octahedral factor required for the formation of perovskite crystals. By varying the thickness of parent NPls, we can tune the dopant incorporation and, consequently, the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process in doped NPls. Time&#8208;resolved optical measurements offer a detailed insight into the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process. This new approach for post&#8208;synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar&#8211;nonpolar interface.

         <title>Electrochemical Fluorination of Vinyl Boronates through Donor&#8208;Stabilized Vinyl Carbocation Intermediates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl carbocations were generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of alkenyl boronates using electrical potentials. This electrochemical process enabled the formation of these reactive species without the use of Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids. The intermediate vinyl carbocations were trapped with nucleophilic fluoride sources to yield vinyl fluorides; the production of new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Br bonds was also demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrochemical generation of vinyl carbocations from alkenyl boronic esters and boronates is reported. Using easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nucleophilic fluoride reagents, these intermediates are trapped to form fully substituted vinyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies support the formation of dicoordinated carbocations through sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, this electrochemical fluorination features fast reaction times and Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions. This transformation provides a complementary method to access vinyl fluorides with simple fluoride salts such as TBAF.

         <title>Modulating the Frontier Orbitals of an Aluminylene for Facile Dearomatization of Inert Arenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene at an electron&#8208;deficient aluminylene center can remarkably boost the redox property of the aluminylene via modulation of frontier orbitals. This allows for facile dearomatization of inert arenes via either [4+1] cycloadditions or cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
Lewis bases are well known to stabilize electron&#8208;deficient species. We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene 1 featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of 1 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminylene 2, which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to 1, 2 readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Strikingly, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in 2 also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds of inert arenes in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion affording 3 and 5. The formation of 5 represents the first example of the cleavage of an aromatic C(3)&#8722;C(4) bond in biphenylene by a single&#8208;atom center.

         <title>An Overlooked Pathway in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Diazoalkanes with Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most popular illustration of the role of Frontier Molecular Orbitals (FMO) in 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions must be revised: the reactions of diazoacetates with enamines proceed stepwise and are controlled by interactions of the enamines&#8217; HOMO with &#960;*N=N (LUMO) and not with the unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl fragment (LUMO+1). Tautomers of the intermediate zwitterions have been observed and the mechanism studied by DFT computations.







Abstract
Methyl diazoacetate reacts with 1&#8208;(N&#8208;pyrrolidino)cycloalkenes to give products of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and azo couplings. The kinetics and mechanisms of these reactions were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;systems in the 1,3&#8208;dipoles of the propargyl&#8208;allenyl type allow for two separate reaction pathways for the (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions. The commonly considered concerted pathway is rationalized by the interaction of the enamine HOMO with LUMO+1, the lowest unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl anion fragment of methyl diazoacetate. We show that HOMO/LUMO(&#960;*N=N) interactions between enamines and methyl diazoacetate open a previously unrecognized reaction path for stepwise cycloadditions through zwitterionic intermediates with barriers approximately 40&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in energy in CHCl3 (DFT calculations) than for the concerted path.

         <title>Controlled Uptake of an Iridium Complex inside Engineered apo&#8208;Ferritin Nanocages: Study of Structure and Catalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable hybrid bio&#8208;nanocage with selective immobilization of an iridium complex inside the self&#8208;assembly protein, ferritin has been developed. These hybrid bio&#8208;catalysts reduce substituted acetophenones into the corresponding chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo&#8208;rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site&#8208;specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5&#8208;fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild&#8208;type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir&#8208;embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild&#8208;type analogue. These hybrid bio&#8208;nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming the corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88&#8201;% conversion and 70&#8201;% enantioselectivity. An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the reactant enhanced the Turnover frequency of the reaction. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the substrate binds in different orientations at the active site in different mutants of the nanocage.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Furfural in Aqueous Acetic Acid Media with Enhanced 2&#8208;Methylfuran Selectivity Using CuPd Bimetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Pd enhanced the selectivity of Cu catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran in an aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acidic acid solution. The origin of the superior performance was revealed by in&#8197;situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic measurements and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of CuPd catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF or FurCH3 where Fur=furyl) in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acetic acid (pH&#8197;2.9). The highest faradaic efficiency (FE) for MF reached 75&#8201;% at &#8722;0.58&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode with an average partial current density of 4.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic experiments suggested that electrogenerated adsorbed hydrogen (Hads) was involved in the reaction and incorporation of Pd enhanced the surface coverage of Hads and optimized the adsorption pattern of furfural, leading to a higher FE for MF. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pd incorporation reduced the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of FurCH2* to FurCH3*. Our study demonstrates that catalyst surface structure/composition plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity in ECH and provides a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for ECH of bio&#8208;derived oxygenates.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Terpenoid&#8211;Pyrrolobenzoxazine Hybrid Natural Product CJ&#8208;12662</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid CJ&#8208;12662 has been uncovered. In particular, the biosynthesis involves two different oxidation strategies (one&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron oxidation routes) for the modification of each unit, reflecting its chemical reactivity. Finally, ThmM catalyzes the formation of the N&#8208;oxide, which undergoes a [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement to form the unique pyrrolobenzoxazine structure.







Abstract
The fungal natural product CJ&#8208;12662 is a structurally complex terpene&#8211;amino acid hybrid, and is a potent anthelmintic compound. The biosynthetic pathway of CJ&#8208;12662 is elucidated based on metabolite analysis from heterologous expression. We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations of amorpha&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene, while three flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]&#8208;Meisenheimer rearrangement.

We demonstrate the terpene portion is derived from successive P450-catalyzed oxidations of amorpha-4,11-diene, while three flavin-dependent enzymes are involved in morphing the esterified tryptophan into a chlorinated pyrrolobenzoxazine, utilizing a cascaded [1,2]-Meisenheimer rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structures of Silver Fingers and a Pathway to Their Genotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative AgI binding to CCHH zinc fingers causes zinc ion release followed by a collapse of the stable secondary structure and formation of a highly stable Ag2S2 cluster. CCHC, CCCH and CCCC zinc fingers react analogously. Such silver&#8208;induced perturbation inhibits binding of the CCHH zinc finger protein to its cognate DNA sequence and as a consequence may affect many cellular processes including transcriptional regulation.







Abstract
Recently, we demonstrated that AgI can directly replace ZnII in zinc fingers (ZFs). The cooperative binding of AgI to ZFs leads to a thermodynamically irreversible formation of silver clusters destroying the native ZF structure. Thus, a reported loss of biological function of ZF proteins is a likely consequence of such replacement. Here, we report an X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of AgnSn clusters formed in ZFs to probe their structural features. Selective probing of the local environment around AgI by XAS showed the predominance of digonal AgI coordination to two sulfur donors, coordinated with an average Ag&#8722;S distance at 2.41&#8197;&#197;. No Ag&#8722;N bonds were present. A mixed AgS2/AgS3 geometry was found solely in the CCCH AgI&#8722;ZF. We also show that cooperative replacement of ZnII ions with the studied Ag2S2 clusters occurred in a three&#8208;ZF transcription factor protein 1MEY#, leading to a dissociation of 1MEY# from the complex with its cognate DNA.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Fluorescent Spherical Nucleic Acids Self&#8208;Assembled from a DNA&#8208;Grafted Conjugated Polymer for Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted conjugated polymer (PFBT&#8208;g&#8208;DNA) is synthesized and assembles into fluorescent spherical nucleic acids (FCP&#8208;SNAs) with excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability. Since the FCP&#8208;SNAs can efficiently &#8220;pump&#8221; the collected energy to the receptor, showing exceptional signal transduction ability, they are applied to detect the ultralow concentration of nucleic acid down to 1.7&#8197;pM.







Abstract
The ultralow concentration of nucleic acids in complex biological samples requires fluorescence probes with high specificity and sensitivity. Herein, a new kind of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) is developed by using fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) as a light&#8208;harvesting antenna to enhance the signal transduction of nucleic acid detection. Specifically, amphiphilic DNA&#8208;grafted FCPs are synthesized and self&#8208;assemble into FCP&#8208;SNA structures. Tuning the hydrophobicity of the graft copolymer can adjust the size and light&#8208;harvesting capability of the FCP&#8208;SNAs. We observe that more efficient signal amplification occurs in larger FCP&#8208;SNAs, as more chromophores are involved, and the energy transfer can go beyond the F&#246;rster radius. Accordingly, the optimized FCP&#8208;SNA shows an antenna effect of up to 37&#8208;fold signal amplification and the limit of detection down to 1.7&#8197;pM in microRNA detection. Consequently, the FCP&#8208;SNA is applied to amplified in situ nucleic acid detecting and imaging at the single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>HFIP Mediates a Direct C&#8722;C Coupling between Michael Acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Michael Acceptors efficiently couple with Eschenmoser's salt in hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) without the need for additives or catalysts. The role of iodide and the solvent HFIP in this transformation have been studied in detail experimentally and computationally to obtain a full mechanistic picture. The products were further transformed through rearrangements and Michael additions.







Abstract
A direct C&#8722;C coupling process that merges Michael acceptors and Eschenmoser's salt is presented. Although reminiscent of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction, this process requires no Lewis base catalyst. The underlying mechanism was unveiled by a combination of kinetic, isotopic labelling experiments as well as computational investigations, which showcased the critical role of HFIP as a superior mediator for proton&#8208;transfer events as well as the decisive role of the halide counterion.

A series of rotaxane&#8208;based catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an NDI&#8208;containing axle is intrinsic to their activity is reported. Computational analysis suggests that the high selectivity observed (&gt;60 fold for Michael addition over a competing decarboxylation pathway) is due to &#960;&#8208;stacking of the mechanically bonded components that leads to high polarizability.







Abstract
We report a series of rotaxane&#8208;based anion&#8211;&#960; catalysts in which the mechanical bond between a bipyridine macrocycle and an axle containing an NDI unit is intrinsic to the activity observed, including a [3]rotaxane that catalyses an otherwise disfavoured Michael addition in &gt;60 fold selectivity over a competing decarboxylation pathway that dominates under Br&#248;nsted base conditions. The results are rationalized by detailed experimental investigations, electrochemical and computational analysis.

         <title>Accelerated Mechanochemistry in Helical Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When polymer chains are stressed in solution, mechanochemistry is accelerated if helical conformations are present in the chain, as measured using a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and the use of rhodamine mechanophore activation. This phenomenon is explained by the increased persistence length in helical polymers, leading to more efficient energy transduction.







Abstract
Polymer chains, if long enough, are known to undergo bond scission when mechanically stressed. While the mechanochemical response of random coils is well understood, biopolymers and some key synthetic chains adopt well&#8208;defined secondary structures such as helices. To understand covalent mechanochemistry in such structures, poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl glutamates) are prepared while regulating the feed&#8208;monomer chirality, producing chains with similar molecular weights and backbone chemistry but different helicities. Such chains are stressed in solution and their mechanochemistry rates compared by following molecular weight change and using a rhodamine mechanochromophore. Results reveal that while helicity itself is not affected by the covalent bond scissions, chains with higher helicity undergo faster mechanochemistry. Considering that the polymers tested differ only in conformation, these results indicate that helix&#8208;induced chain rigidity improves the efficiency of mechanical energy transduction.

         <title>Tailoring a Near&#8208;Infrared Macrocyclization Scaffold Allows the Control of In Situ Self&#8208;assembly for Photoacoustic/PET Bimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;triggered macrocyclization and in situ self&#8208;assembly of small molecules into nanoparticles has shown promise to design activatable probes for molecular imaging. However, controlling macrocyclization and self&#8208;assembly to concurrently augment positron emission tomography (PET) and photoacoustic (PA) signals for bimodality imaging is challenging. Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole&#8208;IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self&#8208;assembly and design a caspase&#8208;3&#8208;activatable PA/PET bimodal probe (  [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1  ) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high&#8208;sensitivity whole&#8208;body imaging signals offered by PET with the high&#8208;resolution imaging signals offered by PA,  [18F]&#8208;IR780&#8208;1  can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful to optimize the therapeutic protocol for patients. This scaffold may be adopted to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging.</dc:description>

Herein, we report the engineering of a triazole-IR780 fluorophore as a versatile macrocyclization scaffold for controlling in situ self-assembly and design a caspase-3-activatable PA/PET bimodal probe (  [18F]-IR780-1  ) for in vivo imaging of tumor apoptosis. By leveraging the high-sensitivity whole-body imaging signals offered by PET with the high-resolution imaging signals offered by PA,  [18F]-IR780-1  can provide a promising tool for the early evaluation of antitumor efficacy, helpful to optimize the therapeutic protocol for patients.

         <title>Efficient Polyester Hydrogenolytic Deconstruction via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commodity polyester plastics such as PET, PBT, and PEN are hydrogenolytically deconstructed to their starting monomeric carboxylic acids and light alkanes using a solventless tandem catalytic approach with two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable catalysts, Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C. These selective reactions operate near the polymer melting temperature under 1 atm H2 and are compatible with mixed plastics, as reported by Yosi Kratish and Tobin&#8197;J. Marks in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112576).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable elastomers with dynamic covalent bonds are of paramount significance for emerging applications such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116219), Ling Wang, Wei Feng et&#8197;al. demonstrate mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain chiral liquid crystalline polymer networks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D&#8208;helical structure of a non&#8208;symmetric poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) with dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is reported in the Research Article by F&#233;lix Freire et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115070). By conformational changes in the pendant group a helix inversion in the PDPA can be initiated, creating a CPL switch.

         <title>The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic fluorophores in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) range have been validated as attractive imaging tools in biomedical research owing to their biocompatibility, flexible chemical structure, and tunable spectra. This Review systematically summarizes recent advances in the chemistry, design principles, and optical properties of NIR&#8208;II organic contrast agents.







Abstract
Optical imaging, especially fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, is a non&#8208;invasive imaging approach with high spatial and temporal resolution and high sensitivity, compared to positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the merits of imaging using the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, like deeper penetration depth, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, high resolution, and low tissue damage, researchers have devoted great effort to developing contrast agents with NIR&#8208;II absorption or emission. In this Review, we summarize recently developed organic luminescent and photoacoustic materials, ranging from small molecules to conjugated polymers. Then, we systematically introduce engineering strategies and describe the imaging performance classified by the skeleton cores. Finally, we elucidate the challenges and prospects of these NIR&#8208;II organic dyes for potential clinical applications. We expect our summary can inspire researchers to expand the spectrum of NIR&#8208;II contrast agents for diverse bioapplications.

We expect our summary can inspire researchers to expand the spectrum of NIR-II contrast agents for diverse bioapplications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wound biofilms are a challenging problem for modern medicine. Advances in the areas of sensors and reporters that can accurately detect early biofilm formation in the wound, and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offer promise for better detection and treatment. This review focuses on novel approaches to biofilm eradication and detection and compares them to conventional methods.







Abstract
Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.

         <title>Global Analysis of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive analysis of the mechanical properties of organic crystals has determined the limits of their mechanical performance as a separate class of engineering materials. This Minireview also explores the reasons for the softness of organic crystals.







Abstract
Organic crystals, although widely studied, have not been considered nascent candidate materials in engineering design. Here we summarize the mechanical properties of organic crystals that have been reported over the past three decades, and we establish a global mechanical property profile that can be used to predict and identify mechanically robust organic crystals. Being composed of light elements, organic crystals populate a narrow region in the mechanical property&#8211;density space between soft, disordered organic materials and stiff, ordered materials. Two subsets of extraordinarily stiff and hard organic crystalline materials were identified and rationalized by the normalized number density, strength, and directionality of their intermolecular interactions. We conclude that future lightweight, soft, all&#8208;organic components in devices should capitalize on the greatest asset of organic single crystals&#8212;namely, the combination of long&#8208;range structural order and softness.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Semisynthesis of Lipidated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipidation is a co&#8208; and post&#8208;translational modification that is known to influence the structure, function, and localization of peptides and proteins. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of modern synthetic and semisynthetic methods for the generation of homogeneously lipidated proteins that have underpinned the study of the effects of lipid modifications on protein structure and function with unprecedented precision.







Abstract
Lipidation is a ubiquitous modification of peptides and proteins that can occur either co&#8208; or post&#8208;translationally. An array of different lipid classes can adorn proteins and has been shown to influence a number of crucial biological activities, including the regulation of signaling, cell&#8211;cell adhesion events, and the anchoring of proteins to lipid rafts and phospholipid membranes. Whereas nature employs a range of enzymes to install lipid modifications onto proteins, the use of these for the chemoenzymatic generation of lipidated proteins is often inefficient or impractical. An alternative is to harness the power of modern synthetic and semisynthetic technologies to access lipid&#8208;modified proteins in a pure and homogeneously modified form. This Review aims to highlight significant advances in the development of lipidation and ligation chemistry and their implementation in the synthesis and semisynthesis of homogeneous lipidated proteins that have enabled the influence of these modifications on protein structure and function to be uncovered.

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B has been solved at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;, providing an accurate structural basis for the mechanistic study of endoperoxide formation. The binding conformation of fumitremorgin&#8197;B in this structure is different from any previously docked structures. Structural analysis and multiscale calculations revealed that Y68 radical is key to endoperoxidation.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme enzyme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined owing to the lack of a reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin&#8197;B. Herein we provide the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8901;2OG&#8901;fumitremorgin&#8197;B at a resolution of 1.22&#8197;&#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin&#8197;B induces significant compression of the active pocket and that Y68 is in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support a CarC&#8208;like mechanism, in which Y68 acts as the H&#8197;atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our results are consistent with all available experimental data and highlight the importance of accurate complex structures in the mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.

         <title>Anti&#8208;cooperative Self&#8208;Assembly with Maintained Emission Regulated by Conformational and Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a strategy to enable a maintained emissive behavior in the self&#8208;assembled state by enforcing an anti&#8208;cooperative self&#8208;assembly involving weak intermolecular dye interactions. To achieve this goal, we designed a conformationally flexible monomer unit  1  with a central 1,3&#8208;substituted (diphenyl)urea hydrogen bonding synthon that is tethered to two BODIPY dyes featuring sterically bulky trialkoxybenzene substituents at the  meso  &#8208;position. The competition between attractive forces (H&#8208;bonding and aromatic interactions) and destabilizing effects (steric and competing conformational effects) limits the assembly, halting the supramolecular growth at the stage of small oligomers. Given the presence of weak dye&#8208;dye interactions, the emission properties of molecularly dissolved  1  are negligibly affected upon aggregation. Our findings contribute to broadening the scope of emissive supramolecular assemblies and controlled supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Bulk O2 and Nonbonding Oxygen State for Reversible Anionic Redox Chemistry in P2&#8208;Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the reversibility of oxygen redox is quite significant for layered oxides cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we for the first time simultaneously tune bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for reversible oxygen redox chemistry in P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co&#8208;doping. O2&#8208; is oxidized to molecular O2 and peroxide (O&#173;2)n&#8208; (n &lt; 2) during charging. Molecular O2 derived from transition metal (TM) migration is related to the superstructure ordering induced by Li doping. The synergy mechanism of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/ Ti co&#8208;doping on the two O&#8208;redox modes is revealed. Firstly, Li2TiO3 coating restrains the surface O2 and inhibits O2 loss.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Improving the reversibility of oxygen redox is quite significant for layered oxides cathodes in sodium-ion batteries. Herein, we for the first time simultaneously tune bulk O2 and nonbonding oxygen state for reversible oxygen redox chemistry in P2-Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 through a synergy of Li2TiO3 coating and Li/Ti co-doping. O2- is oxidized to molecular O2 and peroxide (O&#173;2)n- (n &amp;lt; 2) during charging.

         <title>1D/2D/3D Reversible Dimensional Transformation in Cu(II) Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reversible transformation between 1D, 2D, and 3D is demonstrated for the first time in coordination polymers comprising Cu(II) ions and bidentate terephthalate (BDC  2&#8211;  ). 1D uniform chains were reversibly transformed into 2D layers with the construction of Cupaddlewheels by eliminating water molecules. 2D/3D reversible transformation was achieved by removing/rebinding  N  ,  N&#8208;  dimethylformamide coordinated to the paddlewheels. These dimensional transformations significantly changed chemical and physical properties such as gas sorption and magnetism. Although the uptake in open&#8208;framework 1D and 2D Cu&#8208;BDC was insignificant, pronounced absorption was observed for 3D Cu&#8208;BDC. Drastic difference in magnetic behavior is consistent with their coordination structures; uniform 1D chain of Cu(II) in 1D Cu&#8208;BDC and 2D sheet based on Cu(II)&#8208;paddlewheel dimers in 2D Cu&#8208;BDC. Ferromagnetic behavior observed in air&#8208;exposed 3D Cu&#8208;BDC is attributed to the 3D structure formed by the connection of 2D sheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Record Aluminum Molecular Rings for Optical Limiting and Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline cluster materials, a class of functional motif aggregations, provide a great opportunity for tuning the properties stemming from the flexible and accurate variation of inorganic and organic compositions. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of functional ligand and ring size regulation on the structures and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Revealed by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis results, aluminum molecular ring expansion is achieved by 2 &#215; 9 and 3 &#215; 6 strategies. In terms of the given organic shells, we further tuned the aluminum molecular ring sizes from 3.0 nm to 1.7 nm. The picosecond Z&#8208;scan measurements results revealed that the third&#8208;order NLO performances do not only depend on the general conjugate interactions but are also related to hydrogen bonding, polarizability, and ring sizes. The large nonlinear absorption coefficient and onset prove that the observed samples are promising candidates for the field of nonlinear optics field.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via PdII/PdIV Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to access 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles from non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides and ambiphilic organohalides is described. Under PdII/PdIV catalysis, this [n+2] annulation proceeds in an anti&#8208;selective fashion and tolerates a wide array of ambiphiles, which are systematically benchmarked with respect to nucleophile identity, electrophile identity, and product ring&#8208;size. Otherwise unreactive ambiphilic ortho&#8208;haloacetophenones can be activated using an amine co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under PdII/PdIV catalysis. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [n+2] (n=3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through PdII/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct PdII/PdIV mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This difference results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.

         <title>Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry Reveals Sex Difference in Vesicular Storage and Release of Catecholamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitative measurements of sex difference in vesicle chemistry (i.e., chemical storage and release) at a single vesicle level are very essential to understand sex differences in cognitive behaviors; however, such measurements are very challenging to conventional analytical methods. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the duration of single exocytotic events of chromaffin cells prepared from male rats is statistically longer than that from female rats, leading to more neurotransmitter released in male group. Further analysis reveals that a higher percentage of vesicles in female group release part of neurotransmitter, i.e., partial release, during exocytosis than that in male group. This sex dimorphism in neurotransmitter release in exocytosis might relate to the sex difference in the expression of voltage&#8208;dependent calcium channels and membrane lipid composition. Our finding offers the first experimental evidence that sex dimorphism even exists in vesicle chemistry, providing a brand new viewpoint for understanding the sex dimorphism in cognitive behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Arylation of Tertiary C&#8210;H Bonds of Cyclobutylmethyl Ketones Using Transient Directing Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first example of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed selective tertiary C&#8722;H activation of cyclobutylmethyl ketones using a transient directing group. The electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is identified as an external ligand to enable tertiary C&#8722;H activation. A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers were readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81% yield and &gt;95:5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8210;H arylation to &#946;&#8208;methylene (&#946;&#8208;methyl) or &#947;&#8208;C&#8210;H arylation. In the presence of a &#946;&#8208;methyl C&#8210;H bond, the desired arylation of the tertiary C&#8211;H bond can still proceed as the predominant pathway.</dc:description>

A variety of cyclobutylmethyl ketones bearing quaternary carbon centers were readily accessed without preinstalling internal directing groups in up to 81% yield and &amp;gt;95:5 regioisomeric ratios of tertiary C&#8210;H arylation to &#946;-methylene (&#946;-methyl) or &#947;-C&#8210;H arylation. In the presence of a &#946;-methyl C&#8210;H bond, the desired arylation of the tertiary C&#8211;H bond can still proceed as the predominant pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote C(sp3)&#8208;H Acylation of Amides and Cascade Cyclization via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of inert C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds under environmentally benign catalytic conditions remains a challenging task in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report an organocatalytic remote C(sp  3  )&#8208;H acylation of amides and cascade cyclization through a radical&#8208;mediated 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism using  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the catalyst. Notably, a diversity of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates, including simple linear aliphatic carbamates and  ortho  &#8208;alkyl benzamides, can be successfully applied to this organocatalytic system. With the established protocol, over 120 examples of functionalized &#948;&#8208;amino ketones and isoquinolinones with diverse substituents were facilely synthesized in up to 99% yield under mild conditions. The robustness and generality of the organocatalytic strategy was further highlighted by the successful acylation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds and late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceutical molecules. The attempt for asymmetric control of the radical reaction proved to be feasible by using a newly designed chiral thiazolium catalyst, and moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at the current stage. Preliminary mechanistic investigations including several control reactions, KIE experiments, and computational studies shed light on the organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to a Labile Monomeric Magnesium Radical by Ball&#8208;Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to isolate a monometallic Mg radical, the precursor (Am)MgI&#183;(CAAC) (  1  ) was prepared (Am =  t  BuC(N&#8208;DIPP)  2  , DIPP = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, CAAC = cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene). Reduction of a solution of  1  in toluene with the reducing agent K/KI led to formation of a deep purple complex that rapidly decomposed. Ball&#8208;milling of  1  with K/KI gave the low&#8208;valent Mg(I) complex (Am)Mg&#183;(CAAC) (  2  ) which after rapid extraction with pentane and crystallization was isolated in 15% yield. Although a benzene solution of  2  decomposes rapidly to give Mg(Am)  2  (  3  ) and unidentified products, the radical is stable in the solid state. Its crystal structure shows planar trigonal coordination at Mg. The extremely short Mg&#8208;C distance of 2.056(2) &#197; indicates strong Mg&#8208;CAAC bonding. Calculations and EPR measurements show that most of the spin density is in a p* orbital located at the C&#8208;N bond in CAAC, leading to significant C&#8208;N bond elongation. This is supported by calculated NPA charges in  2  : Mg +1.73, CAAC &#8208;0.82. Similar metal&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer was calculated for M  0  (CAAC)  2  and [M  I  (CAAC)  2  +  ] (M = Be, Mg, Ca) complexes in which the metal charges range from +1.50 to +1.70. Although the spin density of the radical is mainly located at the CAAC ligand, complex  2  reacts as a low&#8208;valent Mg(I) complex: reaction with a I  2  solution in toluene gave (Am)MgI&#183;(CAAC) (  1  ) as the major product.</dc:description>

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) fluorescent macrocycles (  3a  and  3b  ) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The Pt(II) macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (  3a  a  and  3b  a  ) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY).&#160; In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Encoding Enantiomeric Molecular Chiralities on Graphene Basal Planes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene has demonstrated broad applications due to its prominent properties. Its molecular structure makes graphene achiral. Here, we propose a direct way to prepare chiral graphene by transferring chiral structural conformation from chiral conjugated amino acids onto graphene basal plane through &#928;&#8208;&#928; interaction followed by thermal fusion. Using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy, we estimated an areal coverage of the molecular imprints (chiral regions) up to 64% on the basal plane of graphene (grown by chemical vapor deposition). The high concentration of molecular imprints in their single layer points to a close packing of the deposited amino acid molecules prior to &#8220;thermal fusion&#8221;. Such &#8220;molecular chirality&#8208;encoded graphene&#8221; was tested as an electrode in electrochemical enantioselective recognition. The chirality&#8208;encoded graphene might find use for other chirality&#8208;related studies and the encoding procedure might be extended to other two&#8208;dimensional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Widefield SERS for High&#8208;Throughput Nanoparticle Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle&#8208;characterization, which is 500&#8208;1000 times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample&#8217;s Raman and Rayleigh scattering, allowing for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with the particle&#8208;size and to directly quantify the fraction of SERS active particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Catalytic C&#8208;Glycosylation of Arenes: Expeditious Synthesis of the Remdesivir Nucleoside**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars is presented. A silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which are cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The utility of the method is showcased in the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 by a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.







Abstract
Since early 2020, scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, in particular by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body. The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stages of the infection. However, the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups, air&#8208;sensitive reagents, and cryogenic conditions, thus impeding a cost&#8208;efficient supply to patients. We have, therefore, focused on the development of a straightforward, direct addition of (hetero)arenes to unprotected sugars. Here we report a silylium&#8208;catalyzed and completely stereoselective C&#8208;glycosylation that initially yields the open&#8208;chain polyols, which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic &#945;&#8208;furanose or the thermodynamically favored &#946;&#8208;anomer. The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS&#8208;441524 after a subsequent Mn&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxidation and deoxycyanation.

         <title>Accelerating Radiative Decay in Blue Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters by Minimizing the Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorophores are constructed with strong through&#8208;space donor&#8211;acceptor interactions by minimizing their face&#8208;to&#8208;face distance of 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, realizing efficient blue emission and fast radiative decay. The materials show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with relieved efficiency roll&#8208;off and CIEy coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15, when used as emitter and sensitizer in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorophors (TADF) featuring through&#8208;space charge transfers (TSCT) suffer from low radiative decay rates (krs), especially for blue emitters. Here, a xanthene bridge is adopted to construct space&#8208;confined face&#8208;to&#8208;face donor&#8211;acceptor alignment and minimize their distances down to 2.7&#8211;2.8&#8197;&#197;, even shorter than the interlayer distance of graphite and thus strengthening the electronic interactions. The resulting blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters exhibit peaks around &#8776;460&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;90&#8201;%, and krs of nearly 107&#8197;s&#8722;1, almost 2&#8211;10&#8197;times higher than previously observed values with comparable reverse intersystem crossing rates. The corresponding blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show maximum external quantum efficiencies of 27.8&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinates of 0.29 and 0.15 using those molecules as emitters and sensitizers, respectively.

         <title>CLIPON: A CRISPR&#8208;Enabled Strategy that Turns Commercial Pregnancy Test Strips into General Point&#8208;of&#8208;Need Test Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational integration of the human chorionic gonadotropin, CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a/crRNA system, and large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies, a portable sensing platform termed CLIPON has been developed, which can transduce both nucleic acid and non&#8208;nucleic acid targets into commercial pregnancy test strip readout. The detection is sensitive, selective, instrument&#8208;free, and allows future integration into a microchip.







Abstract
Desirable biosensing assays need to be sensitive, specific, cost&#8208;effective, instrument&#8208;free, and versatile. Herein we report a new strategy termed CLIPON (CRISPR and Large DNA assembly Induced Pregnancy strips for signal&#8208;ON detection) that can deliver these traits. CLIPON integrates a commercial pregnancy test strip (PTS) with four biological elements: the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a, crRNA and cauliflower&#8208;like large&#8208;sized DNA assemblies (CLD). CLIPON uses the Cas12a/crRNA complex both to recognize a target of interest and to release CLD&#8208;bound hCG so that target presence can translate into a colorimetric signal on the PTS. We demonstrate the versatility of CLIPON through sensitive and specific detection of HPV genomic DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA and adenosine. We also engineer a cell phone app and a hand&#8208;held microchip to achieve signal quantification. CLIPON represents an attractive option for biosensing and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylcyanation of Ynamides: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Access to Tetrasubstituted 3&#8208;Silyl&#8208;2&#8208;Aminoacrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles (&#945;&#8208;enaminonitriles) are underinvestigated building blocks due to the lack of methodologies to synthesize them in a controlled manner. A general access to these valuable scaffolds accompanied by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations is described. This highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective strategy relies on the use of the first intermolecular silylcyanation of ynamides.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed silylcyanation of ynamides is described. This reaction is fully regioselective, delivering tetrasubstituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles derivatives exclusively. Unexpectedly, the nature (aryl or alkyl) of the substituent located at the &#946;&#8208;position of the ynamide directly controls the stereoselectivity. The reaction tolerates a number of functional groups and can be considered as the first general access to fully substituted 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles. Given the singular reactivity observed, a computational study was performed to shed light on the mechanism of this intriguing transformation. Relying on the specific reactivity of the newly installed vinylsilane functionality, the scope of 2&#8208;aminoacrylonitriles has been enlarged by postfunctionalization.

         <title>Coordinating the Mechanisms of Action of Ferroptosis and the Photothermal Effect for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cancer theranostic nanomedicine (denoted as Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA) was designed by attentively considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect to promote maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects in combination therapy. The pH/GSH&#8208;responsive therapeutic and imaging characteristics of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles in the tumor enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Combination therapy based on different mechanisms of cell death has shown promise in tumor therapy. However, when different modalities are integrated, the maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects is often lacking in the design. Herein, we report a cancer theranostic nanomedicine formula developed by considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect in combination therapy. The croconaine molecule was encapsulated as both a photothermal converter and an iron&#8208;chelating agent with BSA, thus leading to biocompatible and stable Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles (NPs). The Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs in the tumor milieu showed an activated photothermal effect leading to enhanced radical formation owing to the temperature&#8208;dependent Fenton reaction kinetics, while radical formation during ferroptosis in turn prevented the heat&#8208;induced formation of heat shock proteins and thus the self&#8208;protection mechanism of cancer cells in response to heat. The activatable photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging performance of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs also enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.

         <title>A Class of Rigid&#8211;Flexible Coupling Crystalline Crosslinked Polymers as Vapomechanical Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers is fabricated for the first time. The polymers can form self&#8208;standing membranes showing outstanding vapomechanically responsive performance.







Abstract
Fabricating mechanically responsive actuators that can efficiently convert external stimuli into mechanical work is of great significance for real&#8208;world applications. Herein, we rationally design a class of rigid&#8211;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers (CCPs) to fabricate vapomechanically responsive actuators. Interfacial condensation reactions of flexible macromers with rigid monomers afford a series of freestanding CCP membranes. Notably, it is the first example where crosslinked polymers show high crystallinity and porosity. Moreover, the CCP membranes exhibit good mechanical properties and interesting vapor&#8208;triggered actuation performance, which is reversible and repeatable. We find that the unusual polymer structures, high vapor sorption, and anisotropic membranes contribute to the directional deformation performance of the CCP actuators. The synthesis approach in this work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of smart materials for advanced applications.

         <title>A Descriptor for Accurate Predictions of Host Molecules Enabling Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although doping can induce room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in heavy&#8208;atom free organic systems, it is often challenging to match the host and guest components to achieve efficient intersystem crossing for activating RTP. In this work, we developed a simple descriptor &#916;  E  to predict host molecules for matching the guest RTP emitters, based on the intersystem crossing  via  higher excited states (ISCHES) mechanism. This descriptor successfully predicted five commercially available host components to pair with naphthalimide (NA) and naphtho[2,3&#8208;c]furan&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione (2,3&#8208;NA) emitters with high accuracy of 83%. The yielded pairs exhibited bright yellow and green RTP with the quantum efficiency up to 0.4 and lifetime up to 1.67 s, respectively. Using these RTP pairs, we successfully achieved multi&#8208;layer message encryption. The &#916;  E  descriptor could provide an efficient way for developing doping&#8208;induced RTP materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover is induced in self&#8208;assembled tetramers of a Co&#8208;complex on Ag(111) surfaces via the injection of electrons or holes with a scanning tunneling microscope. The resulting memristive current&#8211;voltage characteristic is analysed in terms of the electron transport through the molecular d&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
The Co&#8208;based complex [Co(H2B(pz)(pypz))2] (py=pyridine, pz=pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at &#8776;5&#8197;K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to S=1/2 and 3/2 spin states of the Co2+ complex. The image contrast and the orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (ELIESST).

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wavefunction analysis of phase&#8208;change materials in terms of interacting atomic orbitals reveals the decisive role of electron&#8208;rich multicenter interactions, similar yet different from the molecular case. The rather uncommon properties of these phases such as bond&#8208;breaking behavior and other structural peculiarities arise as a natural consequence of electron&#8208;rich multicenter bonding in condensed matter.







Abstract
Layered phase&#8208;change materials in the Ge&#8722;Sb&#8722;Te system are widely used in data storage and are the subject of intense research to understand the quantum&#8208;chemical origin of their unique properties. To uncover the nature of the underlying periodic wavefunction, we have studied the interacting atomic orbitals including their phases by means of crystal orbital bond index and fragment crystal orbital analysis. In full accord with findings based on projected force constants, we demonstrate the role of multicenter bonding along straight atomic connectivities. While the resulting multicenter bonding resembles three&#8208;center&#8208;four&#8208;electron bonding in molecules, its solid&#8208;state manifestation leads to distinct long&#8208;range consequences, thus serving to contextualize the material properties usually termed &#8220;metavalent&#8221;. Eventually we suggest multicenter bonding to be the origin of their astonishing bond&#8208;breaking and phase&#8208;change behavior, as well as the too small &#8220;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8221; gaps between individual layers.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery with a Wide Operation&#8208;Temperature Range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>

         <dc:description>
A wide&#8208;temperature range sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB), which involves a Bi anode, a NFPP@C cathode and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte is successfully fabricated. Owing to the solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism of the Bi anode, the high Na+ diffusion coefficient of the NFPP@C cathode at low temperature and the electrolyte with a high boiling point and low freezing point, the prepared SIB can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C.

Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions. However, the all&#8208;weather SIBs with a wide operation&#8208;temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature range SIB, which involves a carbon&#8208;coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na+ can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de&#8208;solvent process. Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na+ diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low&#8208;temperature behavior. Even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, this battery still delivers 70.19&#8201;% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature of up to 100&#8201;&#176;C. These results are encouraging for the further exploration of wide&#8208;temperature range SIBs.

&lt;p&gt;A wide-temperature range sodium-ion battery (SIB), which involves a Bi anode, a NFPP@C cathode and a diglyme-based electrolyte is successfully fabricated.

         <title>Regulation of High Miscibility for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transport in n&#8208;doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong interchain interactions of conjugated polymers usually result in poor miscibility with molecular dopants, limiting the doping efficiency because of uncontrolled phase separation. We develop a strategy to achieve efficient charge&#8208;transport and high doping miscibility in n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers. We solve the miscibility issue through disorder side&#8208;chains containing dopants better. Systemic structural characterization reveals a farther side&#8208;chain branching point will lead to higher disorders, which provides appropriate sites to accommodate extrinsic molecular dopants without harming original chain packings and charge&#8208;transport channels. Therefore, better sustainability of solid&#8208;state microstructure is obtained, yielding a stable conductivity even when overloading massive dopants. This work highlights the importance of realizing high host&#8211;dopant miscibility in molecular doping of conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Local Atomic Environments of Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Production of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination engineering strategy based on a p&#8208;block In single&#8208;atom catalyst with N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination on hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC) has been developed. DFT results and electrochemical analysis show a superior 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction performance of the In SAs/NSBC catalyst in alkaline and neutral solutions, which is ascribed to synergistic effects between first&#8208;coordinated N/S, second&#8208;coordinated B, and single In atoms.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth understanding of local atomic environment&#8211;property relationships of p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalysts toward the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has rarely been reported. Here, guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom&#8208;modified In&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N,S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC). The In SAs/NSBC catalyst exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95&#8201;% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC&#8208;modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49&#8197;mol peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and 6.71&#8197;mol&#8201;peroxide&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M PBS electrolyte. This strategy enables the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials, and provides practical guidance for H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization Organocatalysis: From Monomer Mixtures to Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;pot production of sequence&#8208;controlled block copolymer from mixed monomers is a crucial but rarely reached goal. Using a switchable Lewis&#8208;Pair organocatalyst, we have accomplished sequence&#8208;selective polymerization from a mixture of  O  &#8208;carboxyanhydride (OCA) and epoxide. Polymerization of OCA monomer occurs first and exclusively because of its exceedingly high polymerizability. When OCA is fully consumed, alternating copolymerization of epoxide and CO  2  liberated in OCA polymerization is triggered from the termini of the first block. The two polymerizations thus occur tandemly, both in chemoselective fashions, so that sequence&#8208;controlled block polymer with up to 99% CO  2  conversion is furnished in this one&#8208;pot protocol. Calculations and experimental results demonstrate a chemoselective and cooperative mechanism, where the high polymerizability of OCA monomers guarantees exquisite sequence selectivity and the cooperative decarboxylation partly arose from the stabilization effect by triethylborane, facilitates the smooth transformation of the chain end from carbonate to alkoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Fluorescent Dinuclear Aluminium Complex with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high natural abundance of aluminium makes the respective fluorophores attractive for various optical applications, but photoluminescence quantum yields above 0.7 have yet not been reported for solutions of aluminium complexes. In this contribution, a dinuclear aluminium(III) complex featuring enhanced photoluminescence properties is described. Its facile one&#8208;pot synthesis originates from a readily available precursor and trimethyl aluminium. In solution, the complex exhibits an unprecedented photoluminescence

quantum yield near unity (&#934;absolute 1.0 &#177; 0.1) and an excited&#8208;state lifetime of 2.3 ns. In the solid state, J&#8208;aggregation and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching are noticed, but still quantum yields of 0.6 are observed. Embedding the complex in electrospun non&#8208;woven fabrics yields a highly fluorescent fleece possessing a quantum yield of 0.9 &#177; 0.04.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Additions of C&#8208;F Bonds to the Silanide Anion [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds exhibiting main group elements in low oxidation states were found to mimic the reactivity of transition metal complexes. Like the latter, such main group species show a proclivity of changing their oxidation state as well as their coordination number by +2, therefore fulfilling the requirements for oxidative additions. Prominent examples of such main group compounds that undergo oxidative additions with organohalides R&#8208;X (R = alkyl, aryl, X = F, Cl, Br, I) are carbenes and their higher congeners. Aluminyl anions, which like carbenes and silylenes oxidatively add to strong &#963;&#8208;bonds in R&#8208;X species, have been recently discovered. We present the first anion based upon a group 14 element, namely the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide anion, [Si(C  2  F  5  )  3  ]  &#8722;  , which is capable of oxidative additions towards C&#8208;F bonds. This enables the isolation of non&#8208;chelated tetraorganofluorosilicate salts, which to the best of our knowledge had only been observed as reactive intermediates before.</dc:description>

This enables the isolation of non-chelated tetraorganofluorosilicate salts, which to the best of our knowledge had only been observed as reactive intermediates before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Drastic Events and Gradual Change Define the Structure of an Active Copper&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Alumina Catalyst for Methanol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;zinc&#8208;alumina (CZA) catalyst is one of the most important catalysts. Nevertheless, the still limited understanding of the complex CZA structure hampers further optimization. Critical to the production of a highly active and stable catalyst are optimal start&#8208;up procedures in hydrogen. Here, by employing operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, we follow how the industrial CZA precursor evolves into the working catalyst. Two major events in the activation drastically alter the copper&#8208; and zinc&#8208;containing components in the CZA catalyst and define the final working catalyst structure: the reduction of the starting copper(II) oxide and the switch to catalytic conditions. These drastic structural changes are accompanied by the gradual structural change. Understanding what happens during these events is key to develop tailored start&#8208;up protocols that are aimed at maximal longevity and activity of the catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for Chaperone&#8208;Independent Ubiquitination of Tau Protein by its E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;site ubiquitination of Tau protein found in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease filaments hints at the failed attempt of neurons to remove early toxic species. The ubiquitin&#8208;dependent degradation of Tau is regulated in vivo by the E3 ligase CHIP, a quality controller of the cell proteome dedicated to target misfolded proteins for degradation. In our study, by using site&#8208;resolved NMR, biochemical and computational methods, we elucidate the structural determinants underlying the molecular recognition between the ligase and its intrinsically disordered substrate. We reveal a multi&#8208;domain dynamic interaction that explains how CHIP can direct ubiquitination of Tau at multiple sites even in the absence of chaperones, including its typical partner Hps70/Hsc70. Our findings thus provide mechanistic insight into the chaperone&#8208;independent engagement of a disordered protein by its E3 ligase.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolution of High Mechanical Strength Dry&#8208;Network Polythiourethane Thermosets into Neat Macroscopic Hollow Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organism&#8208;inspired hollow structure attracts increasing interest to construct various bionic functional hollow materials. Next&#8208;generation self&#8208;evolution hollow material tends to combine simple synthesis, high mechanical strength, and regular shape. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel dry&#8208;network polythiourethane thermoset with excellent mechanical performance. The polymer film could evolve into a neat and well&#8208;organized object with a macroscopic hollow interior structure after being immersed in aqueous NaOH solution. The self&#8208;evolution hollow structure originated from a hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network, which was later transformed into a network bearing both hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds. The swelling and thickness growth of this material could be controlled by the NaOH concentration and the immersion time. This unique self&#8208;evolution behavior was further utilized to produce a series of macroscopic 3D hollow&#8208;containing molds, which could be potentially applied in the production of smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polymeric Nanobeacon for Monitoring the Fluctuation of Hydrogen Polysulfides During Fertilization and Embryonic Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fertilization  and early  embryonic development  as the beginning of a new life are key biological events. Hydrogen polysulfide (  H  2  S  n  ) plays important roles during physiological regulation, such as antioxidation&#8208;protection. However, no report studied  in situ  H  2  S  n  fluctuation during early embryonic development because of the low abundance of  H  2  S  n  and inadequate sensitivity of probes. We herein construct a polymeric nanobeacon  from H  2  S  n  &#8208;responsive polymer and  fluorophores, which is capable of detecting H  2  S  n  selectively and signal amplification. Taking the zebrafish as a model, the polymeric nanobeacon revealed that H  2  S  n  level was significantly elevated after fertilization due to the activation of cell multiplication,  suppressed  partially during embryonic development, and finally keep  steady  up to  zebrafish  emergence. This strategy is generally accessible for biomarkers by altering the responsive unit on and significant for facilitating biological analysis during life development.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Solid&#8208;State Multiple Phase Changes with Tuned Photoemission in a Gold Thiolate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of an universal memory that exhibits fast access speed, high&#8208;density storage, and non&#8208;volatility has fueled research into phase&#8208;change materials over the past decades. In spite of the efficiency of the inorganic chalcogenides for Phase&#8208;Change Random Access Memory (PCRAM), they still have some inherent drawbacks, such as high temperature required for phase change and difficulty to control the domain size of the phase change, because of their brittleness. Here we present a Au(I)&#8208;thiolate coordination polymer which undergoes two successive phase changes on application of mild heating (&lt; 200 &#176;C) from amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline1&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline2 phases. These transitions are reversible upon soft hand grinding. More importantly, each phase exhibits different photoluminescent properties for an efficient optical read&#8208;out. We believe that the ability of the Au(I)&#8208;thiolate coordination polymer to have reversible phase changes under soft conditions but at the same time display district optical signals can pave the way for the next generation of PCRAM.</dc:description>

         <title>A TMEDA&#8208;Iron Adduct Reaction Manifold in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we expand the current molecular&#8208;level understanding of one of the most important and effective additives in iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions, N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). Focusing on relevant phenyl and ethyl Grignard reagents and slow nucleophile addition protocols commonly used in effective catalytic systems, TMEDA&#8208;iron(II)&#8208;aryl intermediates are identified via in situ spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and detailed reaction studies to be a part of an iron(II)/(III)/(I) reaction cycle where radical recombination FePhBr(TMEDA) (2Ph) results in selective product formation in high yield. These results differ from prior studies with mesityl Grignard reagent, where poor product selectivity and low catalytic performance can be attributed to homoleptic iron&#8208;ate species. Overall, this study represents a critical advance in how amine additives such as TMEDA can modulate selectivity and reactivity of organoiron species in cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Rewritable Macromolecular Data Storage with Automated Read&#8208;out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rewriting data stored on synthetic macromolecules is an interesting feature, even though it is considered as being quite challenging within the area of digital macromolecules. In this context, we initially studied a strategy for modifying the position tag of sequence&#8208;encoded macromolecules in a reversible manner. The efficiency of this method, which relies on the orthogonal cleavage of a thioester moiety  via  aminolysis, was demonstrated by modifying parts of an exemplary sentence. Simultaneously, a novel algorithm was developed to ease the read&#8208;out of macromolecular information by means of MS/MS techniques. This program, Oligoreader, can identify potential information&#8208;containing macromolecules from a series of MS  1  spectra, analyze the corresponding MS  2  spectra, and finally decode the data. Consequently, the algorithm simplifies the entire read&#8208;out process by avoiding any interference from the operator, which increases the potential for blind sequencing of uniform macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Asymmetric Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with EQE of 32.8% and Extremely Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters show great potentials for high color purity organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the simultaneous realization of high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel asymmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitter (2Cz&#8208;PTZ&#8208;BN) is designed that fully inherits the high PLQY and large kRISC values of the properly selected parent molecules. The resonating extended &#960;&#8208;skeleton with peripheral protection can achieve high PLQY of 96% and fast kRISC of above 1.0&#215;105 s&#8208;1, and boost the performance of corresponding pure green device with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 32.8% without utilizing any sensitizing hosts. Remarkably, the device sufficiently maintains high EQE of exceeding 23% at a high luminance of 1000 cd m&#8208;2, representing the highest value for reported green MR&#8208;TADF materials at the same luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contemporary years, the increasing demand for high&#8208;capacity and safe energy storage has spurred wide attentions in zinc batteries featuring either high voltage, high capacity or both. Despite the extensive research progress, achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries is still challenging and requires a synergy of the multiple factors including reaction mechanisms, electrodes, and electrolytes. In this Review, we comprehensively summarize the rational design strategies, and critically analyze the positive effects and potential issues in optimizing the electrochemistry, cathode materials, electrolytes and device architecture. At the end, the challenges and prospects for the further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc batteries are outlined to guide the research towards new&#8208;generation batteries for household appliance, low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage system.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Lock Label Based on Thermosensitive Polymer Hydrogels for Information Camouflage and Multi&#8208;level Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing extra safety encryption technologies to prevent information leakage and combat fakes is highly demanded but challenging. Herein, we propose a &#8220;double lock&#8221; strategy based on both lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) polymer hydrogels for information camouflage and multilevel encryption. Two types of hydrogels were synthesized by the method of random copolymerization. The number of &#8208;CO&#8208;NH2 groups in the network structure of the hydrogels changed the enthalpic or entropic of thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels, and ultimately precisely controlled their phase transition temperature. The crosslink density of the polymer hydrogels governs the diffusion kinetics, resulting in difference in the time for their color change. The combination of multiple LCST and UCST hydrogels in one label realized information encryption and dynamic information identification in the dimensions of both time and temperature. This work is of high inspiration for the fields of information encryption, anticounterfeiting, and smart responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Single Atom Coating Strategy Based on Tannic Acid Chemistry for Multifunctional Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a universal single atom coating (SAC) strategy by taking advantage of rich chemistry of tannic acid (TA). TA units not only self&#8208;assemble into a cross&#8208;linked porous polyphenolic framework, but also can grip on different substates via multiple binding modes. Benefiting from the diverse chelating ability of TA, a series of mono&#8208;, and bi&#8208;metallic SACs can be formed on substrates of different materials (e.g., carbon, SiO  2  , TiO  2  , MoS  2  ), dimensions (0D &#8211; 3D) and sizes (50 nm &#8211; 5 cm). By contrast, uniform SAC cannot be achieved using common approaches such as pyrolysis of metal&#8208;dopamine complex or metal organic frameworks. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, two Co SACs immobilized on the graphene and TiO  2  were prepared. The previous one shows six&#8208;fold higher mass activity than Pt/C toward oxygen reduction. The latter one displays outstanding photocatalytic activity owning to the high activity of single atoms and the formation of SAC coating&#8208;TiO  2  heterojunction.</dc:description>

Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH3Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60% over HZSM&#8208;5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10&#8208;membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one&#160;(DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins. Furthermore, isotopic labeling analysis confirms that CO is inserted into the DMCPO and aromatics rings. A new aromatization mechanism is proposed, including the formation of the above intermediates, which conspicuously weakens the hydrogen transfer reaction, leading to a considerable increase of aromatics selectivity and a dramatic drop of alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing the Development of Recyclable Aromatic Polyesters by Functionalization and Stereocomplexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of innovative synthetic polymer systems to overcome the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer&#8217;s depolymerizability and performance properties is highly demanded for advanced material applications and sustainable development. In this contribution, we prepared a class of aromatic cyclic esters (  M1  &#8208;  M5  ) from thiosalicylic acid and epoxides by facile one&#8208;pot synthesis. Ring&#8208;opening polymerization of  M  s afforded aromatic polyesters P(  M  )s with high molecular weights and narrow dispersities. The physical and mechanical properties of P(  M  )s can be modulated by stereocomplexation and regulation of the side&#8208;chain flexibility of the polymers, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance properties such as high thermal stability and crystallinity (  T  m  up to 209 &#176;C), as well as polyolefin&#8208;like high mechanical strength, ductility, and toughness. Furthermore, the functionalizable moieties of P(  M  )s have driven a wide array of post&#8208;polymerization modifications toward access to value&#8208;added materials. More importantly, the P(  M  )s were able to selectively depolymerize into monomers in excellent yields, thus establishing its circular life cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair in Zeolite Cages for Alkane Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) concept in homogenous catalysis was extended to the heterogeneous catalysis  via  &#160;the supramolecular&#160;system of FLP between deprotonated zeolite&#160;framework oxygens&#160;and confined carbocations in methanol to olefin&#160;(MTO) reactions.&#160;In this FLP, the polymethylbenzenium&#160;(PMB  +  ) was Lewis acid to accept electron pair, and the deprotonated framework oxygen&#160;site&#160;was the Lewis base to donate electron pair. This FLP was theoretically demonstrated&#160;the ability to H  2  heterolysis and&#160;alkanes dehydrogenation, and&#160;further confirmed by the&#160;gas chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometer&#160;(GC&#8208;MS) catalytic experiments inside&#160;FLP&#8208;containing&#160;chabazite zeolites. All these findings would not only bring out new recognition to the carbocation chemistry in zeolite cage but also put forward the new reaction pathway as one part of MTO reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed ON&#8208;OFF Switchable Hydrogenation Using a Molecular Shuttle based on a [2]Rotaxane with a Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel pH&#8208;responsive molecular shuttle based on a [2]rotaxane with a phosphine ligand,  [2]Rotaxane&#8208;H&#8208;Phos  , was designed and synthesized. In the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroamino acid esters and aryl enamides, ON&#8208;OFF switchable catalysis was accomplished in high ON&#8208;OFF ratios upon acid/base&#8208;adjusting the movements of the rotaxane wheels located at the catalyst terminals. Mechanistic studies by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and quasi  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that Rh(III)&#8208;hydride species were possibly formed under H  2  atmosphere in the catalyst OFF&#8208;state. In this process, a heterolytic activation of dihydrogen occurred by the interlocked rotaxane dibenzylamine and Rh(I) catalytic center, acting as a frustrated Lewis pair. Subsequent homolytic splitting of dihydrogen with the newly formed Rh(I)&#8208;H species generated Rh(III)&#8208;hydride species. On the basis of these findings, a substrate selective hydrogenation was achieved by using the OFF&#8208;state catalyst.</dc:description>

Dibranched Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The palladium&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes is described for the first time. Aromatic terminal alkynes bearing diverse and sensitive functional groups as well as aliphatic terminal alkynes are efficiently transformed to 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes. The key to achieve selective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is to control appropriately the acidity of the reaction solution, which is accomplished by a combined use of pivalic acid and  para  &#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate under acidic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Soft&#8208;Solid Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for H2/CO2&#160;Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a facile strategy to construct defect&#8208;free and flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membrane with high selectivity and good scalability holds great appeal. Here we report the fabrication of soft&#8208;solid MOF composite membranes on polyvinylidene fluoride substrates. A representative membrane comprised of quasi&#8208;vertically grown lamellar Zn  2  (Bim)  4  (Bim = benzimidazolate) and lateral ultrathin polyamide film adhering to the MOF side facets. The straight interlayer galleries within unwrapped Zn  2  (Bim)  4  &#160;acted as predominant pathways, while polyamide served the function of defect elimination, synergistically inducing an unprecedented H  2  /CO  2  &#160;selectivity as high as 1084. Separation performance was held constant after membrane rolling up into a tube with a diameter of 3 mm or folding and unfolding at 90&#176; for 50 times. ZIF&#8208;67 and ZIF&#8208;8 composite membranes based on this strategy also realized extremely high H  2  /CO  2  &#160;separation accuracies. These results which may demonstrate the intrinsic molecular sieving capability of MOFs will promote the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes in practical separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dipole&#8208;Induced Photoredox Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution over Self&#8208;Assembled Naphthalimide Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D was smartly designed and synthesized to fabricate self&#8208;assembled CZNI nanoribbons for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. It was revealed that the molecular dipole field could significantly reduce the exciton binding energy of the organic semiconductor and drive exciton dissociation to free charges for reducing protons to H2.

D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type 4&#8208;((9&#8208;phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)ethynyl)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (CZNI) with a large dipole moment of 8.49&#8197;D and A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type bis[(4,4&#8242;&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide)&#8208;N&#8208;dodecyl]ethyne (NINI) with a negligible dipole moment of 0.28&#8197;D, were smartly designed and synthesized to demonstrate the evidence of a molecular dipole as the dominant mechanism for controlling charge separation of organic semiconductors. In aqueous solution, these two novel naphthalimides can self&#8208;assemble to form nanoribbons (NRs) that present significantly different traces of exciton dissociation dynamics. Upon photoexcitation of NINI&#8208;NRs, no charge&#8208;separated excitons (CSEs) are formed due to the large exciton binding energy, accordingly there is no hydrogen evolution. On the contrary, in the photoexcited CZNI&#8208;NRs, the initial bound Frenkel excitons are dissociated to long&#8208;lived CSEs after undergoing ultrafast charge transfer within ca. 1.25&#8197;ps and charge separation within less than 5.0&#8197;ps. Finally, these free electrons were injected into Pt co&#8208;catalysts for reducing protons to H2 at a rate of ca. 417&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, correspondingly an apparent quantum efficiency of ca. 1.3&#8201;% can be achieved at 400&#8197;nm.

         <title>Dendritic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Structure, Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) with radial pores is provided. Perspectives into their formation mechanisms, synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships and future research directions with a focus on biomedical applications are presented.







Abstract
Recently, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles with widespread applications have attracted great interest. Despite many publications (&gt;800), the terminology &#8220;dendritic&#8221; is ambiguous. Understanding what possible &#8220;dendritic structures&#8221; are, their formation mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationship is fundamentally important. With the advance of characterization techniques such as electron tomography, two types of tree&#8208;branch&#8208;like and flower&#8208;like structures can be distinguished, both described as &#8220;dendritic&#8221; in the literature. In this Review, we start with the definition of &#8220;dendritic&#8221;, then provide critical analysis of reported dendritic silica nanoparticles according to their structural classification. We update the understandings of the formation mechanisms of two types of &#8220;dendritic&#8221; nanoparticles, highlighting how to control their structural parameters. Applications of dendritic mesoporous nanoparticles are also reviewed with a focus on the biomedical field, providing new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship in this family of nanomaterials.

         <title>Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Epoxidation via a Catalytically Formed Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic asymmetric installation of a chiral auxiliary gives access to enantioenriched oxazolidines bearing a tetra&#8208;substituted olefin from readily available propargylic amines. In this work, we extend the use of the catalytically formed chiral auxiliary, previously limited to hydrogenation, to asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation using simple and robust reaction conditions for accessing highly substituted products.







Abstract
For the enantioselective diversification of a single starting material, a different chiral catalyst is usually required for each transformation. Herein, we extend the concept of catalytically formed chiral auxiliary from hydrogenation to the asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation of tetra&#8208;substituted olefins, alleviating the need for different chiral catalysts in the alkene functionalization step. The chiral auxiliary is catalytically constructed from propargylic amines in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective carboetherification step using a commercially available trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal tether. The installed auxiliary is then controlling the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanation and the epoxidation using standard highly reactive reagents to give enantioenriched spirocyclic aminomethylcyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.

         <title>Highly Efficient Polarizing Agents for MAS&#8208;DNP of Proton&#8208;Dense Molecular Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarizing agent is introduced to efficiently polarize proton&#8208;dense solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) ssNMR. This work shows that this new biradical can be used on organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies at high field and fast magic angle spinning (MAS). It notably unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.







Abstract
Efficiently hyperpolarizing proton&#8208;dense molecular solids through dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR is still an unmet challenge. Polarizing agents (PAs) developed so far do not perform well on proton&#8208;rich systems, such as organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies. Herein we introduce a new PA, cAsymPol&#8208;POK, and report outstanding hyperpolarization efficiency on 12.76&#8197;kDa U&#8208;13C,15N&#8208;labeled LecA protein and pharmaceutical drugs at high magnetic fields (up to 18.8&#8197;T) and fast magic angle spinning (MAS) frequencies (up to 40&#8197;kHz). The performance of cAsymPol&#8208;POK is rationalized by MAS&#8208;DNP simulations combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of 13C&#8211;13C and 15N&#8211;13C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Chemodivergent Allenylic Alkylation of Vinyl Azides for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Allenylic Amides and Ketones**

         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective allenylic alkylation of unstabilized enolates is enabled by cooperative iridium and Lewis acid catalysis using vinyl azide as an amide and ketone enolate surrogate. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, these desiccant&#8208;controlled chemodivergent fragment&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and deliver &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.







Abstract
The first enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones through allenylic alkylation of vinyl azides is reported. In these chemodivergent reactions, cooperatively catalyzed by a IrI/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Sc(OTf)3, vinyl azides act as the surrogate for both amide enolates and ketone enolates. The desiccant (molecular sieves) plays a crucial role in controlling the chemodivergency of this enantioconvergent and regioselective reaction: Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of the desiccant led to &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides, while its absence resulted in &#945;&#8208;allenylic ketones. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, the overall process represents a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT), where both the products are formed with the same absolute configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of vinyl azide as the ketone enolate surrogate in an enantioselective transformation.

         <title>Inhibition of ACE2&#8208;Spike Interaction by an ACE2 Binder Suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Entry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein could be limited in inhibiting viral entry via the RBD&#8211;ACE2 interaction due to the emerging spike mutations. Instead, targeting ACE2 with a small molecule could suppress the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into the host cells, without impairing the enzymatic activity of ACE2, which is necessary for the physiological function of the host cells.







Abstract
The emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants is a significant concern in developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in the middle of the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we have identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Transient Plasmonic Imaging of Ion Migration on Single Nanoparticles and Insight for Double Layer Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration on single nanoparticles was directly measured by using a transient microscopy method. Under nanoscale and transient conditions, the electric double layer (EDL) dynamics can deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance model. A new model was proposed to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;nanoparticle electrochemistry offers electrochemical behaviors of individual entities beyond the ensemble system. An electric double layer (EDL) exists on any charged particle&#8211;liquid interface because of counter&#8208;ion accumulation, while direct measuring of the interfacial ion migration remains a challenge. Herein, a plasmonic&#8208;based transient microscopic method, with a temporal resolution of 1&#8211;2&#8197;&#956;s, was demonstrated to directly track the ion migration dynamics on single charged nanoparticles. We found that the dynamics of EDL formation might deviate significantly from the prediction made by using the classical resistance&#8211;capacitance (RC) model under nanoscale and transient conditions. Under ultrafast charging, due to the limit migration rate of ions in the solution, the actual time scale of the EDL formation could be up to 5&#8197;times slower than the predicted value from the RC model. We then proposed a new theoretical model to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation. These results may expand our current knowledge about nano&#8208;electrochemistry and transient electrochemistry.

         <title>WSe2 Flakelets on N&#8208;Doped Graphene for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets decorated on the N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with an abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and significantly alleviate the shuttling effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is still limited by the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling effect on the S cathode and uncontrollable Li&#8208;dendrite growth on the Li anode. Herein, elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets immobilized on N&#8208;doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with abundant active sites are employed to be a dual&#8208;functional host for satisfying both the S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe2/NG with a strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode, the WSe2/NG with excellent lithiophilic features can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite. Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li&#8722;S full batteries exhibit remarkable rate performance and stable cycling stability even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1.

A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade cyclization/[1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement is disclosed, affording valuable chiral chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrroles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to good yields with excellent enantioselectivities.

Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade cyclization/[1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement via a non&#8208;diazo approach, leading to the practical and atom&#8208;economic assembly of various valuable chiral chromeno[3,4&#8208;c]pyrroles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to good yields with wide substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first example of catalytic asymmetric [1,2]&#8208;Stevens&#8208;type rearrangement based on alkynes but also constitutes the first asymmetric formal carbene insertion into the Si&#8722;O bond.

Half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aldimines and alkenes with broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208;, diastereoselectivity and 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;efficiency.







Abstract
Here we report for the first time the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective [3+2] annulation of a wide range of aliphatic aldimines with alkenes via the activation of an unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond by half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalysts. This protocol offers a straightforward and atom&#8208;efficient route for the synthesis of a new family of multi&#8208;substituted aminocyclopentane derivatives from easily accessible aliphatic aldimines and alkenes. The annulation of aldimines with styrenes exclusively afforded the 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity through the 2,1&#8208;insertion of a styrene unit. The annulation of aldimines with aliphatic alkenes selectively gave the 4&#8208;alkyl&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;aminocyclopentane products in a 1,2&#8208;insertion fashion. A catalytic amount of an appropriate amine such as adamantylamine (AdNH2) or dibenzylamine (Bn2NH) showed significant effects on the catalyst activity and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Manipulation of Multiple Cell&#8211;Cell Interactions by Tunable DNA Scaffold Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and effective living cell encapsulation strategy is developed for reversible manipulation of cell&#8211;cell interactions. The controllable cell&#8211;cell interactions and molecular transportation between cells was achieved by fabricating functional DNA scaffold networks on cell surface. This DNA scaffold network&#8208;based strategy holds great potential in cell surface engineering, synthetic biology, and cell&#8208;based biomedicine.







Abstract
Manipulation of cell&#8211;cell interactions via cell surface engineering has potential biomedical applications in tissue engineering and cell therapy. However, manipulation of the comprehensive and multiple intercellular interactions remains a challenge and missing elements. Herein, utilizing a DNA triangular prism (TP) and a branched polymer (BP) as functional modules, we fabricate tunable DNA scaffold networks on the cell surface. The responsiveness of cell&#8211;cell recognition, aggregation and dissociation could be modulated by aptamer&#8208;functionalized DNA scaffold networks with high accuracy and specificity. By regulating the DNA scaffold networks coated on the cell surface, controlled intercellular molecular transportation is achieved. Our tunable network provides a simple and extendible strategy which addresses a current need in cell surface engineering to precisely manipulate cell&#8211;cell interactions and shows promise as a general tool for controllable cell behavior.

         <title>Preparing Two&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Li0.33La0.557TiO3 Crystal in Interlayer Channel of Thin Laminar Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte towards Ultrafast Li+ Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D LLTO crystal with large&#8208;size, oriented, and crystal defect&#8208;free structure was obtained by controlling the LLTO crystal growth and arrangement in the confined space of 2D laminar channels, which achieved faster Li+ transfer than LLTO Pellet.







Abstract
Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with &#8776;1.3&#8197;nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li+ transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and conductance of 87.2&#8197;mS at 30&#8201;&#176;C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24&#8197;GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery.

         <title>Indomethacin Polymorph &#948; Revealed To Be Two Plastically Bendable Crystal Forms by 3D Electron Diffraction: Correcting a 47&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Misunderstanding**

         <dc:description>
The structures of the third polymorph of indomethacin, Form &#948;, crystallized from both melt and solution are reported. The two crystallization methods were believed to produce the same polymorph since its discovery in 1974. Through combining microdroplet melt crystallization with 3D electron diffraction, we reveal that the two crystallization methods produce two different polymorphs and correct this 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding.







Abstract
Indomethacin is a clinically classical non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;&#8208;indomethacin cannot be cultivated as large single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;&#8208;indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt&#8208;crystallized and solution&#8208;crystallized &#948;&#8208;indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs. This discovery and correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that 3D electron diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;to&#8208;adsorbent&#8208;based sorting of fine particles, including cells, is engineered by minimizing the masking effect of non&#8208;specific interactions. Due to a high contact area and hence high detachment energy, even non&#8208;specifically and weakly interacting particulates are quasi&#8208;irreversibly bound to adsorbents. Microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic interfaces provide a solution for sorting highly asymmetric cell and particle mixtures.







Abstract
The mechanism of separation methods, for example, liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions kT, required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few kT for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.

&lt;p&gt;Affinity-to-adsorbent-based sorting of fine particles, including cells, is engineered by minimizing the masking effect of non-specific interactions. Due to a high contact area and hence high detachment energy, even non-specifically and weakly interacting particulates are quasi-irreversibly bound to adsorbents. Microstructured stimuli-responsive dynamic interfaces provide a solution for sorting highly asymmetric cell and particle mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of separation methods, for example, liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption-desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions kT, required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few kT for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi-irreversible. The dynamic adsorption-desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli-responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical-force-facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle-polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial-scale label-free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transformation Pathways in Colloidal CdTeSe Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ternary magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC), CdTeSe MSC&#8208;422 evolved at room temperature while CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 decreased in a mixture of toluene (Tol) and octylamine (OTA). The transformation goes through corresponding precursor compounds (PCs), with step&#8197;1 transforming PC&#8208;399 to PC&#8208;422, which is rate&#8208;determining and features first&#8208;order reaction kinetics.







Abstract
A rarely studied transformation in colloidal ternary magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) is addressed. We report the first observation of the transformation from ternary CdTeSe MSC&#8208;399 to MSC&#8208;422, which occurs at room temperature. These two MSC types display sharp optical absorption resonances at 399 and 422&#8197;nm, respectively, and are related in that they are quasi isomers, together with their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs). Binary CdTe and CdSe samples were prepared in the prenucleation stage also called the induction period (IP). After they were mixed and placed in a mixture of toluene and octylamine, the transformation was found to take place and to be assisted by the addition of the CdSe IP sample. A binary IP sample contains corresponding binary PCs and monomers (Mo) and fragments (Fr). We argue that the transformation pathway is enabled by the corresponding ternary PCs, involving the substitution reaction, namely CdTeSe PC&#8208;399 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;1 &#8658; CdTeSe PC&#8208;422 + CdSe (Mo/Fr)&#8208;2. The present study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the formation characteristics of the MSCs.

         <title>Surface Gelation on Disulfide Electrocatalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries is identified for the first time. The gel layer, formed through the solvent polymerization triggered by the Lewis acid sites, covers the active electrocatalytic sites and renders reduced redox kinetics. Herein, a Lewis base triethylamine is introduced to suppress the surface gelation and promote the electrocatalytic activity of disulfide electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are deemed as future energy storage devices due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. Cathodic polysulfide electrocatalysts have been widely investigated to promote sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Probing the surface structure of electrocatalysts is vital to understanding the mechanism of polysulfide electrocatalysis. In this work, we for the first time identify surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts. Concretely, the Lewis acid sites on disulfides trigger the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the dioxolane solvent to generate a surface gel layer, covering disulfides and reducing the electrocatalytic activity. Accordingly, a Lewis base triethylamine (TEA) is introduced as a competitive inhibitor. Consequently, Li&#8211;S batteries with disulfide electrocatalysts and TEA afford high specific capacity and improved rate responses. This work affords new insights on the actual surface structure of electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>The Crystal Plane is not the Key Factor for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methane Electrosynthesis on Reconstructed Cu2O Microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;depth mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on in&#8197;situ reconstructed Cu2O microparticles is still ambiguous. Now strong evidence shows that the Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane production rather than the initial crystal planes of the Cu2O microparticles.







Abstract
Cu2O microparticles with controllable crystal planes and relatively high stability have been recognized as a good platform to understand the mechanism of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we demonstrate that the in&#8197;situ generated Cu2O/Cu interface plays a key role in determining the selectivity of methane formation, rather than the initial crystal plane of the reconstructed Cu2O microparticles. Experimental results indicate that the methane evolution is dominated on all three different crystal planes with similar Tafel slopes and long&#8208;term stabilities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that *CO is protonated via a similar bridge configuration at the Cu2O/Cu interface, regardless of the initial crystal planes of Cu2O. The Gibbs free energy changes (&#916;G) of *CHO on different reconstructed Cu2O planes are close and more negative than that of *OCCOH, indicating the methane formation is more favorable than ethylene on all Cu2O crystal planes.

Recognizing monogenic RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) in vivo is challenging. We developed a module&#8208;assembled multifunctional probes assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid secondary structure, regulate many biological functions and are considered potential molecular targets for cancer therapeutics. However, due to the lack of analytical methods, the regulating mechanism of monogenic G4s is still unclear. Here, we developed a Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells. Two modular probes separately recognize G4 structures and the adjacent RNA sequences, and the module assembly enables imaging of G4s in an individual RNA with high specificity. Through imaging G4s in several individual genes, we found that G4s were steadily occupied by G4 Binding Proteins (G4BPs) in various mRNAs in every cell line and defined &#8220;Occupied G4 Ratio&#8221;. We demonstrated MAMPA was suitable for most experimental situations and found that Occupied G4 Ratios had the potential to become a new parameter for the study of G4s in living cells.

Three new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, P&#8208;0, P&#8208;50, and P&#8208;75 are developed, in which the lactone group densities were maximized by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75), to enable co&#8208;planar polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of P&#8208;75 exhibits a good thermoelectric performance with a maximum electrical conductivity of 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8208;1 and figure of merit power factor of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8208;1&#8197;K&#8208;2.







Abstract
Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37&#8197;eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Rational Design of Axially Chiral Styrene&#8208;Based Organocatalysts and Their Application in Catalytic Asymmetric (2+4) Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts has been rationally designed. They enable the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines. This work represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, and it gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.







Abstract
A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based thiourea tertiary amine catalysts, which have unique characteristics such as an efficient synthetic route, multiple chiral elements, and multiple activating groups, has been rationally designed. These new chiral catalysts have proven to be efficient organocatalysts, enabling the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with homophthalic anhydrides in good yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with excellent stereoselectivities (all &gt;95:5 dr, up to 98&#8201;% ee). More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the important role of an axially chiral styrene moiety in controlling both the reactivity and enantioselectivity. This work not only represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, but also gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.

         <title>Unexpected Role of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Family Protein in Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family protein, MrqM, was revealed as a cyclase in the biosynthesis of murayaquinone by the in vivo genetic experiment, which is a new strategy used in type II polyketide cyclization. This finding not only broadens the functions of the short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins, but also paves the way for future work in polyketide cyclization and engineering.







Abstract
We investigated the biosynthetic pathway of type II polyketide murayaquinone. The murayaquinone biosynthetic cluster contains genes for three putative short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes including MrqF and MrqH with known functions and MrqM with unclear function. We report the functional characterization of MrqM for its role in murayaquinone biosynthesis. Our gene deletion experiment and structural elucidation of the accumulated intermediates revealed that MrqM is related with the second polyketide ring cyclization, because the inactivation of mrqM resulted in the accumulation of an off&#8208;pathway intermediate SEK43 and disrupted the second and third ring cyclization. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies showed that two conserved residues in MrqM and homologous proteins Y151 and K155 are essential for its activity. The previously proposed second/third ring cyclase, MrqD, might instead play another important role in the chain releasing step of the murayaquinone biosynthesis.

Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds on the surface of graphdiyne successfully verifies the self&#8208;expanded Li&#8208;ion transport channels, self&#8208;accelerated Li in&#8208;plane/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration, and superior fast&#8208;charging capability with a high capacity (342&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan (22&#8201;000 cycles) under extremely fast&#8208;charging conditions (6&#8201;C rate, 1&#8201;C=744&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), even at low temperatures (&#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Transformation of Crowded Oligoarylene into Perylene&#8208;Cored Chiral Nanographene by Sequential Oxidative Cyclization and 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene processively transforms into &#960;&#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with two helical breaches under Scholl's conditions. The acquisition of various intermediates implies a distinctive reaction pathway mainly involving the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the peri&#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration.







Abstract
Synthetic innovation for constructing sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare &#960;&#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl's conditions, the reaction predominantly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the peri&#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurationally stable at 180&#8201;&#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

     alt="Transformation of Crowded Oligoarylene into Perylene-Cored Chiral Nanographene by Sequential Oxidative Cyclization and 1,2-Phenyl Migration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly crowded perylene-cored oligoarylene processively transforms into &#960;-extended chiral nanographenes with two helical breaches under Scholl's conditions. The acquisition of various intermediates implies a distinctive reaction pathway mainly involving the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;- and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1-phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2-phenyl migration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic innovation for constructing sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare &#960;-extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene-cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl's conditions, the reaction predominantly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;- and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1-phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2-phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurationally stable at 180&#8201;&#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These molecules also possess globally delocalized &#960;-systems with low HOMO/LUMO gaps, leading to nearly panchromatic absorption, intensive electronic circular dichroism signals and deep-red circularly polarized luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Sulfur&#8208;Rich Thermoplastic Elastomers Enabled by Metal&#8208;Free Self&#8208;Switchable Catalysis and Air&#8208;Assisted Coupling</title>

Episulfide&#8208;involved self&#8208;switchable polymerization to produce well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich triblock thermoplastic elastomers has been achieved via an ammonium salt mediated copolymerization of episulfide/isothiocyanate together with an air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy.







Abstract
Construction of well&#8208;defined sulfur&#8208;rich macromolecules in a facile manner is an interesting but challenging topic. Herein, we disclose how to readily construct well&#8208;defined triblock sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers via a self&#8208;switchable isothiocyanate/episulfide copolymerization and air&#8208;assisted oxidative coupling strategy. During self&#8208;switchable polymerization, alternating copolymerization of isothiocyanate and episulfide occurs initially due to the lower energy barrier for isothiocyanate insertion with respect to successive episulfide ring&#8208;opening. After exhaustion of isothiocyanate, ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfide begins, providing diblock polymers. Subsequent exposure of the reaction to air leads to a transformation of diblock copolymers into triblock thermoplastic elastomers. This protocol can be extended to diverse isothiocyanates and episulfides, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of the performance of the produced sulfur&#8208;rich thermoplastic elastomers.

         <title>A Carbene Strategy for Progressive (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroalkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of fluoroalkyl ketones is reported. This method allowed for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoroalkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Hydrodefluorination is one of the most promising chemical strategies to degrade perfluorochemicals into partially fluorinated compounds. However, controlled progressive hydrodefluorination remains a significant challenge, owing to the decrease in the strength of C&#8722;F bonds along with the defluorination. Here we describe a carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl ketones under rhodium catalysis, allowing for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and even alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoro&#8208;alkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The reaction mechanism and the origin of the intriguing chemoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of Poly(silylether)s: Access to Degradable Polymers from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of renewable polymers has been synthesized from easily accessible biobased hydroxyaldehydes and dihydrosilanes. Using low catalyst loadings of platinum complexes, different polymer architectures were obtained, from random to alternated copolymers. The intrinsic chemical recyclability of these poly(silylether)s is also highlighted.







Abstract
The design of new materials with tunable properties and intrinsic recyclability, derived from biomass under mild conditions, stands as a gold standard in polymer chemistry. Reported herein are platinum complexes which catalyze the formation of poly(silylether)s (PSEs) at low catalyst loadings. These polymers are directly obtained from dual&#8208;functional biobased building blocks such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or vanillin, coupled with various dihydrosilanes. Access to different types of copolymer architectures (statistical or alternating) is highlighted by several synthetic strategies. The materials obtained were then characterized as low Tg materials (ranging from &#8722;60 to 29&#8201;&#176;C), stable upon heating (T&#8722;5% up to 301&#8201;&#176;C) and resistant towards uncatalyzed methanolysis. Additionally, quantitative chemical recycling of several PSEs could be triggered by acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis or methanolysis. These results emphasize the interest of biobased poly(silylether)s as sustainable materials with high recycling potential.

         <title>A Universal Boronate&#8208;Affinity Crosslinking&#8208;Amplified Dynamic Light Scattering Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Glycoprotein Detection</title>

Herein, we report a universal boronate&#8208;affinity crosslinking&#8208;amplified dynamic light scattering immunosensing strategy and demonstrate its potential for the rapid and sensitive field detection of glycoproteins in complex samples.







Abstract
Herein, we report a universal boronate&#8208;affinity crosslinking&#8208;amplified dynamic light scattering (DLS) immunoassay for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) glycoprotein detection in complex samples. This enhanced DLS immunoassay consists of two elements, i.e., antibody&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNP@mAb) for target capture and DLS signal transduction, and phenylboronic acid&#8208;based boronate&#8208;affinity materials as crosslinking amplifiers. Upon the addition of targets, glycoproteins are first captured by MNP@mAb and amplified by target&#8208;induced crosslinking stemming from the selective binding between the boronic acid ligand and cis&#8208;diol&#8208;containing glycoprotein, thereby resulting in a remarkably increased DLS signal in the average nanoparticle size. Benefiting from the multivalent binding and fast boronate&#8208;affinity reaction between glycoproteins and crosslinkers, the proposed immunosensing strategy has achieved the ultrasensitive and rapid quantitative assay of glycoproteins at the fM level within 15&#8197;min. Overall, this work provides a promising and versatile design strategy for extending the DLS technique to detect glycoproteins even in the field or at POC.

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) membranes with high conductivity (147&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent mechanical (26&#8201;% swelling ratio) and chemical stability have been prepared. Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) using these membranes exhibit high peak power density (2.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durability (500&#8197;h).







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising, next&#8208;generation fuel cell technology. AEMFCs require highly conductive and robust anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), which are challenging to develop due to the tradeoff between conductivity and water uptake. Here we report a method to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs. We show that branching reduces water uptake, leading to improved dimensional stability. The optimized membrane, b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5, exhibits simultaneously high OH&#8722; conductivity (&gt;145&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C), high mechanical strength and dimensional stability, good processability, and excellent alkaline stability (&gt;1500&#8197;h) in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C. AEMFCs based on b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 reached peak power densities of 2.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8722;O2 and 1.3&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;air at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The AEMFCs can run stably under a constant current of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 500&#8197;h, during which the b&#8208;PTP&#8208;2.5 membrane remains stable.

&lt;p&gt;High-molecular-weight branched poly(aryl piperidinium) membranes with high conductivity (147&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and excellent mechanical (26&#8201;% swelling ratio) and chemical stability have been prepared.

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly Curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave&#8211;convex interactions between negatively and positively curved molecular nanographene with C60 allow the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms solvent dependent electron transfer after photo&#8208;excitation.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular complexes between C60 and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by 1H&#8197;NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale showed that the addition of C60 to NG&#8208;1 solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460&#8197;nm leads to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of the one&#8208;electron reduced form of C60 in benzonitrile was observed.

         <title>An Activatable Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanocomposite as Early Evaluation System of Therapy Effect</title>

In&#8197;vivo &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; NIR&#8208;II FL and NIR&#8208;II PA signals by using activated caspases&#8208;3 after radiotherapy to proteolytically cleave the peptide sequence of an AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048 nanoprobe, in addition to integrating living imaging information with a radiotherapy effect using the caspase&#8208;3 enzyme as &#8220;matchmaker&#8221; and developing the relationship between each other, enable real&#8208;time evaluation and early prediction of radiotherapy effects.







Abstract
Delays in evaluating cancer response to radiotherapy (RT) usually reduce therapy effect or miss the right time for treatment optimization. Hence, exploring timely and accurate methods enabling one to gain insights of RT response are highly desirable. In this study, we have developed an apoptosis enzyme (caspase&#8208;3) activated nanoprobe for early evaluation of RT efficacy. The nanoprobe bridged the nanogapped gold nanoparticles (AuNNPs) and the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) molecules (IR&#8208;1048) through a caspase&#8208;3 specific peptide sequence (DEVD) (AuNNP@DEVD&#8208;IR1048). After X&#8208;ray irradiation, caspase&#8208;3 was activated to cut DEVD, turning on both NIR&#8208;II FL and PA imaging signals. The increased NIR&#8208;II FL/PA signals exhibited a positive correlation with the content of caspase&#8208;3. Moreover, the amount of the activated caspase&#8208;3 was negatively correlated with the tumor size. The results underscore the role of the caspase&#8208;3 activated by X&#8208;ray irradiation in bridging the imaging signals variation and tumor inhibition rate. Overall, activatable NIR&#8208;II FL/PA imaging was successfully used to timely predict and evaluate the RT efficacy. The evaluation system based on biomarker&#8208;triggered living imaging has the capacity to guide treatment decisions for numerous cancer types.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Regulation of Defect Sites and Vertical Conduction by Spiral Domain for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we proposed a structural model of a spiral MoTe2 domain to optimize collectively active site and vertical conduction. A single spiral MoTe2&#8208;based electrocatalytic microdevice was fabricated to extract HER activity and displayed exceptional activity with an ultrahigh current density of 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 0.4&#8197;V.







Abstract
Insufficient active sites and weak vertical conduction are the intrinsic factors that restrict the electrocatalytic HER for transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. As a prototype, we proposed a model of spiral MoTe2 to optimize collectively the above issues. The conductive atomic force microscopy of an individual spiral reveals that the retentive vertical conduction irrespective of layer thickness benefits from the connected screw dislocation lines between interlayers. Theoretical calculations uncover that the regions near the edge step of the spiral structures more easily form Te vacancies and have lower &#916;GH* as extra active sites. A single spiral MoTe2&#8208;based on&#8208;chip microcell was fabricated to extract HER activity and achieved an ultrahigh current density of 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 0.4&#8197;V, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the exfoliated counterpart. Profoundly, this unusual spiral model will initiate a new pathway for triggering other inert catalytic reactions.

         <title>Remote Amino Acid Recognition Enables Effective Hydrogen Peroxide Activation at a Manganese Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>

Amino acid supramolecular recognition in the 2nd coordination sphere of a bioinspired manganese catalyst allows efficient enzyme&#8208;like activation of H2O2 by locating the carboxylic acid moiety in proper position to access the 1st coordination sphere of the metal.







Abstract
Precise delivery of a proton plays a key role in O2 activation at iron oxygenases, enabling the crucial O&#8722;O cleavage step that generates the oxidizing high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species. Such a proton is delivered by acidic residues that may either directly bind the iron center or lie in its second coordination sphere. Herein, a supramolecular strategy for enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 activation at a biologically inspired manganese catalyst, with a nearly stoichiometric amount (1&#8211;1.5&#8197;equiv) of a carboxylic acid is disclosed. Key for this strategy is the incorporation of an &#945;,&#969;&#8208;amino acid in the second coordination sphere of a chiral catalyst via remote ammonium&#8208;crown ether recognition. The properly positioned carboxylic acid function enables effective activation of hydrogen peroxide, leading to catalytic asymmetric epoxidation. Modulation of both amino acid and catalyst structure can tune the efficiency and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, and a study on the oxidative degradation pathway of the system is presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise delivery of a proton plays a key role in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation at iron oxygenases, enabling the crucial O&#8722;O cleavage step that generates the oxidizing high-valent metal&#8211;oxo species. Such a proton is delivered by acidic residues that may either directly bind the iron center or lie in its second coordination sphere. Herein, a supramolecular strategy for enzyme-like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation at a biologically inspired manganese catalyst, with a nearly stoichiometric amount (1&#8211;1.5&#8197;equiv) of a carboxylic acid is disclosed. Key for this strategy is the incorporation of an &#945;,&#969;-amino acid in the second coordination sphere of a chiral catalyst via remote ammonium-crown ether recognition. The properly positioned carboxylic acid function enables effective activation of hydrogen peroxide, leading to catalytic asymmetric epoxidation. Modulation of both amino acid and catalyst structure can tune the efficiency and the enantioselectivity of the reaction, and a study on the oxidative degradation pathway of the system is presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Covalent Headpiece Enables Interconversion between Double&#8208; and Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) encoding method featuring a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221; is described, which allows efficient interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA forms. Hybridization and covalent crosslinking of ssDEL with diversified complementary functionalized DNAs enables multiple DEL applications.







Abstract
The use of a proper encoding methodology is one of the most important aspects when practicing DEL technology. A &#8220;headpiece&#8221;&#8208;based double&#8208;stranded DEL encoding method is currently the most widely used for productive DEL. However, the robustness of double&#8208;stranded DEL construction conflicts with the versatility presented by single&#8208;stranded DEL applications. We here report a novel encoding method, which is based on a &#8220;reversible covalent headpiece (RCHP)&#8221;. The RCHP allows reversible interconversion between double&#8208; and single&#8208;stranded DNA formats, providing an avenue to robust synthesis and allowing for the applications in distinct setups. We have validated the versatility of this encoding method with encoded self&#8208;assembled chemical library and DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic library technology. Notably, based on the RCHP&#8208;settled library construction, a unique &#8220;ternary covalent complex&#8221; mediating ligand isolation methodology against non&#8208;immobilized targets was developed.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction Kinetics on Atomically Dispersed Monovalent ZnI Sites by Rationally Engineering Proton&#8208;Feeding Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed twisted ZnI&#8208;N3+1 structure was developed to accelerate a proton&#8208;feeding process that reduces the energy barrier of, and thereby promotes, the kinetics of the CO2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for CO2 utilization, however the CO2RR process involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer is greatly limited by poor selectivity and low yield. Herein, We have developed an atomically dispersed monovalent zinc catalyst anchored on nitrogenated carbon nanosheets (Zn/NC NSs). Benefiting from the unique coordination environment and atomic dispersion, the Zn/NC NSs exhibit a superior CO2RR performance, featuring a high current density up to 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an outstanding CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;%. The center ZnI atom coordinated with three N atoms and one N atom that bridges over two adjacent graphitic edges (Zn&#8208;N3+1) is identified as the catalytically active site. Experimental results reveal that the twisted Zn&#8208;N3+1 structure accelerates CO2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *CO2 to *COOH, while theoretical calculations elucidate that atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N3+1 moieties decrease the potential barriers for intermediate COOH* formation, promoting the proton&#8208;coupled CO2RR kinetics and boosting the overall catalytic performance.

         <title>A General Approach to Design Dual Ratiometric Fluorescent and Photoacoustic Probes for Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor Hypoxia Levels In&#8197;Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a general energy balance approach by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized platform, the first dual&#8208;ratio NIRF/PA response probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2 was designed for quantitatively and precisely monitoring of tumor hypoxia levels in vivo.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an energy balance strategy between fluorescence and photoacoustic effects by sulfur substitution to transform existing hemicyanine dyes (Cy) into optimized NIRF/PA dual ratiometric scaffolds. Based on this optimized scaffold, we reported the first dual&#8208;ratio response of nitroreductase probe AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, which allows quantitative visualization of tumor hypoxia in&#8197;vivo. AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;NO2, composed of a new NIRF/PA scaffold thioxanthene&#8208;hemicyanine (AS&#8208;Cy&#8208;1) and a 4&#8208;nitrobenzene moiety, showed a 10&#8208;fold ratiometric NIRF enhancement (I773/I733) and 2.4&#8208;fold ratiometric PA enhancement (PA730/PA670) upon activation by a biomarker (nitroreductase, NTR) associated with tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the dual ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging accurately quantified the hypoxia extent with high sensitivity and high imaging depth in xenograft breast cancer models. More importantly, the 3D maximal intensity projection (MIP) PA images of the probe can precisely differentiate the highly heterogeneous oxygen distribution in solid tumor. Thus, this study provides a promising NIRF/PA scaffold that may be generalized for the dual ratiometric imaging of other disease&#8208;relevant biomarkers.

         <title>Back Cover: Self&#8208;Expanding Ion&#8208;Transport Channels on Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 7/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode is proposed by Guoxing Li, Yuliang Li, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202113313). The self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels can be achieved by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling. They reduce the energy barrier of lithium&#8208;ion transport, accelerate lithium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion, and thus enable an excellent fast&#8208;charging performance.

Indomethacin is an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form&#8197;&#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. By using a combination of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED or MicroED) and microdroplet melt crystallization, Ming Lu, Hongyi Xu et&#8197;al. reveal in their Research Article (e202114985) that Form&#8197;&#948; consists of two plastically bendable crystal forms. This discovery and the correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that MicroED diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.

A loop deletion mutant of outer membrane protein&#8197;F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of decoy molecules into Escherichia coli has been developed. In their Communication (e202111612), Osami Shoji and co&#8208;workers report that co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type CYP102A1 enables an E.&#8197;coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene, alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes with the help of decoy molecules, bringing this system a significant step closer to practical applications.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Peptide and Protein Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine reagents are commonly used for the development of novel transformations. As they are highly reactive and biocompatible, they have been employed more recently for the functionalization of biomolecules. This Minireview discusses the development of hypervalent iodine reagents for the modification of peptides and proteins as well as their application, such as for labeling and peptide stapling.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine compounds are powerful reagents for the development of novel transformations. As they exhibit low toxicity, high functional group tolerance, and stability in biocompatible media, they have been used for the functionalization of biomolecules. Herein, we report recent advances up to June 2021 in peptide and protein modification using hypervalent iodine reagents. Their use as group transfer or oxidizing reagents is discussed in this Minireview, including methods targeting polar, aromatic, or aliphatic amino acids and peptide termini.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Monofluoroalkylation: Strategies for the Synthesis of Alkyl Fluorides by C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. Strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, but they have been studied less than strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;F bond formation (fluorination).







Abstract
Alkyl fluorides modulate the conformation, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and pKa of compounds containing aliphatic motifs and, therefore, have been valuable for medicinal chemistry. Despite significant research in organofluorine chemistry, the synthesis of alkyl fluorides, especially chiral alkyl fluorides, remains a challenge. Most commonly, alkyl fluorides are prepared by the formation of C&#8722;F bonds (fluorination), and numerous strategies for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorination have been reported in recent years. Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8722;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, they have been studied less than methods based on fluorination. This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. We expect this contribution will illuminate the potential of monofluoroalkylations to simplify the synthesis of complex alkyl fluorides and suggest further research directions in this growing field.

         <title>Chemical Batteries with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable energy systems cannot exist without the storage of volatile renewable electricity. Whereas electrical batteries can be used for small amounts of energy, chemical batteries are required for large amounts of energy. The hydrogenation of CO2 is one promising option for chemical batteries. The intricate material science of Cu catalysts to control the selectivity of this reaction is discussed in detail in this Review.







Abstract
Efforts to obtain raw materials from CO2 by catalytic reduction as a means of combating greenhouse gas emissions are pushing the boundaries of the chemical industry. The dimensions of modern energy regimes, on the one hand, and the necessary transport and trade of globally produced renewable energy, on the other, will require the use of chemical batteries in conjunction with the local production of renewable electricity. The synthesis of methanol is an important option for chemical batteries and will, for that reason, be described here in detail. It is also shown that the necessary, robust, and fundamental understanding of processes and the material science of catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO2 does not yet exist.

         <title>Controlling the Complexity and Interconversion Mechanisms in Self&#8208;Assembled [Fe2L3]4+ Helicates and [Fe4L6]8+ Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic system of interconverting helicates and cages was prepared and characterized. The presence of steric bulk on the central ring of the ligand was found to control both the complexity and interconversion mechanism.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled coordination cages and metal&#8211;organic frameworks have relied extensively on symmetric ligands in their formation. Here we have prepared a relatively simple system employing an unsymmetric ligand that results in two distinct self&#8208;assembled structures, a [Fe2L3]4+ helicate and a [Fe4L6]8+ cage composed of 10 interconverting diastereomers and their enantiomers. We show that the steric profile of the ligand controls the complexity, thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversion of the system.

         <title>Relating Conformational Equilibria to Conformer&#8208;Specific Lipophilicities: New Opportunities in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catching conformations: Lipophilicity (logP) is a molecular property which is nevertheless the weighted average of the lipophilicities of the individual conformers. The first direct measurement of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicity values is presented, together with the introduction of a new avenue for rational lipophilicity optimization of drug candidates which is focused on modification of conformational equilibria in water and in octanol.







Abstract
Efficient drug discovery is based on a concerted effort in optimizing bioactivity and compound properties such as lipophilicity, and is guided by efficiency metrics that reflect both aspects. While conformation&#8211;activity relationships and ligand conformational control are known strategies to improve bioactivity, the use of conformer&#8208;specific lipophilicities (logp) is much less explored. Here we show how conformer&#8208;specific logp values can be obtained from knowledge of the macroscopic logP value, and of the equilibrium constants between the individual species in water and in octanol. This is illustrated with fluorinated amide rotamers, with integration of rotamer 19F NMR signals as a facile, direct method to obtain logp values. The difference between logp and logP optimization is highlighted, giving rise to a novel avenue for lipophilicity control in drug discovery.

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amides via Highly Chemoselective N&#8722;C Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation is reported. The protocol advances the biorelevant amide bond cross&#8208;coupling manifold to solid&#8208;state solventless cross&#8208;coupling methods.







Abstract
Although cross&#8208;coupling reactions of amides by selective N&#8722;C cleavage are one of the most powerful and burgeoning areas in organic synthesis due to the ubiquity of amide bonds, the development of mechanochemical, solid&#8208;state methods remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the first mechanochemical strategy for highly chemoselective, solvent&#8208;free palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of amides by N&#8722;C bond activation. The method is conducted in the absence of external heating, for short reaction time and shows excellent chemoselectivity for &#963; N&#8722;C bond activation. The reaction shows excellent functional group tolerance and can be applied to late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex APIs and sequential orthogonal cross&#8208;couplings exploiting double solventless solid&#8208;state methods. The results extend mechanochemical reaction environments to advance the chemical repertoire of N&#8722;C bond interconversions to solid&#8208;state environmentally friendly mechanochemical methods.

A new family of lithium&#8208;conducting methacrylic polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is discussed. The optimized borate homopolymer shows the highest ionic conductivity reported for a single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolyte for lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
A family of single&#8208;ion lithium conducting polymer electrolytes based on highly delocalized borate groups is reported. The effect of the nature of the substituents on the boron atom on the ionic conductivity of the resultant methacrylic polymers was analyzed. To the best of our knowledge the lithium borate polymers endowed with flexible and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents presents the highest ionic conductivity reported for a lithium single&#8208;ion conducting homopolymer (1.65&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C). This together with its high lithium transference number t
=0.93 and electrochemical stability window of 4.2&#8197;V vs Li0/Li+ show promise for application in lithium batteries. To illustrate this, a lithium borate monomer was integrated into a single&#8208;ion gel polymer electrolyte which showed good performance on lithium symmetrical cells (&lt;0.85&#8197;V at &#177;0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 175&#8197;h).

         <title>Two Giant Calixarene&#8208;Like Polyoxoniobate Nanocups {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} Built from Mixed Macrocyclic Cluster Motifs</title>

Calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobates: Two unprecedented giant calixarene&#8208;like polyoxoniobate (PONb) nanocups based on multiple macrocyclic clusters have been made, showing the fusion of two areas of metallacalixarene and PONb chemistry. The two molecular nanocups are by far the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs and hold promise for developing largely unexplored inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONb chemistry.







Abstract
Cup&#8208;shaped molecules are of great interest due to their appealing architectures and properties. Compared with widely studied calixarenes, polyoxometalate&#8208;based cup&#8208;shaped molecules currently remain a virgin land waiting for exploration. In this work, we report the first discovery of two giant cup&#8208;shaped inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs) of {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128}. The former integrates three tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a hexacyclic Nb48 cluster into a cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a Cu12 metallacalixarene, while the latter unifies two tricyclic Nb24 clusters and a brand&#8208;new pentacyclic Nb40 cluster into another cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a hybrid Cd16 unit. With 132 and 144 metal centers, {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} show the largest two inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid PONbs known to date.

         <title>Deoxygenation of Nitrous Oxide and Nitro Compounds Using Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene)Amido Iron Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient catalytic degradation of N2O to N2 by well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complexes under mild conditions involving the cooperative effect between the iron and silylene ligands is reported. Selective reductions of nitro compounds to amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity have been developed using the same approach.







Abstract
Herein, we report the efficient degradation of N2O with a well&#8208;defined bis(silylene)amido iron complex as catalyst. The deoxygenation of N2O using the iron silanone complex 4 as a catalyst and pinacolborane (HBpin) as a sacrificial reagent proceeds smoothly at 50&#8201;&#176;C to form N2, H2, and (pinB)2O. Mechanistic studies suggest that the iron&#8211;silicon cooperativity is the key to this catalytic transformation, which involves N2O activation, H atom transfer, H2 release and oxygenation of the boron sites. This approach has been further developed to enable catalytic reductions of nitro compounds, producing amino&#8208;boranes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity.

         <title>Identification of Cyclopropane Formation in the Biosyntheses of Hormaomycins and Belactosins: Sequential Nitration and Cyclopropanation by Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of amino/nitro&#8208;cyclopropylalanine moieties in hormaomycin and belactosin was fully elucidated. The pathway involves six&#8208;electron oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine by heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes (HrmI/BelK) and C&#8722;C bond formation by iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases (HrmJ/BelL). This is the first example of Fe/&#945;&#8208;KG oxygenase&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropane formation.







Abstract
Hormaomycins and belactosins are peptide natural products that contain unusual cyclopropane moieties. Bioinformatics analysis of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters showed that two conserved genes, hrmI/belK and hrmJ/belL, were potential candidates for catalyzing cyclopropanation. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, the functions of HrmI/BelK and HrmJ/BelL were established. HrmI and BelK, which are heme oxygenase&#8208;like dinuclear iron enzymes, catalyze oxidation of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine to afford l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine. Subsequently, HrmJ and BelL, which are iron&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenases, effectively convert l&#8208;6&#8208;nitronorleucine into 3&#8208;(trans&#8208;2&#8208;nitrocyclopropyl)&#8208;alanine through C4&#8722;C6 bond installation. These observations disclose a novel pathway of cyclopropane ring construction and exemplify the new chemistry involving metalloenzymes in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Preparation of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Carboxylic Acids by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Mixed Anhydrides**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids are rapidly converted into potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of their mixed anhydrides. This scalable method is compatible with a broad range of functional groups and allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic and aromatic KATs, including KATs derived from Fmoc&#8208; and Boc&#8208;protected amino acids.







Abstract
We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B2(pin)2, and aqueous KHF2. This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid&#8208;derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.

This scalable method is compatible with a broad range of functional groups and allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic and aromatic KATs, including KATs derived from Fmoc- and Boc-protected amino acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(pin)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and aqueous KHF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid-derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Heme&#8208;Acquisition Protein Reconstructed with a Cobalt 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation and Its Growth&#8208;Inhibition Activity Toward Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations were synthesized, and a cobalt(II) 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reconstructed protein strongly inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa and multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
Using artificial hemes for the reconstruction of natural heme proteins represents a fascinating approach to enhance the bioactivity of the latter. We report the synthesis of various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations as cofactors, and a cobalt 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesize that the oxaporphyrinium cation strongly binds to the HasA&#8208;specific outer membrane receptor (HasR) due to its cationic charge, which prevents the subsequent acquisition of heme. In fact, the reconstructed HasA inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and even of multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.

         <title>Formation of Super&#8208;Assembled TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Inverse Opal Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (TZNC IO) structure is designed through a multi&#8208;step method to regulate Zn deposition for Zn metal anodes. Benefitting from the ordered open structure with abundant zincophilic sites, the TZNC host can realize a preferential Zn nucleation and growth in the confined space. As expected, the dendrite&#8208;free TZNC@Zn composite anode enables long&#8208;term cycling in both symmetric and full cells.







Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions are the major restrictions for the commercialization of Zn metal anodes. Herein, we develop a TiOx/Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon inverse opal (denoted as TZNC IO) host to regulate the Zn deposition. Amorphous TiOx and Zn/N&#8208;doped carbon can serve as the zincophilic nucleation sites to prevent the parasitic reactions. More importantly, the highly ordered IO host homogenizes the local current density and electric field to stabilize Zn deposition. Furthermore, the three&#8208;dimensional open networks could regulate Zn ion flux to enable stable cycling performance at large current densities. Owing to the abundant zincophilic sites and the open structure, granular Zn deposits could be realized. As expected, the TZNC IO host guarantees the steady Zn plating/stripping with a long&#8208;term stability over 450&#8197;h at the current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a TZNC@Zn||V2O5 full cell shows long lifespan over 2000&#8197;cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>An Unusual Pair: Facile Formation and In Vivo Validation of Robust Sc&#8211;18F Ternary Complexes for Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot water&#8208;compatible and high&#8208;yielding radiofluorination approach by the displacement of a labile, inner&#8208;sphere water of a seven&#8208;coordinate Sc chelate with a 18F&#8722; ion to form the first fully inert and water&#8208;compatible Sc&#8211;18F ternary coordination complex. The corresponding complex is fully in vivo compatible and can be the diagnostic PET imaging partner to the corresponding 47Sc&#8208;labeled endoradiotherapeutic.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 remains the most widely clinically utilized radionuclide globally for positron emission tomography (PET). The emergence of therapeutic isotopes for the management of disease has produced a pronounced interest in matched, theranostic isotope pairs that can be employed in tandem for the diagnosis and stratification of patients for subsequent radiotherapy. 18F, however, does not have a suitable therapeutic isotopologue. Here, we demonstrate that the formation of [18F][Sc&#8722;F] ternary complexes is feasible under mild, aqueous conditions, producing chemically robust radiopharmaceuticals in high radiochemical yield and specific activity. A corresponding in vivo study with a cancer&#8208;targeting [18F][Sc&#8722;F] tracer indicates excellent in vivo stability and produces exquisite PET image quality, rendering the 18F/47Sc isotope pair an unusual, yet chemically matched theranostic pair with excellent potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Designer Outer Membrane Protein Facilitates Uptake of Decoy Molecules into a Cytochrome P450BM3&#8208;Based Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of outer membrane protein F (OmpF) that facilitates the cellular uptake of amino acid derivatives as decoy molecules has been developed. Co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 enabled the Escherichia coli&#8208;based whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst to efficiently oxidise benzene with the assistance of decoy molecules. Moreover, whole&#8208;cell&#8208;catalysed stereoselective hydroxylation was achieved by changing the decoy molecule.







Abstract
We report an OmpF loop deletion mutant, which improves the cellular uptake of external additives into an Escherichia coli whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst. Through co&#8208;expression of the OmpF mutant with wild&#8208;type P450BM3 in the presence of decoy molecules, the yield of the whole&#8208;cell biotransformation of benzene could be considerably improved. Notably, with the decoy molecule C7AM&#8208;Pip&#8208;Phe the yield duodecupled from 5.7&#8201;% to 70&#8201;%, with 80&#8201;% phenol selectivity. The benzylic hydroxylation of alkyl&#8208; and cycloalkylbenzenes was also examined, and with the aid of decoy molecules, propylbenzene and tetralin were converted to 1&#8208;hydroxylated products with 78&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (R) ee for propylbenzene and 92&#8201;% yield and 94&#8201;% (S) ee for tetralin. Our results suggest that both the decoy molecule and substrate traverse the artificial OmpF channel, synergistically boosting whole&#8208;cell bioconversions.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Oxazaborolidines by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H Double Activation of 1,2&#8208;Azaborines</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;azaborines has been demonstrated. A wide variety of 1,2&#8208;azaborines underwent cycloaddition with vinylethylene carbonate through N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H bond cleavage to produce unique polycyclic oxazaborolidines under mild conditions. Furthermore, highly enantioselective direct functionalization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines afforded chiral tricyclic oxazaborolidines.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;H/B&#8722;H double activation of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines proceeded via cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonate to produce polycyclic oxazaborolidines in 31&#8211;96&#8201;% yield. The key step in this process is the release of molecular hydrogen from a borate intermediate. Using a SPINOL&#8208;derived phosphoramidite as a chiral ligand, chiral oxazaborolidines were synthesized in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee). The vinyl group of the resulting oxazaborolidine underwent metathesis, Heck reaction, and Wacker oxidation without affecting the oxazaborolidine framework.

         <title>Crossed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Iron&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Unactivated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated branched and linear dienes is described. The illustrated process provides a very efficient and atom&#8208;economic access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes under very mild reaction conditions. The development of a chiral bis&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligand class was essential to obtain excellent levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The cyclohexene motif is ubiquitous in nature and specialty chemicals. A straightforward selective access to chiral cyclohexenes from unactivated dienes and dienophiles is not feasible by classical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and constitutes an unsolved synthetic challenge. We report a mild and enantioselective iron&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;[4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of unactivated dienes providing access to chiral 1,3&#8208;substituted vinyl&#8208;cyclohexenes. The development of bis&#8208;dihydroisoquinoline ligands was vital to obtain iron complexes that display high reactivities and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities towards the targeted cyclohexenes. A range of diene substrates is well accommodated including feedstocks like butadiene, isoprene and myrcene. The structures of different iron complexes are mapped by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and linked to their performance.

         <title>Collateral Damage Occurs When Using Photosensitizer Probes to Detect or Modulate Nucleic Acid Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifications of DNA/RNA impact their properties including susceptibility to oxidation. 5&#8208;Methylcytosine and N6&#8208;methyladenine were competed for photooxidation by riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal against dA, dG, dC, and dT in DNA. This confirmed dG is more oxidation prone, representing collateral damage during photosensitized probing for the base methylations.







Abstract
Nucleic acids are chemically modified to fine&#8208;tune their properties for biological function. Chemical tools for selective tagging of base modifications enables new approaches; the photosensitizers riboflavin and anthraquinone were previously proposed to oxidize N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A) or 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mdC) selectively. Herein, riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal were allowed to react with the canonical nucleosides dA, dC, dG, and dT, and the modified bases 5mdC, m6A, 8&#8208;oxoguanine (dOG), and 8&#8208;oxoadenine (dOA) to rank their reactivities. The nucleoside studies reveal that dOG is the most reactive and that the native nucleoside dG is higher or similar in reactivity to 5mdC or m6A; competition in both single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA of dG vs. 5mdC or 6mdA for oxidant confirmed that dG is favorably oxidized. Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.

         <title>2D Active Nanobots Based on Soft Nanoarchitectonics Powered by an Ultralow Fuel Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Truly&#8221; two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanobots based on graphene oxide and powered by enzymes have been fabricated by facile noncovalent interactions. The 2D nanobots can be propelled at ultralow H2O2 concentrations and show chemotactic behavior. Furthermore, in the presence of fuel, they showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye for environmental remediation.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis to power micro/nanomotors has received tremendous attention because of the vast potential in applications ranging from biomedicine to environmental remediation. However, the current design is mainly based on a complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architecture, with limited accessible surface areas for the catalytic sites, and thus requires a higher fuel concentration to achieve active motion. Herein we report for the first time an enzyme&#8208;powered 2D nanobot, which was designed by a facile strategy based on soft nanoarchitectonics for active motion at an ultralow fuel concentration (0.003&#8201;% H2O2). The 2D nanobots exhibited efficient positive chemotactic behavior and the ability to swim against gravity by virtue of solutal buoyancy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the 2D nanobots showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye with an efficiency of 85&#8201;%.

         <title>Optical Cell Tagging for Spatially Resolved Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
OpTAG (optical cell tagging) is a novel chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. In combination with cell sorting and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq), OpTAG&#8208;seq enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for profiling gene expression of distinct cell populations at the single&#8208;cell level. However, the information of the positions of cells within the multicellular samples is missing in scRNA&#8208;seq datasets. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop OpTAG (optical cell tagging) as a new chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. With OpTAG, we establish OpTAG&#8208;seq, which enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq. We apply OpTAG&#8208;seq to investigate the spatially defined transcriptional program in migrating cancer cells and identified a list of genes that are potential regulators for cancer cell migration and invasion. OpTAG&#8208;seq provides a convenient method for mapping cellular heterogeneity with spatial information within multicellular biological systems.

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacidity of Non&#8208;Planar Boranes: C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Non&#8208;Classical Binding Modes at Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 7, February 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taming the Lewis superacidity of a pyramidal borane by weakly coordinated anion dissociation enabled the activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds and resulted in an unusual coordination mode at boron.







Abstract
The rational design of a geometrically constrained boron Lewis superacid featuring exceptional structure and reactivity is disclosed. It enabled the formation of non&#8208;classical electron deficient B&#8722;H&#8722;B type of bonding, which was supported by spectroscopic and structural parameters as well as computational studies. Taming the pyramidal Lewis acid electrophilicity through weak coordinating anion dissociation enabled a series of highly challenging chemical transformations, such as Csp2&#8722;H and Csp3&#8722;H activation under a frustrated Lewis pair regime and the cleavage of Csp3&#8722;Si bonds. The demonstration of such rich chemical behaviour and flexibility on a single molecular compound makes it a unique mediator of chemical transformations generally restricted to transition metals.

         <title>Reversible Three&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching of an Organic Molecule in the Solid State via &#8220;Pump&#8208;Trigger&#8221; Optical Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photoswitches that undergo fluorescence switching upon ultraviolet irradiation, photoluminescence and photoisomerization often occur simultaneously, leading to unstable fluorescence properties. Here, we successfully demonstrated reversible solid&#8208;state triple fluorescence switching through "Pump&#8208;Trigger" multiphoton manipulation. A novel fluorescence photoswitch, BOSA&#8208;SP, achieved green, yellow, and red fluorescence under excitation by pump light and isomerization induced by trigger light. The energy ranges of photoexcitation and photoisomerization did not overlap, enabling appropriate selection of the multiphoton light for &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; photoswitching, respectively. Additionally, the large free volume of the spiropyran (SP) moiety in the solid state promoted reversible photoisomerization. Switching between &#8220;pump&#8221; and &#8220;trigger&#8221; light is useful for three&#8208;color tunable switching cell imaging, which can be exploited in programmable fluorescence switching. Furthermore, we exploited reversible dual&#8208;fluorescence switching in a single molecular system to successfully achieve two&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Shizukaol J, Trichloranoid C and Trishizukaol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric total synthesis of three lindenane sesquiterpenoid oligomers, i.e. shizukaol J, trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A, has been accomplished concisely in 15, 16 and 18 longest linear steps respectively. The expeditious construction of molecular architectures was facilitated by Nelson&#8217;s catalytic asymmetric ketene&#8208;aldehyde cycloaddition, a sequence of allylic alkylation/reduction/acidic cyclization to forge a lactone, and a double aldol condensation cascade to construct the 5/6 bicyclic system. Diastereoselective nucleophilic substitution promoted by a phase transfer catalyst constructed the C  11  quaternary stereogenic center, thus prompting synthetic efficacy toward shizukaol J. The synthesis of trichloranoid C and trishizukaol A was achieved after a cascade involving furanyl diene formation and a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, as well as a one&#8208;pot sequence involving furan oxidation and global deprotection. Furthermore, our biological evaluation revealed that two compounds exhibited unexpected toxicity against tumor cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Helicenes by a Tailored Chiral Benzo[ghi]perylene Trisimide &#960;&#8208;Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective molecular recognition of chiral molecules that lack specific interaction sites for hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions remains challenging. Here we introduce the concept of tailored chiral &#960;&#8208;surfaces toward the maximization of shape complementarity. As we demonstrate for helicenes it is indeed possible by pure van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions (&#960;&#8722;&#960;&#8208;interactions and CH&#8722;&#960;&#8208;interactions) to accomplish enantioselective binding. This is demonstrated for a novel benzo[ghi]perylene trisimide (BPTI) receptor whose &#960;&#8208;scaffold is contorted into a chiral plane by functionalization with 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL). Complexation experiments of enantiopure  (P)&#8208;  BPTI with  (P)&#8208;  and  (M)&#8208;  [6]helicene afforded binding constants of 10700 M  &#8722;1  and 550 M  &#8722;1  , respectively, thereby demonstrating the pronounced enantiodifferentiation by the homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffold of the BPTI host. The enantioselective recognition is even observable by the bare eye due to a specific exciplex&#8208;type emission originating from the interacting homochiral &#960;&#8208;scaffolds of electron&#8208;rich [6]helicene and electron&#8208;poor BPTI.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging electron&#8208;deficient iminium intermediates in a general synthesis of valuable amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of Quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Supported Lanthanum Borohydride Catalyzes CH Borylation Inside Zeolite Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite&#8208;supported lanthanide La(BH  4  )  x  &#8208;HY  30  catalyzes C&#8722;H borylation of benzene with pinacolborane (HBpin), providing a complementary approach to precious, late transition metal&#8208;catalyzed borylations. The reactive catalytic species are generated from La grafted at the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in micropores of the zeolite, whereas silanoate&#8208; and aluminoate&#8208;grafted sites are inactive under the reaction conditions. During typical catalytic borylations, conversion to phenyl pinacolborane (PhBpin) is zero&#8208;order in HBpin concentration. A turnover number (TON) of 167 is accessed by capping silanols, selectively grafting at BAS sites, and adding HBpin slowly to the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time NMR Recording of Fermentation and Lipid Metabolism&#160;Processes&#160;in Live Microalgae Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time recording of processes in living cells has been limited to detection of small cellular components such as soluble proteins and metabolites. Here we report a multiphase NMR approach using Magic&#8208;Angle Spinning NMR to synchronously follow microbial processes of fermentation, lipid metabolism and structural dynamic changes in live microalgae cells.  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  green algae were highly concentrated, introducing dark fermentation and anoxia conditions. Single&#8208;pulse NMR experiments were applied to obtain temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic profiles of the formed fermentation products. Through dynamics&#8208;based spectral editing NMR, simultaneous conversion of galactolipids into TAG and free fatty acids was observed and rapid loss of rigid lipid structures. This suggests that lipolysis under dark and anoxia conditions finally results in the breakdown of cell and organelle membranes, which could be beneficial for recovery of intracellular microbial useful products.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Boric Acid Does Not Show Room Temperature Phosphorescence (RTP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boric acid (BA) has been used as a transparent glass matrix for optical materials for over 100 years. However, recently, apparent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from BA (crystalline and powder states) was reported (Zheng et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2021, 60, 9500) when irradiated at 280 nm under ambient conditions. We suspected that RTP from their BA sample was induced by an unidentified impurity. Our experimental results show that pure BA synthesized from B(OMe)3 does not luminesce in the solid state when irradiated at 250&#8208;400 nm, while commercial BA indeed (faintly) luminesces. Our theoretical calculations show that neither individual BA molecules nor aggregates would absorb light at &gt;175 nm, and we observe no absorption of solid pure BA experimentally at &gt;200 nm. Therefore, it is not possible for pure BA to be excited at &gt;250 nm even in the solid state. Thus, pure BA does not display RTP whereas trace impurities can induce RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF Synthesis Prediction Enabled by Automatic Data Mining and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite rapid progress in the field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the potential of using machine learning (ML) methods to predict MOF synthesis parameters is still untapped. Here, we show how ML can be used for rationalization and acceleration of the MOF discovery process by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. Our approach is based on: (i) establishing the first MOF synthesis database via automatic extraction of synthesis parameters from the literature, (ii) training and optimizing ML models by employing the MOF database, and (iii) predicting the synthesis conditions for new MOF structures. The ML models, even at an initial stage, exhibit a good prediction performance, outperforming human expert predictions, obtained through a synthesis survey. The automated synthesis prediction is available via a web&#8208;tool on https://mof&#8208;synthesis.aimat.science.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Catalysed Dissolution of Elemental Gold in Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold is a scarce element in the Earth&#8217;s crust but indispensable in modern electronic devices. New, sustainable methods of gold recycling are essential to meet the growing eco&#8208;social demand of gold. Here, we describe a simple, inexpensive, and environmentally benign dissolution of gold under mild conditions. Gold dissolves quantitatively in ethanol using 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole as a ligand in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine. Mechanistically, the dissolution of gold begins when I  2  oxidizes Au  0  and forms [Au  I  I  2  ]  &#8208;  species, which undergoes subsequent ligand&#8208;exchange reactions and forms a stable bis&#8208;ligand Au(I) complex. H  2  O  2  oxidizes free iodide and regenerated I  2  returns back to the catalytic cycle. Addition of a reductant to the reaction mixture precipitates gold quantitatively and partially regenerates the ligand. We anticipate our work will open new pathway to more sustainable metal recycling with utilization of just catalytic amounts of reagents and green solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monotonous luminescence has always been a major factor limiting the application of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Enhancing and regulating the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest is an effective strategy to achieve excellent phosphorescence performance. In this study, intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8230;Br) was introduced into the host&#8208;guest RTP system. The interaction promoted intersystem crossing and stabilized the triplet excitons, thus helping to achieve strong phosphorescence emission. In addition, the weak intermolecular interaction of halogen bonding is sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, mechanical force, and X&#8208;rays. Therefore, the triplet excitons were easily quenched and colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli responsive behaviors were realized, which greatly enriched the luminescence functionality of the RTP materials. This method provides a new platform for the future design of responsive RTP materials based on weak intermolecular interactions between the host and guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral Aldehydes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic&#8208;Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization Followed by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially  chiral aldehydes have received increasing attention in enantioselective catalysis. However, only very few catalytic methods have been developed to construct structurally diverse axially chiral aldehydes. We herein describe an NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective esterification of biaryl dialdehydes as a general and practical strategy for the construction of axially chiral aldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that coupling proceeds through a novel combination of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization of the dialdehydes and kinetic resolution. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, mild conditions, good functional&#8208;group tolerance, and applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization and provides a modular platform for the synthesis of axially chiral aldehydes and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Controllable Efficiency Enabled by an Annulene&#8208;Based Anisotropic Fluid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of controllable artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems based on liquid crystal (LC) materials,  i.e., anisotropic fluids, remains a challenge. Herein, an annulene&#8208;based discotic LC compound  6  with a saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene core has been synthesized to construct a tunable light&#8208;harvesting platform. The LC material shows typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which can act as a suitable light&#8208;harvesting donor. By loading Nile red (NiR) as an acceptor, an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system is achieved. Relying on the thermal&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembling ability of  6  with variable molecular order, the efficiency of such  6  &#8208;NiR system can be controlled by temperature. This light&#8208;harvesting system works sensitively at a high donor/acceptor ratio as 1000:1, and exhibits a high antenna effect (39.1) at a 100:1 donor/acceptor ratio. This thermochromic artificial light&#8208;harvesting LC system could find potential applications in smart devices employing soft materials.</dc:description>
