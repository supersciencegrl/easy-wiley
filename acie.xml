      <title>A Polymorphic Azobenzene Cage for Energy&#8208;Efficient and Highly Selective p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
A stable and recyclable non&#8208;porous azobenzene&#8208;based organic cage (AZO&#8208;Cage) that exhibits exclusive selectivity towards p&#8208;xylene (pX) compared to all C8 isomers is reported by N.&#8197;M. Khashab and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007782). This AZO&#8208;Cage undergoes a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition selectively in the presence of pX in both liquid and vapor phase, which makes this platform ideal for eventual translation for the separation of high value benzene derivatives. The cover image illustrates the host cage crystal transition in the presence of pX guest molecules.

      <title>Biomedical Applications of Calixarenes: State of the Art and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>

Abstract
Calixarenes (CAs), representing the third generation of supramolecular hosts and one of the most widely studied macrocyclic scaffolds, offer (almost) unlimited structure and application possibilities due to their ease of modification, which allows one to establish a large molecular library as a material basis for diverse biomedical applications. Moreover, CAs and their derivatives engage in various noncovalent interactions for the facile recognition of guests including bioactive molecules and are also important building blocks for the fabrication of supramolecular architectures. In view of their molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly properties, CAs are extensively applied in biosensing, bioimaging, and drug/gene delivery. Additionally, some CA derivatives exhibit biological activities and can therefore be used as new therapeutic agents. Herein, we summarize the diverse biomedical applications of CAs including in vitro diagnosis (biosensing), in vivo diagnosis (bioimaging), and therapy.

      <title>Sequential Chiral Induction and Regulator&#8208;assisted Chiral Memory of Pillar[5]arenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Chirality transfer is widely observed in life processes. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010050), T. Ogoshi and co&#8208;workers introduce a new non&#8208;direct chiral transfer system, in which the chiral induction and memory processes within a single system via the synergistic interactions of a chiral regulator and inducer. The inducer induces planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes, and the regulator memorizes the planar chirality. Memorization of the planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes by the regulator (net) is illustrated.

      <title>The Optical Spectrum of Au2+</title>
      <dc:description>
The first optical spectrum of Au2+ derived by electronic photodissociation is analysed with quantum chemical calculations in the Communication by M. F&#246;rstel, R. Mitric, O. Dopfer, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011337).

Abstract
Severe side effects and poor therapeutic efficacy are the main drawbacks of current anticancer drugs. These problems can be mitigated by targeting, but the targeting efficacy of current drugs is poor and urgently needs improvement. Taking this into consideration, this Review first summarizes the current targeting strategies for cancer therapy in terms of cancer tissue and organelles. Then, we analyse the systematic targeting of anticancer drugs and conclude that a typical journey for a targeted drug administered by intravenous injection is a CTIO cascade of at least four steps. Furthermore, to ensure high overall targeting efficacy, the properties of a targeting drug needed in each step are further analysed, and some guidelines for structure optimization to obtain effective targeting drugs are offered. Finally, some viewpoints highlighting the crucial problems and potential challenges of future research on targeted cancer therapy are presented. This review could actively promote the development of precision medicine against cancer.

Dense sphere packing or network? An open octahedral network structure formed by soft self&#8208;assembly is reported by C. Tschierske, F. Liu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008784). &#960;&#8208;conjugated rods form the networks conjoined by eight&#8208;way junctions, representing nano&#8208;segregated spheres involving the hydrogen bonded polar end groups. This liquid organic framework is the first cubic liquid crystalline phase combining a network based on the I&#8208;WP minimal surface and a body centered cubic sphere packing.

      <title>Water&#8208;Stable DMASnBr3 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite for Effective Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Water&#8208;stable metal halide perovskites could foster tremendous progresses in several research fields where their superior optical properties can make differences. In this work we report clear evidence of water stability in a lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite, namely DMASnBr3, obtained by means of diffraction, optical and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Such unprecedented water&#8208;stability has been applied to promote photocatalysis in aqueous medium, in particular by devising a novel composite material by coupling DMASnBr3 to g&#8208;C3N4, taking advantage from the combination of their optimal photophysical properties. The prepared composites provide an impressive hydrogen evolution rate &gt;1700 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 generated by the synergistic activity of the two composite costituents. DFT calculations provide insight into this enhancement deriving it from the favorable alignment of interfacial energy levels of DMASnBr3 and g&#8208;C3N4. The demonstration of an efficient photocatalytic activity for a composite based on lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite in water paves the way to a new class of light&#8208;driven catalysts working in aqueous environments.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dinickel Catalyzed Cyclopropanation without the Formation of a Metal Carbene Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>(NDI)Ni2  catalysts (NDI = naphthyridine&#8211;diimine) promote cyclopropanation reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes using (Me3Si)CHN2  . Mechanistic studies reveal that a metal carbene intermediate is not part of the catalytic cycle. The (NDI)Ni2(CHSiMe3) complex was independently synthesized and found to be unreactive toward dienes.

      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to C2 hydrocarbons with oxygen (O  2  &#8208;OCM) has garnered renewed worldwide interest in the past decade due to the emergence of enormous new shale gas resources. However, the C2 selectivity of typical OCM processes is significantly challenged by overoxidation to CO  x  products. Other gaseous reagents such as N  2  O, CO  2  , and S  2  have been investigated to a far lesser extent as alternative, milder oxidants to replace O  2  . Although several authoritative review articles have summarized OCM research progress in depth, recent oxidative coupling developments using alternative oxidants (X&#8208;OCM) have not been overviewed in detail. In this perspective, we review and analyze OCM research results reporting the implementation of N  2  O, CO  2  , S  2  , and other non&#8208;O  2  oxidants, highlighting the unique chemistries of these systems and their advantages/challenges compared to O  2  &#8208;OCM. Current outlook and potential areas for future study are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalyst Controlled Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Alkynylation of Thiophenes</title>
      <dc:description>Alkynes are highly attractive motifs in organic synthesis due to their presence in natural products and bioactive molecules as well as their versatility in a plethora of subsequent transformations. A common procedure to insert alkynes into hetero(arenes), such as the thiophenes studied herein, consists of a halogenation followed by a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling. The regioselectivity of this approach depends entirely on the halogenation step. Similarly, direct alkynylations of thiophenes have been described that follow the same regioselectivity patterns. Herein we report the development of a palladium catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/alkynylation of thiophenes. The method is applicable to a broad range of thiophene substrates. For 3&#8208;substituted substrates where controlling the regioselectivity between the C2 and C5 position is particularly challenging, two sets of reaction conditions enable a regiodivergent reaction, giving access to each regioisomer selectively. Both protocols use the thiophene as limiting reagent and show a broad scope, rendering our method suitable for late&#8208;stage modification.</dc:description>

      <title>Flow Photochemistry for Single&#8208;Chain Polymer Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Single chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNP) constitute an attractive polymer architecture that potentially provides functions exclusively seen in folded biomacromolecules. The generation of SCNPs, however, is limited by the requirement of a high dilution chemical step, necessitating the use of large reactors in order to produce reasonable quantities of material.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNP) constitute an attractive polymer architecture that potentially provides functions exclusively seen in folded biomacromolecules. The generation of SCNPs, however, is limited by the requirement of a high dilution chemical step, necessitating the use of large reactors in order to produce reasonable quantities of material.

      <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be designed and constructed for powerful biomedical applications. Recent progress and future expectations are discussed in this Review.







Abstract
Porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives have been widely explored for various applications owing to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties. However, inherent shortcomings, such as instability and self&#8208;quenching under physiological conditions, limit their biomedical applications. In recent years, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing attention. The construction of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs by introducing porphyrin molecules into MOFs or using porphyrins as organic linkers to form MOFs can combine the unique features of porphyrins and MOFs as well as overcome the limitations of porphyrins. This Review summarizes important synthesis strategies for porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs including porphyrin@MOFs, porphyrinic MOFs, and composite porphyrinic MOFs, and highlights recent achievements and progress in the development of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs for biomedical applications in tumor therapy and biosensing. Finally, the challenges and prospects presented by this class of emerging materials for biomedical applications are discussed.

      <title>Large polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane cages &#8211; the isolation of functionalized POSS with an unprecedented Si18O27 core</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of organo&#8209;functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS, (R&#8209;SiO1.5)n, Tn) is currently an area of significant activity. To date, T14 is the largest such cage synthesized and isolated as a single isomer. Herein, we report the successful synthesis and isolation of an unprecedented, single&#8208;isomer styryl&#8209;functionalized T18 POSS. Unambiguously identified among nine possible isomers by multinuclear solution NMR (1H, 13C and 29Si), MALDI&#8208;MS, FTIR and computational studies, this represents the largest single&#8209;isomer functionalized Tn compound isolated to date.

&#160;A ring strain model was developed to correlate the 29Si resonances with the number of six&#8209;, five&#8209; and/or four&#8209;Si&#8209;atom rings that each non&#8209;equivalent Si atom is part of. The model successfully predicts the speciation of non&#8209;equivalent Si atoms in other families of Tn compounds, demonstrating its general applicability for assigning 29Si resonances to silicon atoms in cage silsesquioxanes and providing a useful tool for predicting silicon&#8208;atom environments.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) have attracted considerable interest owing to their broad utility. OMCs reported to date comprise amorphous rod&#8208;like or tubular or graphitic rod&#8208;like frameworks, which exhibit a tradeoff between conductivity and surface area.

OMGCs simultaneously realize high electrical conductivity and a large surface area and pore volume. Benefitting from these features, Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported on OMGC exhibit superior catalytic activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and single&#8208;cell performance for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis to Ru NPs on other OMCs and commercial catalysts.

      <title>Anisotropic Seeded Growth of Ag Nanoplates Confined in Shape&#8208;Deformable Spaces</title>
      <dc:description>Conventional templating synthesis confines the growth of seeds in rigid spaces to achieve faithful morphological replication. Herein, we explore the use of spherical shape&#8208;deformable polymeric nanoshells to regulate the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates. The flexible shells deform adaptively to accommodate the initial overgrowth of the seeds but restrict the growth in the directions where the shells are fully stretched, eventually producing nanoplates with an unconventional circular profile. The diameter of the final Ag nanoplates can be precisely predicted by stretching and flattering the nanoshells into a plate&#8208;like capsule while retaining their original internal surface area. Further, unlike conventional templates, the polymer shells eventually turn themselves into a conformal coating that binds to the surface of the full&#8208;grown Ag nanoplates and significantly enhances their stability against oxidative etching. We believe the unique feature of adaptive regulation offered by the deformable templates may provide many new opportunities for creating novel nanostructures while still maintaining the typical advantages of templating synthesis such as high uniformity, robustness, and scalability.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;switched reversible emulsification and demulsification of oil&#8208;in&#8208;water Pickering emulsions</title>
      <dc:description>Pickering emulsions have been shown to be an excellent platform for interfacial catalysis. However, developing simple and efficient strategies to achieve the goal of product separation and catalyst and emulsifier recovery is still a challenge. Herein, we report for the first time the switchable transition between emulsification and demulsification triggered by UV and visible light in a novel class of light&#8208;responsive Pickering emulsions fabricated from Pd supported silica nanoparticles, azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant, n&#8208;octane and water. It is shown that light&#8208;switchable emulsification and demulsification of the Pickering emulsions is attributed to the adsorption of azobenzene ionic liquid surfactant on the surface of the nanoparticles and the light switched surface activity of the ionic liquid surfactant. This feature enables the Pickering emulsion to be used as an easily controlled micro&#8208;reactor with the functions of catalytic reaction, product separation as well as emulsifier and catalyst recycling. As an example, highly efficient catalytic hydrogenation of some unsaturated hydrocarbons at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has been performed in this system, with product separation and emulsifier and catalyst re&#8208;use achievable in a simple way.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallographic analysis of NifB with a full complement of clusters: Structural insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion during nitrogenase cofactor assembly</title>
      <dc:description>NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of  Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum  NifB without (apo  Mt  NifB) and with (holo  Mt  NifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo  Mt  NifB contain a partial TIM barrel core; yet, unlike apo  Mt  NifB that is structurally disordered outside the TIM barrel, holo  Mt  NifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. Of the three [Fe4S4] clusters in holo  Mt  NifB, the canonical radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster, like those in other radical SAM enzymes, is coordinated by three Cys ligands; whereas the adjacently positioned K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys ligands. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with  in silico  docking of SAM in holo  Mt  NifB, suggests plausible binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein, we report arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones as a novel class of photoswitchable serine hydrolase inhibitors and present a chemoproteomic platform for rapid discovery of optically controlled serine hydrolase targets in complex proteomes. Specifically, we identify highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes carboxylesterases 1 and 2 and demonstrate the pharmacological application of our compounds by optically controlling the metabolism of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil. Collectively, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study provides a first example of photopharmacological tools to optically control drug metabolism by modulating the activity of a metabolizing enzyme. Our arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones offer synthetically accessible scaffolds that can be expanded to a larger library with hundreds of compounds to identify specific photoswitchable inhibitors for other serine hydrolases, including lipases, peptidases, and proteases and our chemoproteomic platform can be expanded to other photoswitches and scaffolds to achieve optical control over diverse protein classes.</dc:description>

      <title>Tethering Flexible Polymers to Crystalline Porous Materials: A Win&#8208;Win Hybridization Approach</title>
      <dc:description>Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied over the past few decades due to their well&#8208;defined, customizable, and porous structures. However, the limited stability and machinability restrict their particle applications. Recently, a new trend to use hybrid strategies to bridge the gap between CPMs and flexible polymers has emerged as an effective solution to tackle the above issues.

      <title>Does Molecular Catalyst Selectivity Change with Time? Polymerization Imaged via Single&#8208;Molecule Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The chemoselectivity of molecular catalysts underpins much of modern synthetic organic chemistry.&#160;&#160;Yet little is known about the selectivity of individual catalysts because this single&#8208;catalyst&#8208;level behavior is hidden by the bulk catalytic behavior. Here, for the first time, the selectivity of individual molecular catalysts for two different reactions is imaged in real time at the single&#8208;catalyst level.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The chemoselectivity of molecular catalysts underpins much of modern synthetic organic chemistry.&#160;&#160;Yet little is known about the selectivity of individual catalysts because this single&#8208;catalyst&#8208;level behavior is hidden by the bulk catalytic behavior. Here, for the first time, the selectivity of individual molecular catalysts for two different reactions is imaged in real time at the single&#8208;catalyst level. This imaging is achieved through fluorescence microscopy paired with spectral probes that produce a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the instantaneous chemoselectivity of a single catalyst for either a single&#8208;chain&#8208;elongation or a single&#8208;chain&#8208;termination event during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed polymerization. Superresolution imaging of multiple selectivity events, each at a different single&#8208;molecular ruthenium catalyst, indicates that catalyst selectivity may be unexpectedly spatial&#8208; and time&#8208;variable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>MicroED Elucidation of Diverse Solid&#8208;State Packing in a Family of Electron&#8208;Deficient Expanded Helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state packing plays a defining role in the properties of a molecular organic material, but it is difficult to elucidate in the absence of single crystals that are suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction. Here, we demonstrate the coupling of divergent synthesis with microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for rapid assessment of solid&#8208;state packing motifs, using a class of chiral nanocarbons &#8211; expanded helicenes &#8211; as a proof of concept. Two highly selective oxidative dearomatizations of a readily&#8208;accessible helicene provided a divergent route to four electron&#8208;deficient analogues containing quinone or quinoxaline units. Crystallization efforts consistently yielded microcrystals that were unsuitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, but ideal for MicroED. This technique facilitated the elucidation of solid&#8208;state structures of all five compounds with &lt;1.1 &#197; resolution. The otherwise&#8208;inaccessible data revealed a range of notable packing behavior, including four different space groups, homochirality in a crystal for a helicene with an extremely low enantiomerization barrier, and nanometer scale cavities. The results of this study suggest that MicroED will soon become an indispensable tool for high&#8208;throughput investigations in pursuit of next&#8208;generation organic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Synergistic Interplay of Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Reactive Polymer Nanoassembly Facilitates Intracellular Delivery of Antibodies</title>
      <dc:description>Utility of antibody as a therapeutic is by far limited to extracellular or membrane bound proteins, even though these molecules can be engineered to recognize many &#8220;undruggable&#8221; therapeutic targets. The primary impediments in developing large antibodies as drugs against intracellular targets involve their low transfection efficiency and suitable reversible encapsulation strategies for intracellular delivery with retention of biological activity. To address this, we outline an electrostatics&#8208;enhanced covalent self&#8208;assembly strategy to generate polymer&#8208;protein/antibody nanoassemblies. Through structure&#8208;activity studies, we down&#8208;select the best performing self&#8208;immolative pentafluorophenyl containing activated carbonate polymer for bioconjugation. With the help of an electrostatics&#8208;aided covalent self&#8208;assembly approach, we demonstrate efficient encapsulation of medium to large proteins (HRP, 44 kDa and&#160;&#946;&#8208;gal, 465 kDa)&#160;and antibodies (~150 kDa).

      <title>Electro&#8208;active pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence polymer based on a donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry</title>
      <dc:description>Amorphous polymers showing pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have emerged as an attractive alternative to crystalline small molecular phosphors due to their ease of film preparation and compatibility with flexible electronics. However, the current reported RTP polymers are electrically insulating, and unable to be used to fabricate practical optoelectronic devices that require charge transporting capability to some degree. Here we demonstrate an electro&#8208;active RTP polymer based on a characteristic donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry. Compared with the donor&#8208;acceptor reference, the inserted oxygen atom between donor and acceptor can not only decrease hole&#8208;electron orbital overlap to suppress the charge transfer fluorescence, but also strengthen spin&#8208;orbital coupling effect to facilitate the intersystem crossing and subsequent phosphorescence channels. As a result , a significant RTP is observed in solid states under photo excitation. Most noticeably, the corresponding polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) reveal a dominant electrophosphorescence with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 9.7%. The performance goes well beyond the 5% theoretical limit for typical fluors, opening a new door to the development of pure organic RTP polymers towards efficient PLEDs .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A novel synthetic strategy toward reversible cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials with tunable fluorescence properties is presented. Dimaleimide&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (TPE&#8208;2MI), which is non&#8208;emissive due to the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (PET) between maleimide (MI) and tetraphenylethene (TPE) groups, was used to cross&#8208;link random copolymers of methyl (MM), decyl (DM) or lauryl (LM) with furfuryl methacrylate (FM). The mixture of copolymer and TPE&#8208;2MI in DMF showed reversible fluorescence with &#8220;on/off&#8221; behavior depending on the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA)/retro&#8208;DA process, which is easily adjusted by temperature. At high temperatures, the retro&#8208;DA reaction of polymer networks is dominant, and the fluorescence is quenched by the PET mechanism. In contrast, at low temperatures, the emission recovers as the DA reaction takes over. Based on these results, a transparent PMFM/TPE&#8208;2MI film was prepared, and the emission behavior was investigated. It was found that the polymer film shows an accurate response to the external temperature and exhibited tunable fluorescent &#8220;turn on/off&#8221; behavior.

      <title>Enantioselective Protonation through Hydrophosphinylation of 1,1&#8208;Vinyl Azaheterocycle N&#8208;Oxides Catalyzed by Chiral Bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane as Higher Order Organosuperbase</title>
      <dc:description>An enantioselective protonation through a novel hydrophosphinylation reaction of diarylphosphine oxides with 2&#8208;vinyl azaheterocycle  N  &#8208;oxide derivatives was demonstrated using chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane as the higher order organosuperbase catalyst. It was confirmed on the basis of several control experiments that a chiral weak conjugate acid of the chiral bis(guanidino)iminophosphorane, instead of achiral diarylphosphine oxides, directly functioned as the proton source to afford the corresponding product in a highly enantioselective manner in most cases. The present enantioselective protonation by a weak conjugate acid generated from the higher order organosuperbase would broaden the scope of enantioselective reaction systems because of the utilization of a range of less acidic pronucleophiles. This methodology is highlighted by the valuable synthesis of a series of chiral P,N&#8208;ligands for chiral metal complexes through the reduction of phosphine oxide and  N  &#8208;oxide units of the corresponding product without loss of enantiomeric purity.</dc:description>

      <title>In Vivo Uranium Antidotal Therapy by a Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Internal uranium contamination as a consequence of uranium mining, nuclear incident, and nuclear terrorist attacks is one of the most significant concerns in society today. The most effective strategies for dealing with this issue, if it arises, is to develop new materials that can rapidly capture and remove the uranium from the body. However, current selections of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art antidotal agents suffer from clear drawbacks dealing with limited uranium capture capability, poor selectivity, and/or high toxicity. Here, we propose a new agent for actinide antidotal therapy with fast uranium uptake kinetics and efficient in vivo uranium removal by a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic framework (nano&#8208;MOF). UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles post&#8208;synthetically functionalized with carboxyl groups, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)  4  &#8208;180, exhibit the fastest uranium uptake kinetics reported with more than 65% of uranyl in fetal bovine serum (FBS) removed within 5 min. Moreover, the in vivo bio&#8208;distribution studies show that the material accumulates in kidneys and femurs where uranium mainly deposits facilitating the in vivo removal of uranium. The results of the in vivo uranium removal assays with mice show that UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)  4  &#8208;180 could successfully reduce the amounts of uranyl deposited in kidneys and femurs by up to 55.4% and 36.5%, respectively, and is significantly more efficient than the commercial actinide decorporation agent, ZnNa  3  &#8208;DTPA.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A chromium&#8208;catalyzed dimerization/hydroboration of allenes is developed to access synthetically versatile boryl&#8208;functionalized skipped dienes with a catalyst generated in situ from CrCl  2  and a pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diimine ligand  mes  PDI . A variety of allenes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford the corresponding boryl&#8208;functionalized (  E  ,  Z  )&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes in high yields and with excellent selectivity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies suggest that this chromium&#8208;catalyzed reaction probably proceeds through a chromium(I) hydride intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electric&#8208;Field Mediated Electron Tunneling of Supramolecular Naphthalimide Nanostructures for Biomimetic H2 Production</title>
      <dc:description>This work reported on the smart design and synthesis of two   novel semiconducting  bis  (4&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;bridging 1, 8&#8208;naphthalimide) bolaamphiphiles (BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  and BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  ) to fabricate supramolecular metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) nanostructures  for biomimetic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. An impressive H  2  evolution rate of  ca.  3.12 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  and an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of  ca.  1.63 % at 400 nm were achieved over the BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  &#8208;NH  3  +  &#8208;Ni MIS photosystem prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  with the opposite&#8208;charged  DuBois  &#8208;Ni catalysts.  The hot electrons of photoexcited BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  nanofibers were tunnelled to the molecular Ni collectors across a salt bridge and  an alkyl region of 2.2&#8208;2.5 nm length at a rate of 6.10&#215;10  8  s  &#8208;1  , which is five&#8208;times larger than the BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  nanoribbons (1.17&#215;10  8  s  &#8208;1  ). The transient spectral studies revealed that  the electric field benefited significantly the electron tunneling dynamics and  compensated the charge&#8208;separated states insufficient in the BENI&#8208;COO  &#8208;  nanofibers, consequently a comparable hydrogen evolution rate to the inverse BENI&#8208;NH  3  +  &#8208;COO  &#8208;  &#8208;Ni photosystem.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed sp  2  carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#8211;N) formation is a reliable method with which to synthesize aryl amines. Catalytic sp  3  C&#8211;N formation reactions have been reported occasionally, and methods which can realize both sp  2  and sp  3  C&#8211;N formation are relatively unexplored. Here we address this challenge with a method of catalytic decarboxylative C&#8211;N formation which proceeds through a cascade carboxylic acid activation, acyl azide formation, Curtius rearrangement and nucleophilic addition reaction. The reaction uses naturally abundant organic carboxylic acids as carbon sources, readily prepared azidoformates as the nitrogen sources, and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and Cu(OAc)  2  as catalysts with as low as 0.1 mol% loading, providing protected alkyl, alkenyl and aryl amines in high yields with gaseous N  2  and CO  2  as the only byproducts.

      <title>An Extrinsic&#8208;Pore&#8208;Containing Molecular Sieve Film: A Robust, High&#8208;Throughput Membrane Filter</title>
      <dc:description>MFI type zeolites with 10 membered&#8208;ring pores (~0.55 nm) have the ability to separate p&#8208;xylene (~0.58 nm) from its bulkier isomers. Here, we introduced non&#8208;zeolitic micropores (ca. 0.6&#8208;1.5 nm) and mesopores (ca. 2&#8208;7 nm) to a conventional microporous MFI type zeolite membrane, yielding an unprecedented Swiss cheese&#8208;like hierarchical membrane structure. Specifically, the self&#8208;pillaring twinned MFI growth around MEL cores during secondary growth was key for creating these additional, non&#8208;zeolitic pores. The uniform, embedded non&#8208;zeolitic pores allowed for reducing defect formation considerably and facilitating molecular transport, resulting in high p&#8208;xylene perm&#8208;selectivity and molar flux. Specifically, compared to a conventional, crack network&#8208;containing MFI membranes of similar thickness (~1 &#181;m), the mesoporous MFI membranes showed almost double p&#8208;xylene permeance (~1.6 &#177; 0.4 &#215; 10&#8208;7 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1&#183;Pa&#8208;1) and a high p&#8208;/o&#8208;xylene separation factor (~53.8 &#177; 7.3 vs. 3.5 &#177; 0.5 in the conventional MFI membrane) at 225 &#176;C. Crucially, the embedded non&#8208;zeolitic pores allowed for decreasing the separation performance degradation, which was apparently related to coke formation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MFI type zeolites with 10 membered&#8208;ring pores (~0.55 nm) have the ability to separate p&#8208;xylene (~0.58 nm) from its bulkier isomers. Here, we introduced non&#8208;zeolitic micropores (ca. 0.6&#8208;1.5 nm) and mesopores (ca. 2&#8208;7 nm) to a conventional microporous MFI type zeolite membrane, yielding an unprecedented Swiss cheese&#8208;like hierarchical membrane structure. Specifically, the self&#8208;pillaring twinned MFI growth around MEL cores during secondary growth was key for creating these additional, non&#8208;zeolitic pores. The uniform, embedded non&#8208;zeolitic pores allowed for reducing defect formation considerably and facilitating molecular transport, resulting in high p&#8208;xylene perm&#8208;selectivity and molar flux. Specifically, compared to a conventional, crack network&#8208;containing MFI membranes of similar thickness (~1 &#181;m), the mesoporous MFI membranes showed almost double p&#8208;xylene permeance (~1.6 &#177; 0.4 &#215; 10&#8208;7 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1&#183;Pa&#8208;1) and a high p&#8208;/o&#8208;xylene separation factor (~53.8 &#177; 7.3 vs. 3.5 &#177; 0.5 in the conventional MFI membrane) at 225 &#176;C. Crucially, the embedded non&#8208;zeolitic pores allowed for decreasing the separation performance degradation, which was apparently related to coke formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Reactivity, Selectivity and Synthesis of 4&#8208;C&#8208;Silylated Glycosyl Donors and 4&#8208;Deoxy Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>A method for introducing dimethylphenylsilyl at the 4&#8209;position in carbohydrates has been developed. Two C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors were prepared via levoglucosenone, starting from cellulose. The glycosylation properties were studied using three glucoside acceptors, a 3&#8208;OH, 4&#8208;OH and 6&#8208;OH. Compared with the 4&#8209;deoxy variant, it was found that the anomeric selectivity was influenced more by the C&#8208;2 substituents orientation than the silyl in the 4&#8208;position. In general, the reactivity of these donors was higher than the corresponding 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;analogue, albeit a competition experiment showed that the introduction of a C&#8208;Si increases the relative reactivity by a modest factor of around two.</dc:description>

      <title>Series of Crystals with Giant Optical Anisotropy: A Targeted Strategic Research</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence, as a key optical characteristic in polaized light, takes a vital role in optical communication, polarizing microscopic observation, and laser phase&#8208;matching. Currently, the main commercially used birefringent oxides &#945;&#8208;BaB2O  4  and YVO4  have the birefringences of 0.12 and 0.22, respectively. With the development of optical technology, more strict requirements for enhancing birefringence of oxides have been emerging. In this work, we propose a targeted high&#8208;throughput screening system to search birefringence&#8208;active functional modules (FMs) and large birefringent materials. A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C2O4]2&#8208;  , [C2O6]2&#8208;  , [C4O4]2&#8208;  , and [C6O6]2&#8208;  units are discovered to be novel birefringence&#8208;active FMs. Increasing optical anisotropy appears in order of [CO3]2&#8208;  , [C2O4]2&#8208;  , [C2O6]2&#8208;  , [C4O4]2&#8208;  , and [C6O6]2&#8208;  according to quantum chemistry calculations. The theoretical and experimental studies on the oxycarbides confirm the feasibility of strategy. Based on this, the oxycarbides ranging from deep&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared region with large birefringence from 0.1 to 1.35 are found, most of them break through the birefringent limit of oxides. And the largest one is 11 and 6 times of &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4  and YVO4  unprecedentedly. The (NH4)2C2O4  &#183;H2O crystal is grown and its experimental birefringence is 0.248 at 546 nm, which is identified as a promising UV birefringent crystal. In addition to newly found FMs, the A&#8208;site cations take significant roles in optical properties by influencing the density and arrangement of C&#8208;O units. The screened out compounds prove the validity of the FM&#8208;driven strategy, which would be a guide&#8208;line for exploring new birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

      <title>Ligand&#8208;dependent activity engineering of glutathione peroxidase&#8208;mimicking MIL&#8208;47(V) metal&#8211;organic framework nanozyme for therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) plays an important role in maintaining the reactive oxygen metabolic balance, yet limited GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are currently available for  in vivo  therapy. Herein, a ligand engineering strategy is developed to modulate the GPx&#8208;mimicking activity of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanozyme. With different substituted ligands, the GPx&#8208;mimicking activities of MIL&#8208;47(V)&#8208;X (X = F, Br, NH  2  , CH  3  , OH, and H) MOFs are rationally regulated. With the best one as an example, both  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments reveal the excellent antioxidation ability of MIL&#8208;47(V)&#8208;NH  2  , which alleviates inflammatory response effectively for both ear injury and colitis, better than less&#8208;active MIL&#8208;47(V). This study proves that high&#8208;performance GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozymes can be rationally designed by a ligand engineering strategy, and that structure&#8208;activity relationships can direct the  in vivo  therapy. Therefore, it not only enriches the research of nanozymes, but also expands the range of the biomimetic MOFs and knowledge&#8208;enabled nanomedicine.</dc:description>

Therefore, it not only enriches the research of nanozymes, but also expands the range of the biomimetic MOFs and knowledge&#8208;enabled nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>DNA Origami Templated Growth of Multilamellar Lipid Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>Lipids are important building blocks in cellular compartments and their supramolecular self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical structures has gained major interest. Cationic lipids and unstructured DNA can co&#8208;assemble into highly ordered structures (lipoplexes), but potential applications of lipoplexes are still rather limited. Using scaffolded DNA origami nanostructures could aid in resolving these drawbacks. Here, we have complexed DNA origami together with a cationic lipid 1,2&#8208;dioleoly&#8208;3&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;propane (DOTAP) and studied their self&#8208;assembly driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The results suggest that the DNA origami function as a template for the growth of multilamellar lipid structures and that the DNA origami are embedded in the formed lipid matrix. Furthermore, the lipid encapsulation was found to significantly shield the DNA origami against nuclease digestion. The presented complexation strategy is suitable for a wide range of DNA&#8208;based templates and could therefore find uses in construction of cell&#8208;membrane associated components.</dc:description>
