         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS) Assay for Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the development of a method for the electrochemical ultrasensitive detection of antibodies that couples the programmability and versatility of DNA&#8208;based systems with the sensitivity provided by enzymatic amplification. The platform, termed Enzyme&#8208;Linked DNA Displacement (ELIDIS), is based on the use of antigen&#8208;DNA conjugates that, upon the bivalent binding of a specific target antibody, induce the release of an enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand from a preformed duplex. Such enzyme&#8208;DNA hybrid strand can then be electrochemically detected with a disposable electrode with high sensitivity. We applied ELIDIS to demonstrate the sensitive (limit of detection in the low picomolar range), specific and multiplexed detection of five different antibodies including three clinically relevant ones. ELIDIS is also rapid (it only requires two reaction steps), works well in complex media (serum) and is cost&#8208;effective. A direct comparison with a commercial ELISA kit for the detection of Cetuximab demonstrates the promising features of ELIDIS as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care platform for antibodies detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Oxyanion Self&#8208;Transformation on NiFe Oxalates Enables Long&#8208;Term Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Seawater Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater electrolysis is an attractive way of making H2 in coastal areas, and NiFe&#8208;based materials are among the top options for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). However, ample Cl&#8722; in seawater can severely corrode catalytic sites and lead to limited lifespans. Herein, we report that in&#8208;situ carbon oxyanion self&#8208;transformation (COST) from oxalate to carbonate on a monolithic NiFe oxalate micropillar electrode allows safeguard of high&#8208;valence metal reaction sites in ASO. In&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ studies show that spontaneous, timely, and appropriate COST safeguards active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during ASO even at an ampere&#8208;level current density (j). Our NiFe catalyst shows efficient and stable ASO performance, which requires an overpotential as low as 349 mV to attain a j of 1 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the NiFe catalyst with protective surface CO32&#8722; exhibits a slight activity degradation after 600 h of electrolysis under 1 A cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. This work reports effective catalyst surface design concepts at the level of oxyanion self&#8208;transformation, acting as a momentous step toward defending active sites in seawater&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Well&#8211;defined N3C1&#8211;anchored Single&#8211;Metal&#8211;Sites for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8211;, C&#8211;, O&#8211;, S&#8211;coordinated single&#8211;metal&#8211;sites (SMSs) have garnered significant attention due to the potential for significantly enhanced catalytic capabilities resulting from charge redistribution. Nevertheless, substantial challenges persist in the precise design of well&#8211;defined such SMSs, and the fundamental comprehension has long been impeded in case&#8211;by&#8211;case reports by using carbon materials as investigation targets.&#160;&#160;In this work, the well&#8211;defined molecular catalysts with N3C1&#8211;anchored SMSs, i.e., N&#8211;confused metalloporphyrin (NCPor&#8211;Ms), are calculated for their catalytic oxygen reduction activity. Then, NCPor&#8211;Ms with corresponding N4&#8211;anchored SMSs (metalloporphyrin, Por&#8211;Ms), are synthesized for catalytic activity evaluation. Among all, NCPor&#8211;Co reaches the top in established volcano plots. NCPor&#8211;Co also shows the highest half&#8211;wave potential of 0.83 V vs. RHE in alkaline medium, which is much better than that of Por&#8211;Co (0.77 V vs. RHE). High&#8211;valence Co(III) and lower bandgap are responsible to the easier capturing intermediate *OOH for NCPor&#8211;Co in comparison with Por&#8211;Co. Moreover, the d&#8211;band center regulation contributes to the high activity of NCPor&#8211;Co.&#160;This study delves into the examination of well&#8211;defined asymmetric SMS molecular catalysts, encompassing both theoretical and experimental facets. It serves as a pioneering step towards enhancing the fundamental comprehension and facilitating the development of high&#8211;performance asymmetric SMS catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Chemo&#8208; and Biocatalytic Route to 16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids: Asymmetric Synthesis of Betamethasone Dipropionate, Clobetasol Propionate, and Beclomethasone Dipropionate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids are among the most important glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of various dermatological disorders, respiratory infections, and other allergic reactions elicited during inflammatory responses of the human body. Betamethasone dipropionate, clobetasol propionate, and beclomethasone dipropionate are particularly noteworthy for their synthetic intractability. Despite five decades of research, these 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids have remained challenging synthetic targets owing to insurmountable issues of reactivity, selectivity, and cost efficiency associated with all previously explored strategies. We herein report our practicability&#8208;oriented strategy toward the unified stereoselective synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids in 12.6&#8208;14.0% overall yield from commercially available 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxyandrost&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3,17&#8208;dione (9&#945;&#8208;OH&#8208;AD). In this approach, the chiral C16&#946;&#8208;Me and C17&#945;&#8208;OH groups of the corticosteroid D ring were installed via a substrate&#8208;controlled diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8211;reduction hydration of &#916;4,9(11),16&#8208;triene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The C1&#8211;C2 double bond of the corticosteroid A ring was constructed using an unprecedented engineered 3&#8208;ketosteroid&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (MK4&#8208;KstD)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation of &#916;4,9(11)&#8208;diene&#8208;3,21&#8208;dione. This strategy provides a general method and a key precursor for the divergent synthesis of a variety of glucocorticoids and related steroidal drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;assembly of Alanine&#8208;Tyramine Conjugates into Versatile, Uniform, Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Organic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) protocol that converts alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates into highly uniform enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocontainers by the action of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the aqueous medium under ambient conditions. The NP formation was possible with both enantiomers of alanine, and the average diameter could be varied from 150 nm to 250 nm (with a 5&#8208;12% standard deviation of as&#8208;prepared samples) depending on the precursor concentration. About 60% of the added HRP enzyme was entrapped within the NPs and was subsequently utilized towards post&#8208;synthetic modification of the NPs with phenolic compounds such as tyramine or tannic acid. One&#8208;pot multi&#8208;enzyme entrapment of Glucose oxidase (GOx) and peroxidase (HRP) within the NPs was also achieved. These GOx&#8208;HRP loaded NPs allowed multimodal detection of glucose, including that present in human saliva, with a limit of detection (LoD) value of 740 nM through fluorimetry. The NPs exhibited good cytocompatibility and were stable to changes in pH (acidic to basic), temperature, ultrasonication, and even the presence of organic solvent (EtOH) to a certain extent since they are stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding,&#160;p&#8208;p&#160;and CH&#8208;p&#160;interactions. The proposed&#160;e&#8208;DISA&#160;protocol can be widely expanded through designing diversified enzyme&#8208;responsive precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electro&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalysis for the Oxidative Aminocarbonylation of Arylboronic Acids to Amides from CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct CO2 electroreduction to valuable chemicals is critical for carbon neutrality, while its main products are limited to simple C1/C2 compounds, and traditionally, the anodic O2 byproduct is not utilized. We herein report a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that fully utilizes both cathodic (i.e., CO) and anodic (i.e., O2) products during overall CO2 electrolysis to produce valuable organic amides from arylboronic acids and amines in a separate chemical reactor, following the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation mechanism. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)&#8208;incorporated silver and nickel hydroxide carbonate electrocatalysts were prepared for efficient coproduction of CO and O2 with Faradaic efficiencies of 99.3% and 100%, respectively. Systematic experiments, operando attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that HMT promotes *CO2 hydrogenation/*CO desorption for accelerated CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, and O2 inhibits reductive deactivation of the Pd(II) catalyst for enhanced oxidative aminocarbonylation, collectively leading to efficient synthesis of 10 organic amides with high yields of above 81%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic strategy for economically attractive CO2 conversion and amide synthesis, representing a new avenue to explore the full potential of CO2 utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Spin&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in a Chiro&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Iron Phthalocyanine Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic activity of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was highly increased by promoting the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on FePc axially coordinated by chiral&#8208;peptides (L and D enantiomers). By adjusting the peptides&#8242; handedness and length (chiral C number), the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR were optimized for developing highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
The chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect (CISS) is a breakthrough phenomenon that has revolutionized the field of electrocatalysis. We report the first study on the electron spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR, using iron phthalocyanine, FePc, a well&#8208;known molecular catalyst for this reaction. The FePc complex belongs to the non&#8208;precious catalysts group, whose active site, FeN4, emulates catalytic centers of biocatalysts such as Cytochrome c. This study presents an experimental platform involving FePc self&#8208;assembled to a gold electrode surface using chiral peptides (L and D enantiomers), i.e., chiro&#8208;self&#8208;assembled FePc systems (CSAFePc). The chiral peptides behave as spin filters axial ligands of the FePc. One of the main findings is that the peptides&#8242; handedness and length in CSAFePc can optimize the kinetics and thermodynamic factors governing ORR. Moreover, the D&#8208;enantiomer promotes the highest electrocatalytic activity of FePc for ORR, shifting the onset potential up to 1.01&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline medium, a potential close to the reversible potential of the O2/H2O couple. Therefore, this work has exciting implications for developing highly efficient and bioinspired catalysts, considering that, in biological organisms, biocatalysts that promote O2 reduction to water comprise L&#8208;enantiomers.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygenative Skeletal Rearrangement of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines Using H2O and O2 as Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxygenative skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (TH&#946;Cs) was developed under mild conditions enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The process involves a multistep sequence to enable the transformation of TH&#946;Cs to donaxanine&#8208;type heterocycles in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron oxidative oxygenation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The synthetic reactivity of 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline species was demonstrated by a unique multi&#8208;step bond cleavage and formation cascade. Using a readily available copper catalyst under open&#8208;air conditions, highly important yet synthetically difficult spiro[pyrrolidone&#8208;(3,1&#8208;benzoxazine)] products were obtained in a single operation. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of the natural products donaxanine and chimonamidine, as well as the 3&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;pyrroloindoline scaffold, in just one or two steps.

         <title>Photoredox Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalysed stereoconvergent Stille reaction is designed for the first time, allowing for the construction of a rich range of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity under exceptionally mild conditions. The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm in the realm of Stille reactions.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. Despite notable strides in the advancement of the Stille reaction, persistent challenges persist in hindering its greener evolution. These challenges encompass multiple facets, such as the high cost of precious metals and ligands, the demand for various additives, and the slow reaction rate. In comparison to the dominant palladium&#8208;catalysed Stille reactions, cost&#8208;effective nickel&#8208;catalysed systems lag behind, and enantioconvergent Stille reactions of racemic stannanes remain undeveloped. Herein, we present a pioneering instance of nickel&#8208;catalysed enantioconvergent Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions of racemic stannane reagents, resulting in the formation of C&#8722;C bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under exceptionally mild conditions (without additives and bases, ambient temperature).

         <title>Length&#8208;Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from S=0 (closed&#8208;shell bisanthene) to S=0 (open&#8208;shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from S=0 to S=1/2.







Abstract
Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;&#8208;electron state, which can be described as a spin&#8208;polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed&#8208;shell to an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4&#8197;meV and a charge transfer&#8208;induced doublet.

     alt="Length-Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 (closed-shell bisanthene) to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 (open-shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=1/2.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;-electron state, which can be described as a spin-polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond-resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed-shell to an antiferromagnetic open-shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4&#8197;meV and a charge transfer-induced doublet. Therefore, this study formulated a chemically tunable platform to explore size-dependent &#960; magnetism at the atomic scale, providing a framework for research in organic spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>0D Pyramid&#8208;intercalated 2D Bimetallic Halides with Tunable Electronic Structures and Enhanced Emission under Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a new unique family of hybrid layered bimetallic halides with Cd/Cu as the MII site and Sb as the MIII site within the layered structure, with intercalated SbCl5 pyramids. These materials exhibit tunable electronic properties and optical band gaps from 2 to 3&#8197;eV. Using pressure as an external stimulus, the photoluminescence of the Cd analog is largely enhanced by 11&#8197;times.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are emerging semiconductors as potential candidates for optoelectronics. The pursuit of hybridizing various dimensions of metal halides remains a desirable yet highly complex endeavor. By utilizing dimension engineering, a diverse array of new materials with intrinsically different electronic and optical properties has been developed. Here, we report a new family of 2D&#8208;0D hybrid bimetallic halides, (C6N2H14)2SbCdCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCd) and (C6N2H14)2SbCuCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCu). These compounds adopt a new layered structure, consisting of alternating 0D square pyramidal [SbCl5] and 2D inorganic layers sandwiched by organic layers. SbCd and SbCu have optical band gaps of 3.3 and 2.3&#8197;eV, respectively. These compounds exhibit weak photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature, and the PL gradually enhances with decreasing temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that SbCd and SbCu are direct gap semiconductors, where first&#8208;principles band gaps follow the experimental trend. Moreover, given the different pressure responses of 0D and 2D components, these materials exhibit highly tunable electronic structures during compression, where a remarkable 11&#8197;times enhancement in PL emission is observed for SbCd at 19&#8197;GPa. This work opens new avenues for designing new layered bimetallic halides and further manipulating their structures and optoelectronic properties via pressure.

         <title>A Phosphine&#8208;Amine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Staggered Stacking Structure for Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional COF crystallizes via a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines, featuring an opposite staggered stacking of the interlocked dual layer in a unit cell. Post&#8208;quaternization on phosphazene moieties leads to the exfoliation of the staggered stacking COF into the few&#8208;layer ionized nanosheets, which can decouple lithium salts for rapid solid&#8208;state ion transport.







Abstract
In&#8208;plane ionic conduction over two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials is desirable for flexible electronics. Exfoliating 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards a few layers is highly anticipated, whereas most examples remain robust via &#960;&#8208;stacking against the interlayered dislocation. Herein, we synthesize a phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked 2D COF by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines. The synthesized COF is crystalline, and stacks in an AB&#8208;staggered fashion, wherein the AB dual layers are interlocked by embedding P&#8722;Cl bonds from one to another layer, and the non&#8208;interlocked layers are readily delaminated. Therefore, in situ post&#8208;quaternization over phosphazene can improve the ionization of backbones, accompanied by layered exfoliation. The ultrathin nanosheets can decouple lithium salts for fast solid&#8208;state ion transport, achieving a high conductivity and low activation energy. Our findings explore the P&#8722;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptides Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;terminal&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide has been shown to proceed by multistep structural evolution involving spheres, right&#8208;handed helices and microribbons .A bipyridine derivative was introduced at different stoichiometric ratios to obtain thermodynamically stable chiral nanostructures (right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed helices). Ultrasound and enzyme catalysis are also effective strategies to regulate the chirality.







Abstract
Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, the N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform, which showed that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate into the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted into microribbons. Interestingly, a bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broadens the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>Importing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy through Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd Bridge Promotes Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth oxides via an RE metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;mediated strategy to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR.







Abstract
The active&#8208;site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Pd&#8722;based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to their application in industrial energy devices. This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth (RE) oxides (Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and CeO2) by using RE metal&#8211;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8722;RExOy interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd2O3. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 VRHE), half&#8208;wave potential (0.877&#8197;VRHE), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm2O3/C, Pd&#8722;Eu2O3/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO2/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR. The pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd2O3 is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.

Taking Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;), half-wave potential (0.877&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C, Pd&#8722;Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding-orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate-determining step of ORR. The pH-dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C exhibits superior performance in Zn-air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Photo&#8208;Responsive Diphenylacetylene Enables PET In&#8208;Situ Upcycling with Reverse Enhanced UV&#8208;Resistance and Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the oligomer&#8208;scale, this work implements a novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for PET plastic wastes through tailored diphenylacetylene monomer. Uniquely, the dual photo&#8208;responses of diphenylacetylene enable upcycled PET plastics with reverse enhanced UV&#8208;resistance and strength.







Abstract
A novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for plastic waste is proposed by the customized diphenylacetylene monomer with dual photo&#8208;response. That is, diphenylacetylene reactive monomers are in situ inserted into the macromolecular chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics/fibers through one&#8208;pot transesterification of slight&#8208;depolymerization and re&#8208;polymerization. On the one hand, the diphenylacetylene group absorbs short&#8208;wave high&#8208;energy UV rays and then releases long&#8208;wave low&#8208;energy harmless fluorescence. On the other hand, the UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction among diphenylacetylene groups produces extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in a red&#8208;shift (due to decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO separation) in the UV absorption band and locked crosslink points between PET chains. Therefore, with increasing UV exposure time, the upcycled PET plastics exhibit reverse enhanced UV resistance and mechanical strength (superior to original performance), instead of serious UV&#8208;photodegradation and damaged performance. This upcycling strategy at oligomer&#8208;scale not only provides a new idea for traditional plastic recycling, but also solves the common problem of gradual degradation of polymer performance during use.

         <title>Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intersection of surfactant partitioning, spontaneous emulsification, and substrate wettability generates a unique type of motion&#8212;droplet oscillation&#8212;rarely reported in the literature for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion systems. The effect of varying the concentration of the surfactant, substrate properties, and the chemical nature of the oil and surfactant on the oscillating droplets was studied.







Abstract
The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self&#8208;powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side&#8208;view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self&#8208;emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact&#8208;line. The ability to control and understand droplet oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and adaptive materials.

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structural and valence state evolutions ranging from the initial Mn3.0&#8208;N4 to Mn3.8&#8208;N3C, followed by Mn3.2&#8208;N2C2, and ultimately returning to Mn3.0&#8208;N4 have been detected for Mn SAS during ORR by operando synchrotron radiation. The evolved configurations can regulate O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to promote ORR activity.







Abstract
Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8208;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8208;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8208;N4 into Mn&#8208;N3C and further into Mn&#8208;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8208;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8208;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8208;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99&#8197;V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether was achieved by using single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including internal and terminal alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. Detailed mechanistic studies pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid assisted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.







Abstract
The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8722;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.

         <title>Exploring Peptido&#8208;Nanocomposites in the Context of Amyloid Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review concerns the design principles, working mechanisms and application of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites against amyloidosis, a hallmark of amyloid diseases.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides are a major class of pharmaceutical drugs owing to their target&#8208;binding specificity as well as their versatility in inhibiting aberrant protein&#8208;protein interactions associated with human pathologies. Within the realm of amyloid diseases, the use of peptides and peptidomimetics tailor&#8208;designed to overcome amyloidogenesis has been an active research endeavor since the late 90s. In more recent years, incorporating nanoparticles for enhancing the biocirculation and delivery of peptide drugs has emerged as a frontier in nanomedicine, and nanoparticles have further demonstrated a potency against amyloid aggregation and cellular inflammation to rival strategies employing small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. Despite these efforts, however, a fundamental understanding of the chemistry, characteristics and function of peptido&#8208;nanocomposites is lacking, and a systematic analysis of such strategy for combating a range of amyloid pathogeneses is missing. Here we review the history, principles and evolving chemistry of constructing peptido&#8208;nanocomposites from bottom up and discuss their future application against amyloid diseases that debilitate a significant portion of the global population.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Hydroacylations under Heterogeneous Chiral Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts were developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective hydroacylations. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's without the leaching of Rh. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and, in sequential&#8208;flow reactions, the flow syntheses of value&#8208;added chemicals were demonstrated.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H bond functionalizations have become efficient methods for the synthesis of complex optically active molecules. Heterogeneous catalysts for this chemistry remain largely unexplored despite the advantages they offer in terms of ease of separation and reuse of catalysts. Herein, we report the development of heterogeneous chiral Rh catalysts for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective hydroacylations. Heterogeneous catalysts could be prepared simply by mixing supports and Rh complexes. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent activity and enantioselectivity affording optically active ketones in quantitative yields with 99&#8201;% ee's. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a turnover number &gt;300 was achieved without the leaching of Rh species. The catalysts exhibited a wide substrate scope and in sequential&#8208;flow reactions with other heterogeneous catalysts, the syntheses of biologically active molecules and functional materials were demonstrated.

         <title>Organic Excitonic State Management by Surface Metallic Coupling of Inorganic Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to manipulate the electronic energy states of organic phosphors by coupling with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals NaGdF4 is reported. The metallic atoms introduce strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects to organic chromophores. The result demonstrates the ability of charge transfer mechanism to broaden the utility of organic phosphors.







Abstract
The ability to harness charges and spins for control of organic excitonic states is critical in developing high&#8208;performance organic luminophores and optoelectronic devices. Here we report a facile strategy to efficiently manipulate the electronic energy states of various organic phosphors by coupling them with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals. We show that the metallic atoms exposed on the nanocrystal surface can introduce strong coupling effects to 9&#8208;(4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (OCzT) and some organic chromophores with carbazole functional groups when the organics are approaching the nanocrystals. This unconventional organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization enables a nearly 100&#8201;% conversion of the singlet excitation to fast charge transfer luminescence that does not exist in pristine organics, which broadens the utility of organic phosphors in hybrid systems.

         <title>Adjustable Plane Curvature of Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Outstanding Dielectric, Electret, and High&#8208;Temperature Processing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, the microstructure, dielectric, and electret properties of the covalent organic framework films are modulated by adjusting the ratio of 4,4&#8208;diamino biphenyl and 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenylmethane. The resulting films present excellent dielectric properties (ultralow dielectric constant (1.9), ultralow dielectric loss (0.0052) at 200&#8201;&#176;C) and are very promising for use in electronic devices serving in high&#8208;temperature environments.







Abstract
With the rapid development of integrated circuits towards miniaturization and complexity, there is an urgent need for materials with low dielectric constant/loss and high processing temperatures to effectively prevent signal delay and crosstalk. With high porosity, thermal stability, and easy structural modulation, covalent organic frameworks have great potential in the field of low dielectric materials. However, the optimization of dielectric properties by modulating the conjugated/plane curvature structure of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has rarely been reported. Accordingly, we herein innovatively prepare COF films with adjustable planar curvature, hence possessing ultralow dielectric constant (1.9 at 1&#8197;kHz), ultralow dielectric loss at 1&#8197;kHz (0.0029 at room temperature, 0.0052 at 200&#8201;&#176;C), high thermal decomposition temperature (5&#8201;% weight loss temperature, 473&#8201;&#176;C) and good hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 105.3&#176;). Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that the resulting COF film enables high surface potential (&#8776;320&#8197;V) for one week, attributing to its intrinsic high porosity, thus presenting great potential in electret applications. Accordingly, this innovative work provides a readily available and scalable idea to prepare materials with comprehensively excellent dielectric and electret properties as well as high processing temperatures simultaneously for advanced electronic device applications.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Macroscopic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry is usually employed for joining components at microscopic level, but unable for connecting macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize flexible manufacturing of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, of significance on parallel manufacturing. Herein, macroscopic click chemistry is achieved using hydrogels as macroscopic building blocks.







Abstract
The click reaction has found good utility across various fields due to the characteristics of high efficiency, atom economy, simple and mild reaction conditions. Click chemistry is usually utilized for connecting components of microscopic level, while it is still unable for joining macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels G1 and G2 were prepared by incorporating M1 (N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) and P1 (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion&#8208;induced amino&#8208;yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain&#8208;like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

         <title>Crystallization Regulation by Self&#8208;Assembling Liquid Crystal Template Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) was developed to modify buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSC). The ILC promotes a preferential growth of perovskite along [001] direction and exhibits strong interaction with perovskite to passivate defects. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers an efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.







Abstract
It is found that the disordered growth of bottom perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material to modify the buried interface for regulating the crystal growth and defect passivation is an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here, we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction, while the oriented ILC with mesomorphic phase has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect, as a result, the modified buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Sulfonylation of Yne&#8208;Allylic Esters with Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction was developed for the sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. Salient features of this practical method include readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Impressive progress has been made in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric propargylic substitution (APS) reaction, but its use in remote asymmetric yne&#8208;allylic substitution remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report the first remote enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. The reaction is assumed to occur via a copper&#8208;vinylvinylidene species as the key reactive intermediate. The use of readily available starting materials, the mild reaction conditions, and the excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), show the practicality and attractiveness of this method.

         <title>Azide Ionic Liquids for Safe, Green, and Highly&#8208;Efficient Azidation Reactions to Produce Azide Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;containing materials are widely applied in numerous fields, but always require undesired harsh synthetic conditions. This work establishes a safe, green, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide&#8208;containing materials by designing two novel azide ionic liquids, which can function as both reagents and solvents for highly efficient azidation reactions.







Abstract
Azide compounds are widely used and especially, polymers bearing pendant azide groups are highly desired in numerous fields. However, harsh reaction conditions are always mandatory to achieve full azidation, causing severe side reactions and degradation of the polymers. Herein, we report the design and preparation of two azide ionic liquids (AILs) with azide anion and triethylene glycol (E3)&#8208;containing cation, [P444E3][N3] and [MIME3][N3]. Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN3) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional&#8208;group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E3 moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.

         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal nanoparticles are constructed by ambient in situ &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation reduction and form strong interfacial coupling with defect&#8208;rich carriers through M&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds, accelerating electron transfer. The activated catalytic sites combined with oxygen vacancies lower the energy barrier and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, resulting in an outstanding performance for GOR and HER.







Abstract
Developing novel synthesis technologies is crucial to expanding bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. Herein, we report an ambient and controllable &#947;&#8208;ray radiation reduction to synthesize a series of noble metal nanoparticles anchored on defect&#8208;rich manganese oxides (M@MnO2&#8208;x, M=Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) for glycerol&#8208;assisted H2 evolution. Benefiting from the strong penetrability of &#947;&#8208;rays, nanoparticles and defect supports are formed simultaneously and bridged by metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, guaranteeing structural stability and active site exposure. The special Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds activate the Ru and Mn sites in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x through strong interfacial coordination, driving glycerol electrolysis at low overpotential. Furthermore, only a low cell voltage of 1.68&#8197;V is required to achieve 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer system along with excellent stability. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals that the strong interfacial coordination in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x balances the competitive adsorption of glycerol and OH* on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the defect&#8208;rich MnO2 support promotes the dissociation of H2O, while the defect&#8208;regulated Ru sites promote deprotonation and hydrogen desorption, synergistically enhancing glycerol&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron Regulating Electronic Structure of Iron Atom Clusters for Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst, comprised of oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms and atom clusters anchored onto bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon, was successfully fabricated. This material exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 production and allowed for coupling by an electro&#8208;Fenton process, primarily owing to the active sites of Fe atom clusters with optimized electronic structure regulated by Fe single atoms, resulting in the suitable binding strength of the *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
The integration of highly active single atoms (SAs) and atom clusters (ACs) into an electrocatalyst is critically important for high&#8208;efficiency two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report a tandem impregnation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy to fabricate the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs and ACs anchored on bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (BCC) (FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC). As the electrocatalyst, FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward 2e&#8722; ORR, affording an onset potential of 0.78&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 96.5&#8201;% in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. In a flow cell reactor, the FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC also achieves high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production with a yield rate of 12.51&#177;0.18&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 89.4&#8201;%&#177;1.3&#8201;% at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the feasibility of coupling the produced H2O2 and electro&#8208;Fenton process for the valorization of ethylene glycol was explored in detail. The theoretical calculations uncover that the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs effectively regulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs which are the 2e&#8722; ORR active sites, resulting in the optimal binding strength of *OOH intermediate for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <title>Spiky Artificial Peroxidases with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Pair Sites for Combating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for efficient and selective ROS&#8208;catalysis has been reported. We demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; bifunction from the spiky morphology and massive ROS (&#8901;OH and HClO) production, which efficiently eliminate MRSA and accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity.







Abstract
With the sharp rise of antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens worldwide, it is of enormous importance to create new strategies for combating pathogenic bacteria. Here, we create an iron oxide&#8208;based spiky artificial peroxidase (POD) with V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites (V&#8208;Fe2O3) for combating methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The experimental studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can achieve the localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; bifunction from the spiky morphology and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The V&#8208;Fe2O3 can reach nearly 100&#8201;% bacterial inhibition over a long period by efficiently oxidizing the lipid membrane. Our wound disinfection results identify that the V&#8208;Fe2O3 can not only efficiently eliminate MRSA and their biofilm but also accelerate wound recovery without causing noticeable inflammation and toxicity. This work offers essential insights into the critical roles of V&#8722;O&#8722;Fe pair sites and localized &#8220;capture and killing&#8221; in biocatalytic disinfection and provides a promising pathway for the de novo design of efficient artificial peroxidases.

         <title>Tailored Zwitterionic Hemicyanine Reporters for Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Assessment of Acute Renal Failure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable reporter ZCRR is developed by masking zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanine with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8. Systematic administration of ZCRR enables sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise prediction of renoprotective therapeutic effects through in vitro optical urinalysis.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced renal failure (DIRF) poses a serious medical complication with high mortality risk. However, early diagnosis or prognosis of DIRF remain challenging, as current methods rely on detecting late&#8208;stage biomarkers. Herein we present a library of zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanines (ZCs) available for constructing activatable reporters to detect DIRF since its initial stage. Zwitterionic properties of these probes are achieved through interspersedly integrating alkyl sulfonates and quaternary ammonium cations onto hemicyanine skeleton, which result in record low plasma protein binding (&lt;5&#8201;%) and remarkable renal clearance efficiencies (&#8776;96&#8201;%). An activatable reporter ZCRR is further developed by masking the optimal candidate ZC6 with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8, an initiating indicator of apoptosis. In living mice with cisplatin&#8208;induced DIRF, systematically administered ZCRR efficiently accumulates in kidneys and responds to elevated caspase&#8208;8 for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217;, enabling sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise evaluation of apoptosis remediation effects by different medications on DIRF mice. As it's urinary excretable, ZCRR also allows for remote detection of DIRF and predicting renoprotective efficacy through in vitro optical urinalysis. This study thus presents unimolecular renal clearable scaffolds that are applicable to developing versatile activatable reporters for renal diseases management.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinment of a spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene guest (BCNMC) in a cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) host has led to a light&#8208;driven multicolor luminescent supramolecular shuttle, which exhibits reversible conversion of the topological morphology. Alternating irradiation with visible light and the absence of light results in different fluorescence colors for information encryption.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on the doping of dyes or a photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange by simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by the macrocyclic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8211;guest complex displayed enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in the dark within 2&#8197;hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30&#8197;s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of the spiropyran moiety to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction is a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle as a result of intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8211;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the spiropyran supramolecular shuttle confined in the macrocyclic host CB[8] not only modulated a reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption.

         <title>Disulfide Click Reaction for Stapling of S&#8208;terminal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of disulfide linkers was established for Cys&#8722;Cys&#8722;(Cys) double/triple click stapling in only 1&#8197;min, bridging from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to deliver 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered locked peptides. The opposite unstapling process proceeded smoothly, making the reversible cross&#8208;linking reagents potentially suitable for peptide delivery.







Abstract
A disulfide click strategy is disclosed for stapling to enhance the metabolic stability and cellular permeability of therapeutic peptides. A 17&#8208;membered library of stapling reagents with adjustable lengths and angles was established for rapid double/triple click reactions, bridging S&#8208;terminal peptides from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to provide 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered macrocyclic peptides under biocompatible conditions. The constrained peptides exhibited enhanced anti&#8208;HCT&#8208;116 activity with a locked &#945;&#8208;helical conformation (IC50=6.81&#8197;&#956;M vs. biological incompetence for acyclic linear peptides), which could be unstapled for rehabilitation of the native peptides under the assistance of tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). This protocol assembles linear peptides into cyclic peptides controllably to retain the diverse three&#8208;dimensional conformations, enabling their cellular uptake followed by release of the disulfides for peptide delivery.

         <title>Promoting Syngas to Olefins with Isolated Internal Silanols&#8208;Enriched Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 Aluminosilicate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn2Al3O4 and Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C3&#8211;4= molecules.







Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value&#8208;added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (P/E) and olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with recently approved &#8722;ION structure, composed of 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (MR) extra&#8208;large lobed pores and intersected 10&#8208;MR medium pores, shows a C2&#8211;6= selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high O/P value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with ZnaAlbOx oxide. Moreover, for the high&#8208;silica Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=, resulting in high P/E (&gt;4) and butene/ethylene (B/E &gt;3) ratios. The high C3&#8211;4= selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 zeolite enhances the olefin&#8208;based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) and 1&#8208;hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 promote the desorption of C3&#8211;4=, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.

&lt;p&gt;The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Al-IDM-1 with 17-membered-ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective conversion of syngas to value-added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (&lt;i&gt;P/E&lt;/i&gt;) and olefin/paraffin (&lt;i&gt;O/P&lt;/i&gt;) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al-IDM-1 with recently approved &#8722;&lt;b&gt;ION&lt;/b&gt; structure, composed of 17-membered-ring (MR) extra-large lobed pores and intersected 10-MR medium pores, shows a C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high &lt;i&gt;O/P&lt;/i&gt; value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with Zn&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; oxide. Moreover, for the high-silica Al-IDM-1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in high &lt;i&gt;P/E&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;gt;4) and butene/ethylene (&lt;i&gt;B/E&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;3) ratios. The high C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al-IDM-1 zeolite enhances the olefin-based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol-to-propylene (MTP) and 1-hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al-IDM-1 promote the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;=&lt;/sup&gt;, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodized polyacrylonitrile anodes (I&#8208;PAN) can regulate the bulk/interphase metal&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and metal&#8208;ion desolvation chemistry of the electrolyte, and simultaneously reutilize the dead/plated metal. Benefiting from these features, the unprecedented extremely fast&#8208;charging performance can be achieved for a series of metal (Li, Na)&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN as anodes.







Abstract
The fast&#8208;charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I&#8208;PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li&#8208;ion desolvation process to realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I&#8208;PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self&#8208;induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6&#8722; not only promote the Li&#8208;ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Consequently, the I&#8208;PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (39&#8201;% of capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The I&#8208;PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000&#8197;cycles at extremely high rates of 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=180&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). We also demonstrate high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN anodes.

         <title>A Fast Na&#8208;Ion Conduction Polymer Electrolyte via Triangular Synergy Strategy for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast Na&#8208;ion conduction polymer electrolyte was designed through a triangular synergy strategy, which limits the migration of ionic liquid and facilitates the dissociation of salt, resulting in a faster Na+ conduction in the polymer electrolyte. The modified polymer electrolyte led to a salt&#8208;decomposition dominated interphase, which effectively suppressed gas evolution from ionic liquid decomposition, ensuring battery safety.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes provide a visible pathway for the construction of high&#8208;safety quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high interface compatibility and processability. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transfer at room temperature seriously limits their applications. Herein, a triangular synergy strategy is proposed to accelerate Na&#8208;ion conduction via the cooperation of polymer&#8208;salt, ionic liquid, and electron&#8208;rich additive. Especially, PVDF&#8208;HFP and NaTFSI salt acted as the framework to stably accommodate all the ingredients. An ionic liquid (Emim+&#8208;FSI&#8722;) softened the polymer chains through a weakening molecule force and offered additional liquid pathways for ion transport. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electron&#8208;rich Nerolin with &#960;&#8208;cation interaction facilitated the dissociation of NaTFSI and effectively restrained the competitive migration of large cations from EmimFSI, thus lowering the energy barrier for ion transport. The strategy resulted in a thin F&#8208;rich interphase dominated by NaTFSI salt's decomposition, enabling rapid Na+ transmission across the interface. These combined effects resulted in a polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (1.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and tNa+ (0.79) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled cells delivered reliable rate capability and stability (200 cycles, 99.2&#8201;%, 0.5&#8197;C) with a good safety performance.

         <title>Diadenosine Tetraphosphate (Ap4A) Serves as a 5&#8242; RNA Cap in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diadenosine tetraphosphate&#8208;RNA (Ap4A&#8208;RNA) is found in human and rat cell lines. Its amount is not dependent on the intracellular concentration of Ap4A. Ap4A&#8208;RNA is decapped by two enzymes, NUDT2 and DXO. Even though Ap4A&#8208;RNA is present in the same fraction as mRNA, it is not translated. However, it is recognized as self RNA by the innate immune system, as it does not elicit an immune response.







Abstract
The recent expansion of the field of RNA chemical modifications has changed our understanding of post&#8208;transcriptional gene regulation. Apart from internal nucleobase modifications, 7&#8208;methylguanosine was long thought to be the only eukaryotic RNA cap. However, the discovery of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps in eukaryotes revealed a new niche of previously undetected RNA chemical modifications. We are the first to report the existence of a new non&#8208;canonical RNA cap, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), in human and rat cell lines. Ap4A is the most abundant dinucleoside polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells and can be incorporated into RNA by RNA polymerases as a non&#8208;canonical initiating nucleotide (NCIN). Using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS), we show that the amount of capped Ap4A&#8208;RNA is independent of the cellular concentration of Ap4A. A decapping enzyme screen identifies two enzymes cleaving Ap4A&#8208;RNA,NUDT2 and DXO, both of which also cleave other substrate RNAs in vitro. We further assess the translatability and immunogenicity of Ap4A&#8208;RNA and show that although it is not translated, Ap4A&#8208;RNA is recognized as self by the cell and does not elicit an immune response, making it a natural component of the transcriptome. Our findings open a previously unexplored area of eukaryotic RNA regulation.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution through Local Field Distortion in Mg/Fe Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A regulation of the Fe spin state in a Mg&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst is realized by taking advantage of the local crystal field distortion induced by the large ionic radii difference between Fe/Mg. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting.







Abstract
Transition metal single atom electrocatalysts (SACs) with metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) configuration show great potential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the spin&#8208;dependent electrons must be allowed to transfer along reactants (OH&#8722;/H2O, singlet spin state) and products (O2, triplet spin state). Therefore, it is imperative to modulate the spin configuration in M&#8722;N&#8722;C to enhance the spin&#8208;sensitive OER energetics, which however remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a local field distortion induced intermediate to low spin transition by introducing a main&#8208;group element (Mg) into the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C architecture, and decode the underlying origin of the enhanced OER activity. We unveil that, the large ionic radii mismatch between Mg2+ and Fe2+ can cause a FeN4 in&#8208;plane square local field deformation, which triggers a favorable spin transition of Fe2+ from intermediate (dxy2dxz2dyz1dz21, 2.96 &#956;B) to low spin (dxy2dxz2dyz2, 0.95 &#956;B), and consequently regulate the thermodyna&#8208;mics of the elementary step with desired Gibbs free energies. The as&#8208;obtained Mg/Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst demonstrates a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the overall water splitting, which outperforms those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition metal SACs.

         <title>Maturation of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase: Direct Transfer of the (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)FeII(CN)(CO)2 Complex B from HydG to HydE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical SAM protein HydG uses L&#8208;tyrosine, L&#8208;cysteine and ferrous ion to produce complex B, which corresponds to a (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)Fe(CN)(CO)2, organometallic compound. Complex B is subsequently transferred through direct contacts to the radical SAM protein HydE for further processing en route to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster.







Abstract
[FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen. Their prowess stems from the intricate H&#8208;cluster, combining a [Fe4S4] center with a binuclear iron center ([2Fe]H). In the latter, each iron atom is coordinated by a CO and CN ligand, connected by a CO and an azadithiolate ligand. The synthesis of this active site involves a unique multiprotein assembly, featuring radical SAM proteins HydG and HydE. HydG initiates the transformation of L&#8208;tyrosine into cyanide and carbon monoxide to generate complex B, which is subsequently transferred to HydE to continue the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H&#8208;subcluster. Due to its instability, complex B isolation for structural or spectroscopic characterization has been elusive thus far. Nevertheless, the use of a biomimetic analogue of complex B allowed circumvention of the need for the HydG protein during in vitro functional investigations, implying a similar structure for complex B. Herein, we used the HydE protein as a nanocage to encapsulate and stabilize the complex B product generated by HydG. Using X&#8208;ray crystallography, we successfully determined its structure at 1.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrated that complex B is directly transferred from HydG to HydE, thus not being released into the solution post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting a transient interaction between the two proteins.

         <title>Generation of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Radicals for Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in hydroamination, amidosulfenylation and bromoamination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines serve as important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules. Experimental data on the mechanism are presented.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have been widely recognized as versatile synthetic intermediates for the construction of nitrogen containing molecules of high value. As such, there has been a long&#8208;standing interest in the field of organic synthesis to develop novel nitrogen&#8208;based radicals and explore their inherent reactivity. In this study, we present the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in a novel and diverse functionalization of unactivated alkenes. Bench&#8208;stable aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridinium salts were employed as crucial NCR precursors, which enabled the efficient conversion of various unactivated alkenes into medicinally relevant alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines. This approach offers an unexplored retrosynthetic disconnection for the synthesis of related molecules that commonly possess therapeutic value. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to the synthesis of densely functionalized heterocyclic amines by utilizing disulfides and diethyl bromomalonate as radical quenchers. Mechanistic investigations indicate an energy transfer (EnT) pathway involving the formation of a transient aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radical, radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and subsequent generation of the amination product through either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or radical addition processes.

         <title>Small Organic Molecular Electrocatalysts for Fuels Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Minireview, recent efforts to develop electrocatalytic systems consisting of small organic molecules employed for energy relevant reactions such as water oxidation, hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are highlighted.







Abstract
In recent years, heterocyclic organic compounds have been explored as molecular electrocatalysts in relevant reactions for energy conversion and storage. Merging mimetics of biological systems that perform hydride transfer with rational synthetic chemical design has opened many opportunities for organic molecules to be tuned at the atomic level conferring them interesting reactivities. These molecular electrocatalysts represent an alternative to traditional metallic materials and metal complexes employed for water oxidation, hydrogen production, and carbon dioxide reduction. This minireview describes recent reports concerning design, catalytic activity and the mechanism of synthetic molecular electrocatalysts towards solar fuels production.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely conjugated enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugates serve as stabilizers to form Pickering emulsions. In the aqueous phase, enzymes can be expressed in vitro and directly used to construct multiple&#8208;step reactions with the biocatalysts prepositioned on the emulsion droplet surface. This approach integrates the strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient solution for chemical synthesis by cascade biotransformations.







Abstract
In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8208;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from nonspecific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, while encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. The resulting cascade reaction system leveraged enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a fivefold enhancement in catalytic performance as compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.

         <title>Cesium Cyclopropane Acid&#8208;Aided Crystal Growth Enables Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Moisture Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites (iHPs) are promising photovoltaic materials, the associated water sensitivity of iHPs calls for stringent humidity control to reach satisfactory photovoltaic efficiencies. Herein, we report a moisture&#8208;insensitive perovskite formation route under ambient air for CsPbI2Br&#8208;based iHPs via cesium cyclopropane acids (C3) as a compound introducer. With this approach, appreciably enhanced crystallization quality and moisture tolerance of CsPbI2Br are attained. The improvements are attributed to the modified evaporation enthalpy of the volatile side product of DMA&#8208;acid initiated by Cs&#8208;acids. As such, the water&#8208;involving reaction is directed toward the DMA&#8208;acids, leaving the target CsPbI2Br perovskites insensitive to ambient humidity. We highlight that by controlling the C3 concentration, the dependence of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in CsPbI2Br devices on the humidity level during perovskite film formation becomes favorably weakened, with the PCEs remaining relatively high (&gt;15%) associated with improved device stability for RH levels changed from 25% to 65%. The champion solar cells yield an impressive PCE exceeding 17%, showing small degradations (&lt;10%) for 2000 hours of shell storage and 300 hours of 85/85 (temperature/humidity) tests. The demonstrated C3&#8208;based strategy provides an enabler for improving the long&#8208;sought moisture&#8208;stability of iHPs toward high photovoltaic device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rigid Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Core Toward Stable Electroluminescence and Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic laser devices with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is emerging due to the potential of harnessing triplets. In this work, a boron/nitrogen multiple&#8208;resonance TADF polycyclic framework fusing carbazole units (CzBNPh) was proposed. CzBNPh exhibited a narrowband emission (&lt;30 nm), a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and a fast radiative rate. Consequently, CzBNPh demonstrated a low distributed feedback (DFB) lasing threshold of 0.68 &#956;J cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the stimulated emission zone of CzBNPh was effectively separated from its singlet and triplet absorption, thereby minimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation under long&#8208;pulsed excitation ranging from 20 &#956;s to 2.5 ms. Significantly, the enhanced rigid molecular conformation, thermal stability, and photo&#8208;stability resulted in improved lasing and electroluminescence stability compared to that of 5,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (DABNA)&#8208;core. These findings indicate the potential of CzBN&#8208;core as a promising framework for achieving long&#8208;pulsed wave and electrically&#8208;pumped lasing in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Exchangeable Self&#8208;Assembled Lanthanide Antennas for PLIM Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanides have unique photoluminescence (PL) emission properties, including very long PL lifetimes. This makes them ideal for biological imaging applications, especially using PL lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). PLIM is an inherently multidimensional technique with exceptional advantages for quantitative biological imaging. Unfortunately, due to the required prolonged acquisitions times, photobleaching of lanthanide PL emission currently constitutes one of the main drawbacks of PLIM. In this study, we report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble, lanthanide antenna, 8&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;3phosphonic acid, PAnt, specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable dye aimed at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Thus, selfassembled lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during image acquisition are continuously replenished by intact lanthanide antennas from a large reservoir. Remarkably, our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of PL photobleaching when compared to well&#8208;established lanthanide cryptates, used for bioimaging. This concept of exchangeable lanthanide antennas opens new possibilities for quantitative PLIM bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous&#160;Elimination of Excess Photoinstable PbI2 and Interfacial Band Mismatch for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eliminating&#160;the undesired photoinstability of excess lead iodide (PbI2) in the perovskite film and reducing the energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and heterogeneous interfaces are urgent issues to be addressed in the preparation of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by two&#8208;step sequential deposition method. Here, the&#160;1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) is employed to convert superfluous PbI2 to more robust 1D EMIMPbI3 which can withstand&#160;lattice strain, while forming an interfacial dipole layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface to reconfigure the interfacial energy band structure and accelerate the charge extraction. Consequently,&#160;the unencapsulated PVSCs device attains a champion efficiency of 24.28% with one of the highest open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19 V).&#160;Moreover, the unencapsulated&#160;devices showcase significantly improved thermal stability, enhanced environmental stability and remarkable operational stability accompanied by 85% of primitive efficiency retained over 1500 h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd8 Nanocluster with Nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;Metallo&#8208;Aromatic&#8208;Ring Coordination and Promising Photothermal Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing ambient&#8208;stable, single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials with atomic precision and understanding their underlying stability mechanisms are challenging. Here, stable single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanoclusters of Pd were synthesized and precisely characterized through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A pseudo&#8208;pentalene&#8208;like Pd8 unit was found in the nanocluster, interacting with two syn PPh units through nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination. The unexpected coordination, which is distinctly different from the typical organo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring&#8208;to&#8208;metal coordination in half&#8208;sandwich&#8208;type organometallic compounds, contributes to the ambient stability of the as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered nanocluster as revealed through theoretical and experimental analyses. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations revealed dominant electron transition along the horizontal x&#8208;direction of the Pd8 plane, indicating high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the nanocluster, which was verified by the experimental PCE of 73.3%. Therefore, this study unveils the birth of a novel type of compound and the finding of the unusual nonmetal&#8208;to&#8208;metallo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;ring coordination and has important implications for future syntheses, structures, properties, and structure&#8211;property correlations of single&#8208;atom&#8208;layered metal&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>RAFT Polymerisation by the Radical Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled grafting of polymers from small&#8208; and macro&#8208;molecular substrates is an essential process for many advanced polymer applications. This usually requires the pre&#8208;functionalisation of substrates with an appropriate functional group, such as a RAFT agent or ATRP initiator, which requires additional synthetic steps. In this paper, we describe the direct grafting of RAFT polymers from carboxylate containing small molecules and polymers via photochemical radical decarboxylation. This method utilises the innate functional groups present in the substrates, and achieves efficient polymer initiation in a single step with excellent control of molecular weight and dispersity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic sp Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Polymers with Synergistic Multi&#8208;Active Groups for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green organic materials composed of C, H, O,&#160;and N elements are receiving more and more attention worldwide. However, the high solubility, poor electrical conductivity, and long activation time limit the development of organic materials in practice. Herein, two stable covalent organic materials with alkynyl linkage between benzene rings and benzothiadiazole groups with different amounts of fluorine atoms modification (defined as BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F), are designed for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Both BOP&#8208;0F and BOP&#8208;2F can achieve superior reversible capacities of ~719.8 and 713.5 mA h&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;over 100 cycles on account of the redox activity of alkynyl (two&#8208;electron involved) and benzothiadiazole units (five&#8208;electron involved) in these organic materials. While BOP&#8208;2F electrodes exhibit much more stable cycling performance than BOP&#8208;0F electrodes, especially without pronounced capacity ascending during initial cycling. It can be assigned to the synergy effect of alkynyl linkage and fluorine atom modification in BOP&#8208;2F. The lithium storage and activation mechanism&#160;of alkynyl, benzothiadiazole, and fluorine groups&#160;have also been deeply probed&#160;by a series of material characterizations&#160;and theoretical simulations.&#160;This work could be noteworthy in providing novel tactics for the molecular design and investigation of high&#8208;efficiency organic electrodes for energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Glucose Oxidase&#8208;Carbon Nanotube Conjugates for Tissue&#8208;Translatable Glucose Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous and non&#8208;invasive glucose monitoring and imaging is important for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. However, glucose monitoring remains a technical challenge owing to the dearth of tissue&#8208;transparent glucose sensors. In this study, we present the development of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors directly functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) capable of immediate and reversible glucose imaging in biological fluids and tissues. We prepared GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors by facile sonication of SWCNT with GOx in a manner that &#8211; surprisingly &#8211; does not compromise the ability of GOx to detect glucose. Importantly, we find by using denatured GOx that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the catalytic oxidation of glucose but rather triggered by glucose&#8208;GOx binding. Leveraging the unique response mechanism of GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors, we developed catalytically inactive apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT that enables both sensitive and reversible glucose imaging, exhibiting a &#916;F/F0 of up to 40 % within 1 s of exposure to glucose. We finally demonstrate the potential applicability of apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT in biomedical applications by glucose quantification in human plasma and glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrashort Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Oxyfluorides by Covalency Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals A5Ta3OF18 (A = K, Rb) were designed and synthesized by a newly developed de&#8208;covalency band gap engineering strategy. With the optimized combination of two types of 5d0&#8208;Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra, they simultaneously realized strong SHG efficiencies and record&#8208;short phase&#8208;matching wavelength.







Abstract
The development of urgently&#8208;needed ultraviolet (UV)/deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by contradictory requirements of the microstructure, in particular the need for a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response as well as a short phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength. We herein employ a &#8220;de&#8208;covalency&#8221; band gap engineering strategy to adjust the optical linearity and nonlinearity. This has been achieved by assembling two types of transition&#8208;metal (TM) polyhedra ([TaO2F4] and [TaF7]), affording the first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent NLO materials, A5Ta3OF18 (A = K (KTOF), Rb (RTOF)). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the highly ionic bonds and strong electropositivity of tantalum in the two oxyfluorides induce record short PM wavelengths (238 (KTOF) and 240 (RTOF) nm) for d0&#8208;TM&#8208;centered oxides, in addition to strong SHG responses (2.8 &#215; KH2PO4 (KTOF) and 2.6 &#215; KH2PO4 (RTOF)), and sufficient birefringences (0.092 (KTOF) and 0.085 (RTOF) at 546&#8197;nm). These results not only broaden the available strategies for achieving deep&#8208;UV NLO materials by exploiting the currently neglected d0&#8208;TMs, but also push the shortest PM wavelength into the short&#8208;wavelength UV region.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorus: Thiolate Exchange Cascades with Higher Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating disulfides and oligonucleotide phosphorothioates, dynamic covalent cascade exchange chemistry centered on phosphorus has been achieved using neutral higher phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates. They walk along Hammett gradients of thiolate exchangers in triton X&#8208;100 micelles, exchange with cysteine and glutathione in neutral water, and protect from thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce phosphorus, a pnictogen, as an exchange center for dynamic covalent chemistry. Cascade exchange of neutral phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates with thiolates is demonstrated in organic solvents, aqueous micellar systems, and in living cells. Exchange rates increase with the pH value, electrophilicity of the exchange center, and nucleophilicity of the exchangers. Molecular walking of the dynamic phosphorus center along Hammett gradients is simulated by the sequential addition of thiolate exchangers. Compared to phosphorotrithioates, tetrathioates are better electrophiles with higher exchange rates. Dynamic phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates are non&#8208;toxic to HeLa Kyoto cells and participate in the dynamic networks that account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Atropisomers Bearing Multiple Chiral Elements: An Emerging Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements has recently become an emerging research field. Chemists have devised metal&#8208;catalyzed or organocatalytic asymmetric reactions for accessing atropisomers with multiple chiral elements, such as those with center chirality, planar chirality, and helical chirality. This review summarizes the rapid developments in this field and indicated the remaining challenges.







Abstract
With the rapid development of asymmetric catalysis, the demand for the enantioselective synthesis of complex and diverse molecules with different chiral elements is increasing. Owing to the unique features of atropisomerism, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers has attracted a considerable interest from the chemical science community. In particular, introducing additional chiral elements, such as carbon centered chirality, heteroatomic chirality, planar chirality, and helical chirality, into atropisomers provides an opportunity to incorporate new properties into axially chiral compounds, thus expanding the potential applications of atropisomers. Thus, it is important to perform catalytic asymmetric transformations to synthesize atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. In spite of challenges in such transformations, in recent years, chemists have devised powerful strategies under asymmetric organocatalysis or metal catalysis, synthesizing a wide range of enantioenriched atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. Therefore, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements has become an emerging field. This review summarizes the rapid progress in this field and indicates challenges, thereby promoting this field to a new horizon.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically driven tandem chip integrated with magnetic nanomixers and cyclic SERS tags was developed to achieve streamlined rapid isolation and multiplexed profiling of EVs. Six protein markers were analysed simultaneously using only 10&#8197;&#956;L plasma within 1.5&#8197;h. The EV signature offers precise diagnosis of breast cancer patients.







Abstract
The protein phenotypes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, the technical challenges in rapid isolation and multiplexed molecular detection of EVs have limited their clinical practice. Herein, we developed a magnetically driven tandem chip to achieve streamlined rapid isolation and multiplexed profiling of surface protein biomarkers of EVs. Driven by magnetic force, the magnetic nanomixers not only act as tiny stir bars to promote mass transfer and enhance reaction efficiency of EVs, but also transport on communicating vessels of the tandem chip continuously and expedite the assay workflow. We designed cyclic surface enhancement of Raman scattering (SERS) tags to bind with target EVs and then release them by exonuclease I, eliminating steric hindrance and amplifying the SERS signal of multiple protein biomarkers on EVs. Due to the excellent assay performance, six breast cancer biomarkers were detected simultaneously on EVs using only 10&#8197;&#956;L plasma within 1.5&#8197;h. The unweighted SUM signature offers great accuracy in discriminating breast cancer patients from healthy donors. Overall, the dynamic magnetic driving tandem chip offers a new avenue to advance the clinical application of EV&#8208;based liquid biopsy.

         <title>How Acyl Carrier Proteins (ACPs) Direct Fatty Acid and Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Megasynthases are responsible for producing primary metabolites and complex natural products. The final products are built in a stepwise process in which small acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) play a central role as they shuttle the growing intermediates between the different catalytic domains. This Review provides an overview of the current understanding and proposes a mechanism for the programming of the ACP movement in megasynthases.







Abstract
Megasynthases, such as type&#8197;I fatty acid and polyketide synthases (FASs and PKSs), are multienzyme complexes responsible for producing primary metabolites and complex natural products. Fatty acids (FAs) and polyketides (PKs) are built by assembling and modifying small acyl moieties in a stepwise manner. A central aspect of FA and PK biosynthesis involves the shuttling of substrates between the domains of the multienzyme complex. This essential process is mediated by small acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). The ACPs must navigate to the different catalytic domains within the multienzyme complex in a particular order to guarantee the fidelity of the biosynthesis pathway. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ACP&#8208;mediated substrate shuttling, particularly the factors contributing to the programming of the ACP movement, still need to be fully understood. This Review illustrates the current understanding of substrate shuttling, including concepts of conformational and specificity control, and proposes a confined ACP movement within type&#8197;I megasynthases.

         <title>Visualizing the Structure, Composition and Activity of Single Catalyst Particles for Olefin Polymerization and Polyolefin Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of laboratory&#8208; and synchrotron&#8208;based chemical imaging techniques can be employed to study heterogeneous catalysts at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This review discusses related advances in the fields of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysis and highlights future research directions that can ultimately deliver more detailed insights into structure&#8208;performance relationships in relevant catalyst materials.







Abstract
The structural and morphological characterization of individual catalyst particles for olefin polymerization, as well as for the reverse process of polyolefin decomposition, can provide an improved understanding for how these catalyst materials operate under relevant reaction conditions. In this review, we discuss an emerging analytical toolbox of 2D and 3D chemical imaging techniques that is suitable for investigating the chemistry and reactivity of related catalyst systems. While synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray microscopy still provides unparalleled spatial resolutions in 2D and 3D, a number of laboratory&#8208;based techniques, most notably focused ion beam&#8208;scanning electron microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, infrared photoinduced force microscopy and laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;computed tomography, have helped to significantly expand the arsenal of analytical tools available to scientists in heterogeneous catalysis and polymer science. In terms of future research, the review outlines the role and impact of in situ and operando (spectro&#8722;)microscopy experiments, involving sophisticated reactors as well as online reactant and product analysis, to obtain real&#8208;time information on the formation, decomposition, and mobility of polymer phases within single catalyst particles. Furthermore, the potential of fluorescence microscopy, X&#8208;ray microscopy and optical microscopy is highlighted for the high&#8208;throughput characterization of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysts. By combining these chemical imaging techniques with, for example, chemical staining methodologies, selective probe molecules as well as particle sorting approaches, representative structure&#8211;activity relationships can be derived at the level of single catalyst particles.

         <title>Pre&#8208;intercalation of Ammonium Ions in Layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
&#948;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets with intercalated ammonium ions (AMO) are synthesized via a self&#8208;templated strategy as a Zn&#8208;ion battery cathode. The incorporation of ammonium ions enlarges the interlayer space and forms hydrogen bonds for enhanced structural robustness and fast reaction kinetics. As a result, the AMO cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and long lifespan in full cells.







Abstract
Layered manganese dioxide is a promising cathode candidate for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, inferior intrinsic electronic conductivity and poor structural stability still limit its practical application. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy to incorporate ammonium ions into manganese dioxide (named as AMO) nanosheets as a cathode for boosted Zn ion storage. K+&#8208;intercalated &#948;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets (KMO) grown on carbon cloth are chosen as the self&#8208;involved precursor. Of note, ammonium ions could replace K+ ions via a facile hydrothermal reaction to enlarge the lattice space and form hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Compared with KMO, the structural stability and the ion transfer kinetics of the layered AMO are enhanced. As expected, the obtained AMO cathode exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability over 10000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Directional Defect Management in Perovskites by In Situ Decom&#8208;position of Organic Metal Chalcogenides for Efficient Solar Cells</title>

A directional passivation strategy is reported using 2D Cu&#8208;(4&#8208;mercaptophenol) as a passivator precursor, which combines the benefits of both organic and inorganic passivators through targeted modification and excellent stability, respectfully.







Abstract
Directional defects management in polycrystalline perovskite film with inorganic passivator is highly demanded while yet realized for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a directional passivation strategy employing a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material, Cu&#8208;(4&#8208;mercaptophenol) (Cu&#8208;HBT), as a passivator precursor. Cu&#8208;HBT combines the merits of the targeted modification from organic passivator and excellent stability offered by inorganic passivator. Featuring with dense organic functional motifs on its surfaces, Cu&#8208;HBT has the capability to &#8220;find&#8221; and fasten to the Pb defect sites in perovskites through coordination interactions during a spin&#8208;coating process. During subsequent annealing treatment, the organic functional motifs cleave from Cu&#8208;HBT and convert in situ into p&#8208;type semiconductors, Cu2S and PbS. The resultant Cu2S and PbS not only serve as stable inorganic passivators on the perovskite surface, significantly enhancing cell stability, but also facilitate efficient charge extraction and transport, resulting in an impressive efficiency of up to 23.5&#8201;%. This work contributes a new defect management strategy by directionally yielding the stable inorganic passivators for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Enzymatic Upcycling of PET Waste to Calcium Terephthalate for Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study successfully demonstrates the one&#8208;pot biocatalysis&#8208;based production of calcium terephthalate from waste PET. The incorporation of Ca2+ during the production process not only enhanced the efficiency of enzymatic plastic depolymerization but also reduced the base consumption. Consequently, this approach has proven to be a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly method for upcycling PET into calcium terephthalate.







Abstract
Biotechnological recycling offers a promising solution to address the environmental concerns associated with waste plastics, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), widely utilized in packaging materials and textiles. To advance the development of a bio&#8208;based circular plastic economy, innovative upcycling strategies capable of generating higher&#8208;value products are needed. In this study, we enhanced the enzymatic depolymerization of waste PET by incorporating highly concentrated calcium ions (up to 1&#8197;m) to the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by the best currently known enzyme LCCICCG. The presence of calcium ions not only improved the thermal stability and activity of the biocatalyst but also significantly reduced the consumption of base required to maintain optimal pH levels. Employing optimized conditions at 80&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h, we successfully converted &#8776;84&#8201;% of the waste PET (200&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1) into solid hydrated calcium terephthalate (CaTP&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O) as the primary product instead of soluble terephthalate salt. CaTP&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O was easily purified and employed as a raw material for battery electrode production, exhibiting an initial reversible specific capacity of 164.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Through techno&#8208;economic analysis, we conclusively demonstrated that the one&#8208;pot biocatalysis&#8208;based synthesis of CaTP is a superior PET upcycling strategy than the secondary synthesis method employing recycled terephthalic acid.

An iron&#8208;catalyzed stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation reaction enables the highly effective synthesis of Z&#8208;allylsilanes from easily available E/Z mixtures of conjugated dienes.







Abstract
Stereoconvergent transformation of E/Z mixtures of olefins to products with a single steric configuration is of great practical importance but hard to achieve. Herein, we report an iron&#8208;catalyzed stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation reactions of E/Z mixtures of readily available conjugated dienes for the synthesis of Z&#8208;allylsilanes with high regioselectivity and exclusive stereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reactions most likely proceed through a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism. The stereoselectivity of the reactions is ultimately determined by the crowded reaction cavity of the &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand&#8208;modified iron catalyst, which forces the conjugated diene to coordinate with the iron center in a cis conformation, which in turn results in generation of an anti&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl iron intermediate. The mechanism of this stereoconvergent transformation differs from previously reported mechanisms of other related reactions involving radicals or metal&#8208;hydride species.

         <title>Cu3BiS3: Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Induces Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Phonon Scattering Enabling Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a groundbreaking discovery, thus highlighting the significant role of low&#8208;dimensional local coordination ([CuS3] D3h triangle plane) in lowering the thermal conductivity through characteristic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering, while also contributing to a large Gr&#252;neisen parameter. This allows Cu3BiS3 to exhibit one of the lowest &#954;lat values (0.32&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) reported so far.







Abstract
The discovery of compounds with low thermal conductivity and the understanding of their microscopic mechanisms are of great challenges and scientific significance. Herein, we report a unique ternary sulfide compound, Cu3BiS3, in which all Cu atoms are coordinated within a two&#8208;dimensional [CuS3] triangle plane. This local coordination leads to efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering and an ultralow thermal conductivity. Through DFT phonon spectrum calculations and analyses, we reveal that the lowest vibration frequency decreases from 2 THz for high&#8208;dimensional [CuS4] tetrahedral coordinated Cu atoms in CuBiS2 (CN=4, with an average Cu&#8722;S bond length of 2.328&#8197;&#197;) to 1.5 THz for low&#8208;dimensional [CuS3] triangular coordinated Cu atoms in Cu3BiS3 (CN=3, with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond length of 2.285&#8197;&#197;). This is due to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal vibration of the Cu atoms in the latter. Consequently,Cu3BiS3 exhibits one of the lowest values of &#954;lat (0.32&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) among its peer, with a 36&#8201;% reduction compared to CuBiS2 (0.50&#8197;W/m&#8201;K). This groundbreaking discovery highlights the significant role of 2D local coordination in reducing thermal conductivity through characteristic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering, while also contributing to a large Gr&#252;neisen parameter (2.06) in Cu3BiS3.

         <title>Locally Ordered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) exhibit remarkable potential in revolutionizing the limitations of SACs. To date, no review has comprehensively summarized this intriguing topic. This minireview focuses on the compelling characteristics, synthetic strategies, characterization methods, and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts manifest nearly 100&#8201;% atom utilization efficiency, well&#8208;defined active sites, and high selectivity. However, their practical applications are hindered by a low atom loading density, uncontrollable location, and ambiguous interaction with the support, thereby posing challenges to maximizing their electrocatalytic performance. To address these limitations, the ability to arrange randomly dispersed single atoms into locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) substantially influences the electronic effect between reactive sites and the support, the synergistic interaction among neighboring single atoms, the bonding energy of intermediates with reactive sites and the complexity of the mechanism. As such, it dramatically promotes reaction kinetics, reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, improves the performance of the catalyst and simplifies the reaction mechanism. In this review, firstly, we introduce a variety of compelling characteristics of LO&#8208;SACs as electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies, characterization methods and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are elaborated to encourage further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Complete Glucose Electrooxidation Enabled by Coordinatively Unsaturated Copper Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose typically occurs via a 2&#8208;electron process, hampering practical applications. This study introduces a novel Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;hydroxide organic framework, enabling complete glucose oxidation to formate and carbonate, potentially releasing 24 electrons per glucose molecule. It holds substantial promise for sensors, energy conversion and biomass upscaling.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose plays a vital role in biomass conversion, renewable energy, and biosensors, but significant challenges remain to achieve high selectivity and high activity simultaneously. In this study, we present a novel approach for achieving complete glucose electrooxidation utilizing Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MHOF) featuring coordinatively unsaturated Cu active sites. In contrast to traditional Cu(OH)2 catalysts, the Cu&#8208;MHOF exhibits a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation, enabling exclusive oxidation of glucose into formate and carbonate as the final products. The critical role of open metal sites in enhancing the adsorption affinity of glucose and key intermediates was confirmed by control experiments and density functional theory simulations. Subsequently, a miniaturized nonenzymatic glucose sensor was developed showing superior performance with a high sensitivity of 214.7&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a wide detection range from 0.1&#8197;&#956;M to 22&#8197;mM, and a low detection limit of 0.086&#8197;&#956;M. Our work provides a novel molecule&#8208;level strategy for designing catalytically active sites and could inspire the development of novel metal&#8211;organic framework for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices.

In contrast to traditional Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts, the Cu-MHOF exhibits a remarkable 40-fold increase in electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation, enabling exclusive oxidation of glucose into formate and carbonate as the final products. The critical role of open metal sites in enhancing the adsorption affinity of glucose and key intermediates was confirmed by control experiments and density functional theory simulations. Subsequently, a miniaturized nonenzymatic glucose sensor was developed showing superior performance with a high sensitivity of 214.7&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a wide detection range from 0.1&#8197;&#956;M to 22&#8197;mM, and a low detection limit of 0.086&#8197;&#956;M. Our work provides a novel molecule-level strategy for designing catalytically active sites and could inspire the development of novel metal&#8211;organic framework for next-generation electrochemical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bent &#960;&#8208;Conjugation within a Macrocycle: Asymmetric Total Syntheses of Spirohexenolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles with bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation motif are extremely rare in nature and synthetically daunting and anticancer haouamines and spirohexenolides were representative of such rare natural products with synthetically challenging bent &#960;&#8208;conjugation within a macrocycle. While the total synthesis of haouamines has been elegantly achieved, spirohexenolides remains an unmet synthetic challenge due to the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within C15 macrocycle. Inspired by the chemical synthesis of cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) and haouamines, herein we devise a synthetic strategy to overcome the highly strained bent 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation within the macrocycle and achieve the first, asymmetric total synthesis of spirohexenolides A (&gt;20 mg) and B (&gt;50 mg). Our synthesis features strategic design of ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) macrocyclization followed by double dehydration to achieve the C15 macrocycle with the deformed nonplanar 1,3,5&#8208;triene conjugation. In addition, we have developed a new enantioselective construction of highly functionalized spirotetronate fragment (northeast moiety) through RCM and Ireland&#8722;Claisen rearrangement. Our in vitro bioassay studies reveal that both spirohexenolides are cytotoxic against a panel of human cancer cells with IC50 1.2&#8208;13.3 &#956;M and spirohexenolide A is consistently more potent (up to 3 times) than spirohexenolide B, suggesting the importance of alcohol for their bioactivity and for medicinal chemistry development.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented regiodivergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of aromatic alkenes has been developed.

Key to success for the control of the regioselectivity of the carbonylation step is the concentration of the acidic co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Leveraging the Proximity and Distribution of Cu&#8208;Cs Sites for Direct Conversion of Methanol to Esters/Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methanol serves as a versatile building&#8208;block for various commodity chemicals, and the development of industrially promising strategies for its conversion remains the ultimate goal in methanol chemistry.  In this study, we design a dual Cu&#8208;Cs catalytic system that enables a one&#8208;step direct conversion of methanol and methyl acetate/ethanol into high value&#8208;added esters/aldehydes, with customized chain length and saturation by leveraging the proximity and distribution of Cu&#8208;Cs sites. Cu&#8208;Cs at a millimeter&#8208;scale intimacy triggers methanol dehydrogenation and condensation, involving proton transfer, aldol formation, and aldol condensation, to obtain unsaturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 76.3% and 31.1%, respectively. Cu&#8208;Cs at a micrometer&#8208;scale intimacy significantly promotes mass transfer of intermediates across catalyst interfaces and their subsequent hydrogenation to saturated esters and aldehydes with selectivities of 67.6% and 93.1%, respectively. Conversely, Cu&#8208;Cs at a nanometer&#8208;scale intimacy alters reaction pathway with a similar energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step, but blocks the acidic&#8208;basic sites and diverts the reaction to byproducts. More importantly, an unprecedented quadruple tandem catalytic production of methyl methacrylate (MMA) is achieved by further tailoring Cu and Cs distribution across the reaction bed in the configuration of Cu&#8208;Cs||Cs, outperforming the existing industrial processes and saving at least 15% of production costs.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring of Metal Complexes on Au25 Nanocluster for Enhanced Photocoupled Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) with discrete energy levels can be used as photosensitizers for CO2 reduction. However, tight ligand capping of Au NCs hinders CO2 adsorption on its active sites. Here, a new hybrid material is obtained by anchoring of thiol functionalized terpyridine metal complexes (metal complexes, metal= Ru, Ni, Fe, Co) on Au NCs by ligand exchange reactions (LERs). The anchoring of Ru and Ni complexes on Au25 NC (Au25&#8208;Ru and Au25&#8208;Ni) leads to adequate CO2 to CO conversion for photocoupled, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (PECR) in terms of high selectivity, with Faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) exceeding 90% in a wide potential range, remarkable activity (CO production rate up to two times higher than that for pristine Au25PET18) and extremely large turnover frequencies (TOFs, 63012 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;0.97 V for Au25&#8208;Ru and 69989 h&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE for Au25&#8208;Ni). Moreover, PECR stability test indicates the excellent long&#8208;term stability of the modified NCs in contrast with pristine Au NCs. The present approach offers a novel strategy to enhance PECR activity and selectivity, as well as to improve the stability of Au NCs under light illumination, which paves the way for highly active and stable Au NCs catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;type oxides exhibit remarkable chemical stability in comparison to perovskite oxides. However, they display lower oxygen permeability. We present an approach to overcome this trade&#8208;off by leveraging the anisotropic properties of Nd2NiO4+&#948;. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field (0.81 T). A stable and high oxygen flux of 1.40 mL min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 was achieved for at least 120 h at 1223 K by a textured asymmetric disk membrane with 1.0 mm thickness under the pure CO2 sweeping. Its excellent operational stability was also verified even at 1023 K in pure CO2. These findings highlight the significant enhancement in oxygen permeation membrane performance achievable by adjusting the grain orientation. Consequently, Nd2NiO4+&#948; emerges as a promising candidate for industrial applications in air separation, syngas production, and CO2 capture under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy To Access Alternating Styrene/Substituted Styrene Copolymers by Using a Traceless Controlling Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical alternating copolymerization has been realized between &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester and diverse styrene co&#8208;monomers. Facile removal of the traceless boronyl controlling group further provides a unified access to a wide range of alternating polystyrenes that are non&#8208;trivial to obtain through conventional approaches.







Abstract
We herein report a synthetic strategy for alternating copolymers of styrene and substituted styrenes by utilizing &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester (StBpin) as the co&#8208;monomer through radical alternating copolymerization followed by protodeboronation. The excellent alternating polymerization behavior of the StBpin co&#8208;monomer in such a radical polymerization system is considered to be attributed to the steric hindrance and radical stabilization exerted by the Bpin group. This strategy is effective with a wide range of substituted styrene co&#8208;monomers regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents, and the protodeboronation of the alternating Bpin&#8208;containing polymers is highly efficient without polymer backbone alternation. RAFT living polymerization was also compatible with this approach. Thus, this strategy provides a way to build&#8208;up alternating copolymers consisting of similar styrene&#8208;type co&#8208;monomers, which has been inaccessible by conventional synthetic methods.

     alt="A General Strategy To Access Alternating Styrene/Substituted Styrene Copolymers by Using a Traceless Controlling Group"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A radical alternating copolymerization has been realized between &#945;-styryl boronate pinacol ester and diverse styrene co-monomers. Facile removal of the traceless boronyl controlling group further provides a unified access to a wide range of alternating polystyrenes that are non-trivial to obtain through conventional approaches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We herein report a synthetic strategy for alternating copolymers of styrene and substituted styrenes by utilizing &#945;-styryl boronate pinacol ester (&lt;b&gt;StBpin&lt;/b&gt;) as the co-monomer through radical alternating copolymerization followed by protodeboronation. The excellent alternating polymerization behavior of the &lt;b&gt;StBpin&lt;/b&gt; co-monomer in such a radical polymerization system is considered to be attributed to the steric hindrance and radical stabilization exerted by the Bpin group. This strategy is effective with a wide range of substituted styrene co-monomers regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents, and the protodeboronation of the alternating Bpin-containing polymers is highly efficient without polymer backbone alternation. RAFT living polymerization was also compatible with this approach. Thus, this strategy provides a way to build-up alternating copolymers consisting of similar styrene-type co-monomers, which has been inaccessible by conventional synthetic methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenative Deuteration of Halides over a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework MFM&#8208;300(Cr) acts as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) with high deuterium incorporation. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ EPR spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Deuterium labelling of organic compounds is an important process in chemistry. We report the first example of photocatalytic dehalogenative deuteration of both arylhalides and alkylhalides (40 substrates) over a metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;300(Cr), using CD3CN as the deuterium source at room temperature. MFM&#8208;300(Cr) catalyses high deuterium incorporation and shows excellent tolerance to various functional groups. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the activation of halogenated substrates via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). In situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy confirms the formation of carbon&#8208;based radicals as intermediates and reveals the reaction pathway. This protocol removes the use of precious&#8208;metal catalysts from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art processes based upon direct hydrogen isotope exchange and shows high photocatalytic stability, thus enabling multiple catalytic cycles.

         <title>Multiple Triplet Metal&#8208;Centered Jahn&#8208;Teller Isomers Determine Temperature&#8208;Dependent Luminescence Lifetimes in [Ru(bpy)3]2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ are in excellent agreement with experimental values only when multiple pathways involving Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers of the 3MC excited states are considered.







Abstract
Understanding the factors that determine the luminescence lifetime of transition metal compounds is key for applications in photocatalysis and photodynamic therapy. Here we show that for 
(bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), the generally accepted idea that emission lifetimes can be controlled optimizing the energy barrier from the emissive triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) state to the thermally&#8208;activated triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state or the energy gap between both states is a misconception. Further, we demonstrate that considering a single relaxation pathway determined from the minimum that is lowest in energy leads to wrong temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes predictions. Instead, we obtain excellent agreement with experimental temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes when an extended kinetic model that includes all the pathways related to multiple Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers and their effective reaction barriers is employed. These concepts are essential to correctly design other luminescent transition metal complexes with tailored emission lifetimes based on theoretical predictions.

         <title>Photoinduced [3+2] Cycloaddition of Carbenes and Nitriles: A Versatile Approach to Oxazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing singlet carbenes, we developed a versatile method for [3+2] cycloaddition with diverse nitriles to yield substituted oxazoles. Our approach can be extended to bis&#8208;oxazoles, isotope&#8208;labeled oxazoles, drug diversification, as well as natural product and drug synthesis. Integration of photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry demonstrated applicability, scalability, and robustness for oxazole synthesis.







Abstract
We have developed a photoinduced protocol for the synthesis of pharmaceutically important oxazole molecules using diazo&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;containing reactants. The process involves the initial photolysis of the diazo compound to afford singlet carbenes, which are tapped by nitriles in a [3+2] cycloaddition fashion to give substituted oxazoles. With di&#8208;nitrile compounds, useful bis&#8208;oxazoles were obtained. The applicability of the transformation is showcased through the expedient synthesis of small&#8208;molecule drugs and biologically relevant molecules such as felbinac, pimprinine, texamine, ugnenenazole etc. The protocol is also useful for the generation of 2H and 13C isotope labelled oxazoles. Merging photolysis with continuous&#8208;flow chemistry was demonstrated for scaling up the reaction. The non&#8208;requirement of metal catalysis or photosensitizers to harness the light energy with blue light sufficing the execution of the reaction makes it a versatile and general protocol for the synthesis of structurally diverse oxazoles

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Polymer for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion and Zinc Nitrate Batteries</title>

A universal molecular engineering strategy is developed to enhance electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene to modulate the electronic state of metal centers. The resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone shows a much higher ammonia FE of 97.7&#8201;% than copper 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (85.1&#8201;%). It can be also applied as the catalyst cathode for rechargeable Zn&#8208;nitrate battery.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based materials are promising single&#8208;site catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) on account of well&#8208;defined structures and functional tunability but still lack a molecular&#8208;level understanding for designing the high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Here, we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to enhance electrochemical NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (BTA) based metal&#8208;organic polymer to precisely modulate the electronic state of metal centers. Due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the carbonyl group, metal centers can be converted to an electron&#8208;deficient state, fascinating the NO3&#8722; adsorption and promoting continuous hydrogenation reactions to produce NH3. Compared to CuBTA with a low NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion efficiency of 85.1&#8201;%, quinone group functionalization endows the resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone (CuTABQ) distinguished performance with a much higher NH3 FE of 97.7&#8201;%. This molecular engineering strategy is also universal, as verified by the improved NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion performance on different metal centers, including Co and Ni. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery based on CuTABQ cathode can deliver a high power density of 12.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides advanced insights into the rational design of metal complex catalysts through the molecular&#8208;level regulation for NO3&#8722; electroreduction to value&#8208;added NH3.

         <title>Ultrafast Xanthate&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast photoiniferter polymerization was explored as a strategy to produce nano&#8208;objects via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. By leveraging the rapid photolysis of xanthates under UV light, micelles, worms, and vesicles could be produced within 5&#8197;min by varying core&#8208;chain length, concentration, or molar composition. Utilizing this technique, we developed a 25&#8197;g&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot method in which micelles were obtained within 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful technique for preparing block copolymer nanostructures. Recently, efforts have been focused on applying photochemistry to promote PISA due to the mild reaction conditions, low cost, and spatiotemporal control that light confers. Despite these advantages, chain&#8208;end degradation and long reaction times can mar the efficacy of this process. Herein, we demonstrate the use of ultrafast photoiniferter PISA to produce polymeric nanostructures. By exploiting the rapid photolysis of xanthates, near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion can be achieved within five minutes to prepare micelles, worms, and vesicles at various core&#8208;chain lengths, concentrations, or molar compositions.

         <title>Synthetic Matching of Complex Monoterpene Indole Alkaloid Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of monoterpene indole alkaloid natural products have been subjected to chemical evolution to afford a collection of pseudo&#8208;natural products. The novel structural classes match the unique chemical space that is highlighted by the high spatial complexity&#8208;density of the parent natural product class and are enriched with bioactivities inhibiting DNA synthesis and tubulin polymerization.







Abstract
Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are endowed with high structural and spatial complexity and characterized by diverse biological activities. Given this complexity&#8208;activity combination in MIAs, rapid and efficient access to chemical matter related to and with complexity similar to these alkaloids would be highly desirable, since such compound classes might display novel bioactivity. We describe the design and synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) collection obtained by the unprecedented combination of MIA fragments through complexity&#8208;generating transformations, resulting in arrangements not currently accessible by biosynthetic pathways. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that both the pseudo&#8208;NPs and the MIAs reside in a unique and common area of chemical space with high spatial complexity&#8208;density that is only sparsely populated by other natural products and drugs. Investigation of bioactivity guided by morphological profiling identified pseudo&#8208;NPs that inhibit DNA synthesis and modulate tubulin. These results demonstrate that the pseudo&#8208;NP collection occupies similar biologically relevant chemical space that Nature has endowed MIAs with.

         <title>Retrosynthetic Analysis Applied to Clip&#8208;off Chemistry: Synthesis of Four Rh(II)&#8208;Based Complexes as Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Clip&#8208;off Chemistry, a retrosynthetic analysis step based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds enables defining the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this new approach is used to synthesize four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.







Abstract
Clip&#8208;off Chemistry is a synthetic strategy that our group previously developed to obtain new molecules and materials through selective cleavage of bonds. Herein, we report recent work to expand Clip&#8208;off Chemistry by introducing into it a retrosynthetic analysis step that, based on virtual extension of the products through cleavable bonds, enables one to define the required precursor materials. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have validated our new approach by synthesising and characterising four aldehyde&#8208;functionalised Rh(II)&#8208;based complexes: a homoleptic cluster; a cis&#8208;disubstituted paddlewheel cluster; a macrocycle; and a crown.

         <title>Selective Four&#8208;Electron Reduction of Oxygen by a Nonheme Heterobimetallic CuFe Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully developed the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst, which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase. This catalyst demonstrates exceptional selectivity (96.0&#8201;%) and an impressive turnover frequency (2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1) in the reduction of O2 to water. These outstanding catalytic properties are attributed to the collaborative efforts of copper and iron, as they work together to efficiently break the O&#8722;O bond via the CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII intermediate.







Abstract
We report herein the first nonheme CuFe oxygen reduction catalyst ([CuII(bpbp)(&#956;&#8208;OAc)2FeIII]2+, CuFe&#8722;OAc), which serves as a functional model of cytochrome c oxidase and can catalyze oxygen reduction to water with a turnover frequency of 2.4&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1 and selectivity of 96.0&#8201;% in the presence of Et3NH+. This performance significantly outcompetes its homobimetallic analogues (2.7&#8197;s&#8722;1 of CuCu&#8722;OAc with %H2O2 selectivity of 98.9&#8201;%, and inactive of FeFe&#8722;OAc) under the same conditions. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies, in combination with density functional theory calculation, show that the CuFe center efficiently mediates O&#8722;O bond cleavage via a CuII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;O2)FeIII peroxo intermediate in which the peroxo ligand possesses distinctive coordinating and electronic character. Our work sheds light on the nature of Cu/Fe heterobimetallic cooperation in oxygen reduction catalysis and demonstrates the potential of this synergistic effect in the design of nonheme oxygen reduction catalysts.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Photocatalytic Decaging for Remote&#8208;Controlled Spatiotemporal Activation in Living Mice
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote&#8208;controlled manipulation of biological processes is meaningful but challenging. Herein we report the development of near infrared light photocatalytic decaging chemistry (CAT&#8208;NIR) for on&#8208;demand fluorescence activation and drug release in living cells. We also achieved protein rescue and in vivo prodrug activation by taking advantage of the decaging chemistry and the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of the NIR light.

Spatiotemporal manipulation of biological processes in living animals using noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled stimuli is a captivating but challenging endeavor. Herein, we present the development of a biocompatible photocatalytic technology termed CAT&#8208;NIR, which uses external near infrared light (NIR, 740&#8197;nm) to trigger decaging reactions in living mice. The Os(II) terpyridine complex was identified as an efficient NIR photocatalyst for promoting deboronative hydroxylation reactions via superoxide generation in the presence of NIR light, resulting in the deprotection of phenol groups and the release of bioactive molecules under living conditions. The validation of the CAT&#8208;NIR system was demonstrated through the NIR&#8208;triggered rescue of fluorophores, prodrugs as well as biomolecules ranging from amino acids, peptides to proteins. Furthermore, by combining genetic code expansion and computer&#8208;aided screening, CAT&#8208;NIR could regulate affibody binding to the cell surface receptor HER2, providing a selective cell tagging technology through external NIR light. In particular, the tissue&#8208;penetrating ability of NIR light allowed for facile prodrug activation in living mice, enabling noninvasive, remote&#8208;controlled rescue of drug molecules. Given its broad adaptability, this CAT&#8208;NIR system may open new opportunities for manipulating the functions of bioactive molecules in living animals using external NIR light with spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Synthesis of Complex Diarylamines through a Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization Strategy
</title>

Novel amino&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts were obtained through SNAr with o&#8208;fluoro&#8208;diaryliodonium salts. A sequential arylation/ring opening pathway with external nucleophiles allows for transition metal&#8208;free skeletal diversification of cyclic amines to provide a wide variety of complex diarylamines with high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy. The strategy proved efficient also in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
The diarylation and skeletal diversification of unstrained cyclic amines was exploited to expand and modify the favorable properties of this important substrate class with pivotal roles in drug discovery. Cyclic amines were employed in the synthesis of a novel class of amino&#8208;substituted diaryliodonium salts, which were converted to highly functionalized diarylamines through an atom&#8208;efficient one&#8208;pot N&#8208;arylation/ring opening reaction with external nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds through in situ formation of a diarylammonium intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic ring opening by cleavage of the strong C&#8722;N bond. A wide variety of diarylamines was obtained through introduction of two different aryl groups of varied electronics, and the retained iodo&#8208;substituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group tolerance, and the strategy proved efficient also in in late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Cyanines: Ultrabright Cyanine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Supramolecular Materials in Solution and in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular approach has been developed to inhibit the undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching of cyanine dyes. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, the resulting supra&#8208;cyanines exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in both solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Fluorescent materials with high brightness play a crucial role in the advancement of various technologies such as bioimaging, photonics, and OLEDs. While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine&#8208;based fluorescent materials by addressing long&#8208;standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Supra&#8208;cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, and exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 50&#8201;%) in both solution and in the solid state. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine&#8208;based supramolecular materials.

         <title>Mechanical Effects of Elastic Crystals Driven by Natural Sunlight and Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate&#8208;derived elastic crystal (BPDT) driven by natural sunlight and mechanical forces was constructed. The crystal showed backlight plastic bending properties under natural sunlight irradiation. Moreover, the crystal has great potential for application in robotic arms.







Abstract
Flexible crystals that can capture solar energy and convert it into mechanical energy are promising for a wide range of applications such as information storage and actuators, but obtaining them remains a challenge. Herein, an elastic crystal of a barbiturate derivative was found to be an excellent candidate, demonstrating plastic bending behavior under natural sunlight irradiation. 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum data of microcrystals before and after light irradiation demonstrated that light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition was the driving force for the photomechanical effects. Interestingly, the crystals retained elastic bending even after light irradiation. This is the first report of flexible crystals that can be driven by natural sunlight and that have both photomechanical properties and elasticity. Furthermore, regulation of the passive light output direction of the crystals and transport of objects by applying mechanical forces and light was demonstrated.

         <title>Adaptive Catalysts for the Selective Hydrogenation of Bicyclic Heteroaromatics using Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a CO2&#8208;Responsive Support</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on an amine&#8208;functionalized polymer&#8208;grafted silica material act as adaptive catalysts for the hydrogenation of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives, producing partially saturated products under H2/CO2, and fully saturated products under H2. The selectivity switch is reversible, rapid, and robust, and originates from the formation of ammonium formate species under H2/CO2, and their decomposition under H2.







Abstract
Ruthenium nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on an amine&#8208;functionalized polymer&#8208;grafted silica support act as adaptive catalysts for the hydrogenation of bicyclic heteroaromatics. Whereas full hydrogenation of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives is achieved under pure H2, introducing CO2 into the H2 gas phase leads to an effective shutdown of the arene hydrogenation while preserving the activity for the hydrogenation of the heteroaromatic part. The selectivity switch originates from the generation of ammonium formate species on the surface of the materials by catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. The CO2 hydrogenation is fully reversible, resulting in a robust and rapid switch between the two states of the catalyst adapting its performance in response to the feed gas composition. A variety of benzofuran and quinoline derivatives were hydrogenated to fully or partially saturated products in high selectivity and yields simply by altering the composition of the feed gas from H2 to H2/CO2. The adaptive catalytic system thus provides controlled access to valuable products using a single catalyst rather than two specific and distinct catalysts with static reactivity.

         <title>A Photo&#8208; and Thermo&#8208;Driven Azoarene&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Molecular Switch in a Liquid Crystal Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;driven azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch has been designed. Reversible modulation of the polarization inversion and on&#8208;off&#8208;switchable circularly polarized luminescence in a helical superstructure have also been demonstrated.







Abstract
The development of chiral optical active materials with switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals remains a challenge. Here an azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch, (S, R, S)&#8208;switch 1 and (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, are designed and prepared with an (R)&#8208;binaphthyl azo group as a chiral photosensitive moiety and two (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;binaphthyl fluorescent molecules with opposite or the same handedness as chiral fluorescent moieties. Both switches exhibit reversible trans/cis isomerization when irradiated by 365&#8197;nm UV light and 520&#8197;nm green light in solvent and liquid crystal (LC) media. In contrast with the control (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, when switch 1 is doped into nematic LCs, polarization inversion and switching&#8208;off of the CPL signals are achieved in the resultant helical superstructure upon irradiation with 365&#8197;nm UV and 520&#8197;nm green light, respectively. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the system is basically unchanged during this switching process. In particular, these variations of the CPL signals could be recovered after heating, realizing the true sense of CPL reversible switching. Taking advantage of the unique CPL switching, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for &#8220;a dual&#8208;optical information encryption system&#8221; based on the above CPL active material is demonstrated.

         <title>Nitrite and Nitric Oxide Interconversion at Mononuclear Copper(II): Insight into the Role of the Red Copper Site in Denitrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent geometric preference on the bidirectional reactivity of NOx at mononuclear copper(II) sites was investigated. The involvement of the same copper(II) coordination motif in both nitrite reductase (NIR) and nitric oxide oxidase (NOO) activities provides insight into the functional roles of unusual red copper protein in interconverting nitrite and NO.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) interconversion is crucial for maintaining optimum NO flux in mammalian physiology. Herein we demonstrate that [L2CuII(nitrite)]+ moieties (in 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b; where, L&#8201;=&#8201;Me2PzPy and Me2PzQu) with distorted octahedral geometry undergo facile reduction to provide tetrahedral [L2CuI]+ (in 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) and NO in the presence of biologically relevant reductants, such as 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (4&#8208;MeO&#8208;2,6&#8208;DTBP, a tyrosine model) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, a NAD(P)H model). Interestingly, the reaction of excess NO gas with [L2CuII(MeCN)2]2+ (in 1&#8201;a) provides a putative {CuNO}10 species, which is effective in mediating the nitrosation of various nucleophiles, such as thiol and amine. Generation of the transient {CuNO}10 species in wet acetonitrile leads to NO2&#8722; as assessed by Griess assay and 14N/15N&#8208;FTIR analyses. A detailed study reveals that the bidirectional NOx&#8208;reactivity, namely, nitrite reductase (NIR) and NO oxidase (NOO), at a common CuII site, is governed by the geometric&#8208;preference&#8208;driven facile CuII/CuI redox process. Of broader interest, this study not only highlights potential strategies for the design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for nitrite reduction, but also strengthens the previous postulates regarding the involvement of red copper proteins in denitrification.

         <title>Selectivity Control in the Direct CO Esterification over Pd@UiO&#8208;66: The Pd Location Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Pd nanoparticles into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibits high selectivity for dimethyl carbonate (DMC), while Pd nanoparticles on MOFs and other supports give high selectivity for dimethyl oxalate (DMO) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite. The Lewis acid microenvironment surrounding Pd NPs is responsible for the reversed product selectivity.







Abstract
The selectivity control of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) in the direct CO esterification with methyl nitrite toward dimethyl oxalate (DMO) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC) remains a grand challenge. Herein, Pd NPs are incorporated into isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;H, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;NH2), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X, which unexpectedly exhibit high selectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to DMC and regulated activity in the direct CO esterification. In sharp contrast, the Pd NPs supported on the MOF, yielding Pd/UiO&#8208;66, displays high selectivity (89&#8201;%) to DMO as always reported with Pd NPs. Both experimental and DFT calculation results prove that the Pd location relative to UiO&#8208;66 gives rise to discriminated microenvironment of different amounts of interface between Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and Pd NPs in Pd@UiO&#8208;66 and Pd/UiO&#8208;66, resulting in their distinctly different selectivity. This is an unprecedented finding on the production of DMC by Pd NPs, which was previously achieved by Pd(II) only, in the direct CO esterification.

         <title>The Synthesis of a Multiple D&#8211;A Conjugated Macrocycle and Its Application in Organic Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple D&#8211;A ring&#8208;like conjugated molecule, RCM was synthesized via a template&#8208;directed process. RCM inherits the superior photovoltaic properties characteristic of D&#8211;A linear molecules, including a narrow optical gap and effective charge transfer. Importantly, RCM demonstrates reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, attributable to its minimized vibration.







Abstract
As a novel class of materials, D&#8211;A conjugated macrocycles hold significant promise for chemical science. However, their potential in photovoltaic remains largely untapped due to the complexity of introducing multiple donor and acceptor moieties into the design and synthesis of cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Here, we report a multiple D&#8211;A ring&#8208;like conjugated molecule (RCM) via the coupling of dimer molecule DBTP&#8208;C3 as a template and thiophenes in high yields. RCM exhibits a narrow optical gap (1.33&#8197;eV) and excellent thermal stability, and shows a remarkable photoluminescence yield (&#934;PL) of 11.1&#8201;% in solution, much higher than non&#8208;cyclic analogues. Organic solar cell (OSC) constructed with RCM as electron acceptor shows efficient charge separation at donor&#8208;acceptor band offsets and achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2&#8201;%&#8208;approximately fourfold higher than macrocycle&#8208;based OSCs reported so far. This is partly due to low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss down to 0.20&#8197;eV and a high electroluminescence yield (&#934;EL) of 4&#215;10&#8722;4. Our findings emphasize the potential of D&#8211;A cyclic conjugated molecules in advancing organic photovoltaic technology.

         <title>Azoxy Compounds&#8212;From Synthesis to Reagents for Azoxy Group Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein is the synthesis of sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds from nitroso arenes and iminoiodinanes by using visible light irradiation. The bench&#8208;stable sulfonyl azoxy compounds can be used in azoxy group transfer reactions for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ether molecules and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
The azoxy functional group is an important structural motif and represents the formally oxidized counterpart of the azo group. Azoxy compounds find numerous applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to functional materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped with a main focus on the formation symmetric azoxy compounds. To overcome challenges in the synthesis of such unsymmetric azoxy compounds, we designed a process employing readily accessible nitroso compounds and iminoiodinanes. This method builds on the use of visible light irradiation to generate a triplet nitrene from iminoiodinanes, which is trapped by nitroso arenes to give access to sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds with a good substrate scope and functional group tolerance. We further describe two applications of these sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds as radical precursors in synthesis, where the whole azoxy group can be transferred and employed in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ethers or 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers. All of the reactions occurred at room temperature under visible light irradiation without the addition of any photoredox catalysts and additives. Control experiments, mechanism investigations, and DFT studies well explained the observed reactivity.

         <title>Chemoselective Quinoline and Isoquinoline Reduction by Energy Transfer Catalysis Enabled Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkene and a (hetero)arene, to be reduced or retained? In contrast to conventional processes, in the reported hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) protocol enabled by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, the benzenoid ring of a quinoline is more easily reduced than an electron&#8208;deficient alkene. Furthermore, many reducing labile moieties, such as aryl iodides, electron&#8208;deficient alkynes, benzsulfamides, and benzyl ethers, are compatible with this method.







Abstract
(Hetero)arene reduction is one of the key avenues for synthesizing related cyclic alkenes and alkanes. While catalytic hydrogenation and Birch reduction are the two broadly utilized approaches for (hetero)arene reduction across academia and industry over the last century, both methods have encountered significant chemoselectivity challenges. We hereby introduce a highly chemoselective quinoline and isoquinoline reduction protocol operating through selective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, which enables subsequent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The design of this protocol bypasses the conventional metric of reduction reaction, that is, the reductive potential, and instead relies on the triplet energies of the chemical moieties and the kinetic barriers of energy and hydrogen atom transfer events. Many reducing labile functional groups, which were incompatible with previous (hetero)arene reduction reactions, are retained in this reaction. We anticipate that this protocol will trigger the further advancement of chemoselective arene reduction and enable the current arene&#8208;rich drug space to escape from flatland.

         <title>Densely Packed CO2 Aids Charge, Spin, and Lattice Ordering Partially Fluctuated in a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic phase transition temperature increased from 65 to 100&#8197;K via CO2 adsorption in a two&#8208;dimensional layered magnet composed of a paddlewheel&#8208;type diruthenium unit and TCNQ derivatives because of the suppression of charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure upon CO2 accommodation.







Abstract
Partial charge fluctuations in the charge&#8208;ordered state of a material, often triggered by structural disorders and/or defects, can significantly alter its physical characteristics, such as magnetic long&#8208;range ordering. However, it is difficult to post&#8208;chemically fix such accidental partial fluctuations to reconstruct a uniform charge&#8208;ordered state. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;aided charge ordering demonstrated in a CO2&#8208;post&#8208;captured layered magnet, [{Ru2(o&#8208;ClPhCO2)4}2{TCNQ(OMe)2}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;CO2 (1&#8835;CO2; o&#8208;ClPhCO2&#8722;=ortho&#8208;chlorobenzoate; TNCQ(OMe)2=2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane). Pristine porous layered magnet 1 had a partially charge&#8208;fluctuated ordered state, which provided ferrimagnetic ordering at TC=65&#8197;K. Upon loading CO2, 1 adsorbed one mole of CO2, forming 1&#8835;CO2, and raising TC to 100&#8197;K. This was because of the vanishing charge fluctuations without significantly changing the framework structure. This research illustrates the post&#8208;accessible host&#8211;guest chemistry delicately combined with charge, spin, and lattice ordering in a spongy magnet. Furthermore, it highlights how this innovative approach opens up new possibilities for technology and nanoscale magnetism manipulation.

         <title>Alignment of Heptagonal Diimide and Triazine Enables Narrowband Pure&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have created an efficient sky&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer by aligning heptagonal diimide and triazine acceptors. This innovative hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy has enabled us to fabricate narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF sensitized fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The endeavor to develop high&#8208;performance narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low efficiency roll&#8208;off represents an attractive challenge. Herein, we introduce a hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy centered around the heptagonal diimide (BPI) building block to create an efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. The alignment of a twisted BPI unit and a planar diphenyltriazine (TRZ) fragment imparts remarkable exciton dynamic properties to 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI, including a fast radiative decay rate (kR) of 1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a swift reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.8&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, complemented by a slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate (kNR) of 6.0&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1. Consequently, 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI facilitates the fabrication of high&#8208;performance narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.3&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off even at a high brightness level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE10000: 16.8&#8201;%). This showcases a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2 for narrowband blue TSF&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Binary Silicon&#8208;Centered Organoboron Catalyst with Superior Performance to That of Its Bifunctional Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In general, two&#8208;component catalysts containing Lewis pairs are inferior to one&#8208;component ones due to the lack of intramolecular synergy. A silicon&#8208;centered bimolecular catalyst has been developed that exhibits a rare higher activity than its unimolecular analogue, even at low loadings. A unique two&#8208;path initiation mode was proposed to explain its exceptional catalytic performance in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide.







Abstract
This work reported that a silicon&#8208;centered alkyl borane/ammonium salt binary (two&#8208;component) catalyst exhibits much higher activity than its bifunctional analogue (one&#8208;component) for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of propylene oxide, showing 7.3&#8197;times the activity of its bifunctional analogue at a low catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;%, and even 15.3&#8197;times the activity at an extremely low loading of 0.002&#8197;mol&#8201;%. By using 19F NMR spectroscopy, control experiments, and theoretical calculation we discovered that the central silicon atom displays appropriate electron density and a larger intramolecular cavity, which is useful to co&#8208;activate the monomer and to deliver propagating chains, thus leading to a better intramolecular synergic effect than its bifunctional analogue. A unique two&#8208;pathway initiation mode was proposed to explain the unusual high activity of the binary catalytic system. This study breaks the traditional impression of the binary Lewis acid/nucleophilic catalyst with poor activity because of the increase in entropy.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborosiloxanes: Non&#8208;traditional Luminescent Polymers with Red Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>

The synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions has been used to construct non&#8208;traditional fluorescence polymers with long emission wavelengths and fluorescence lifetimes. This has led to a hyperbranched polyborosiloxane that exhibits red emission at 640&#8197;nm and delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s.







Abstract
Non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers have attracted significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility and diverse applications. However, designing and preparing non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers that simultaneously possess long emission wavelengths and long fluorescence lifetime remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes (P1&#8211;P4) were synthesized. As the electron density increases on the monomer diol, the optimal emission wavelengths of the P1&#8211;P4 polymers gradually red&#8208;shift to 510, 570, 575, and 640&#8197;nm, respectively. In particular, P4 not only exhibits red emission but also demonstrates delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s and the lowest critical cluster concentration (1.76&#8197;mg/mL). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction was the key factor contributing to the red&#8208;light emission with delayed fluorescence. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in dual&#8208;information encryption. This study provides a universal design strategy for the development of unconventional fluorescent polymers with both delayed fluorescence and long&#8208;wavelength emission.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Product Observation for CO2 Electroreduction Using Synchronised Electrochemistry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry with Soft Ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI)</title>

         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) products is unambiguously elucidated with high temporal resolution using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry with soft ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI), where CO species can be detected without the interference of CO2 fragmentation, providing insights about the reaction mechanism and kinetics for CO2RR.







Abstract
The mechanistic understanding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a rapid and accurate characterisation of product distribution to unravel the activity and selectivity, which is yet hampered by the lack of advanced correlative approaches. Here, we present the time&#8208;resolved identification of CO2RR products by using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry (sEC&#8208;MS). Transients in product formation can be readily captured in relation to electrochemical conditions. Moreover, a soft ionisation (SI) strategy is developed in MS for the direct observation of CO, immune to the interference of CO2 fragments. With the sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI, the kinetic information, such as Tafel slopes and onset potentials, for a myriad of CO2RR products are revealed and we show the hysteresis seen for the evolution of some species may originate from the potential&#8208;driven changes in surface coverage of intermediates. This work provides a real&#8208;time picture of the dynamic formation of CO2RR products.

         <title>Neuroprotective Bioorthogonal Catalysis in Mitochondria Using Protein&#8208;Integrated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic self&#8208;assembly of proteins with hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) endowed with catalytic activity led to biocomposites that acted as bioorthogonal chemical catalysts to generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and enzymatic catalysts to decompose hydrogen peroxide. The nanoscale biocomposites were specifically targeted to mitochondria for neuroprotection, thus showing how HOFs can be leveraged for targeted therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis holds promise for controlling cell function precisely, yet achieving selective and efficient chemical reactions within organelles is challenging. In this study, we introduce a new strategy using protein&#8208;integrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to enable synergistic bioorthogonal chemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis within mitochondria. Utilizing catalytically active tris(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylicacid&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) to self&#8208;assemble with [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biscarboximidamide, we synthesized nanoscale RuB&#8208;HOFs that exhibit high photocatalytic reduction activity. Notably, RuB&#8208;HOFs efficiently enter cells and preferentially localize to mitochondria, where they facilitate bioorthogonal photoreduction reactions. Moreover, we show that RuB&#8208;HOFs encapsulating catalase can produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in mitochondria through photocatalytic reduction of pro&#8208;H2S and degrade hydrogen peroxide through enzymatic catalysis simultaneously, offering a significant neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress. Our findings not only introduce a versatile chemical toolset for mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis for prodrug activation but also pave the way for potential therapeutic applications in treating diseases related to cellular oxidative stress.

         <title>Advanced Lithium Extraction Membranes Derived from Tagged&#8208;Modification of Polyamide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tagged&#8208;modification approach has been developed to selectively modify the top and bottom parts of a polyamide membrane, thereby resulting in the highest current Mg2+/Li+ separation performance that is stable over a 30&#8208;day test. A large&#8208;area (0.24&#8197;m2) membrane was prepared and made into spiral&#8208;wound modules, which show high efficacy in extracting lithium from simulated brines.







Abstract
Efficient Mg2+/Li+ separation is crucial to combating the lithium shortage worldwide, yet current nanofiltration membranes suffer from low efficacy and/or poor scalability, because desirable properties of membranes are entangled and there is a trade&#8208;off. This work reports a &#8220;tagged&#8208;modification&#8221; approach to tackle the challenge. A mixture of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;trimethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium bromide (E1) and 3&#8208;aminopropyltrimethylazanium (E2) was designed to modify polyethylenimine &#8211; trimesoyl chloride (PEI&#8208;TMC) membranes. E1 and E2 reacted with the PEI and TMC, respectively, and thus, the membrane properties (hydrophilicity, pore sizes, charge) were untangled and intensified simultaneously. The permeance (34.3&#8197;L m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1) and Mg2+/Li+ selectivity (23.2) of the modified membranes are about 4&#8197;times and 2&#8197;times higher than the pristine membrane, and they remain stable in a 30&#8208;days test. The permeance is the highest among all analogous nanofiltration membranes. The tagged&#8208;modification method enables the preparation of large&#8208;area membranes and modules that produce high&#8208;purity lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) from simulated brine.

&lt;p&gt;A tagged-modification approach has been developed to selectively modify the top and bottom parts of a polyamide membrane, thereby resulting in the highest current Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; separation performance that is stable over a 30-day test. A large-area (0.24&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) membrane was prepared and made into spiral-wound modules, which show high efficacy in extracting lithium from simulated brines.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Modulated Facet&#8208;selective Charge Separation in Bi4NbO8Cl Single Crystal for Boosting Visible&#8208;light Driven Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive charge transfer channels were constructed by collaborating with the modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, which strengthens the facet&#8208;selective charge separation in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets for boosting visible&#8208;light driven bifunctional water splitting for H2 and O2 evolution.







Abstract
Developing bifunctional water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts is meaningful, but challenged by the harsh requirements of specific&#8208;facet single crystals with spatially separated reactive sites and anisotropic charge transfer paths contributed by well&#8208;built charge driving force. Herein, tunable ferroelectric polarization is introduced in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets to strengthen the orthogonal charge transfer channels. By manipulating the in&#8208;plane polarization from octahedral off&#8208;centering of Nb5+ and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization from lone pair electron effect of anisotropic Bi3+, both the fast charge recombination in bulk catalyst and the process of charge trapping into surface states can be effectively modulated. Collaborating with modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, cooperative charge tractive force is constructed, which reinforces the spatial separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to {110} reductive site facet and {001} oxidation site facet, respectively. While excessive polarization charges impair the facet&#8208;selective charge separation characteristics and conversely promote charge recombination on the surface. As a result, polarity&#8208;optimized Bi4NbO8Cl shows an excellent H2 and O2 evolution rate of 54.21 and 36.08&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This work unveils the function of ferroelectric polarization in tuning the intrinsic facet&#8208;selective charge transfer process of photocatalysts.

         <title>Evoking Ferroptosis by Synergistic Enhancement of a Cyclopentadienyl Iridium&#8208;Betulin Immune Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy was used to develop an immune agonist Ir&#8208;Bet composed of an iridium complex fused with the natural product Betulin, which induced ferritinophagy&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. The MLSE strategy not only promotes effective ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD), but also provides a new mechanism of action for metal&#8208;based anticancer complexes for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) with the potential for antitumor immunity activation. In this study, a nonferrous cyclopentadienyl metal&#8208;based ferroptosis inducer [Ir(Cp*)(Bet)Cl]Cl (Ir&#8208;Bet) was developed by a metal&#8208;ligand synergistic enhancement (MLSE) strategy involving the reaction of [Ir(Cp*)Cl]2Cl2 with the natural product Betulin. The fusion of Betulin with iridium cyclopentadienyl (Ir&#8208;Cp*) species as Ir&#8208;Bet not only tremendously enhanced the antiproliferative activity toward cancer cells, but also activated ferritinophagy for iron homeostasis regulation by PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade inhibition with a lower dosage of Betulin, and then evoked an immune response by nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) activation of Ir&#8208;Cp* species. Further immunogenic cell death (ICD) occurred by remarkable ferroptosis through glutathione (GSH) depletion, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) deactivation and ferritinophagy. An in vivo vaccination experiment demonstrated desirable antitumor and immunogenic effects of Ir&#8208;Bet by increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/regulatory T cells (Tregs).

         <title>Guaiacol as an Organic Superoxide Dismutase Mimics for Anti&#8208;ageing a Ru&#8208;based Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guaiacol as an organic superoxide dismutase mimics scavenged superoxide radicals via disproportionation by chelating lithium superoxide on its two functional groups. Additionally, guaiacol formed homogeneously thin polymeric cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability. Resultantly, guaiacol successfully anti&#8208;aged lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich layered oxides using oxygen redox as well as transition metal redox suffer from its structural instability due to lattice oxygen escaped from its structure during oxygen redox and the following electrolyte decomposition by the reactive oxygen species. Herein, we rescued a Li&#8208;rich layered oxide based on 4d transition metal by employing an organic superoxide dismutase mimics as a homogeneous electrolyte additive. Guaiacol scavenged superoxide radicals via dismutation or disproportionation to convert two superoxide molecules to peroxide and dioxygen after absorbing lithium superoxide on its partially negative oxygen of methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, guaiacol was decomposed to form a thin and stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer, endowing the cathode with the interfacial stability.

         <title>A Heterometallic Porphyrin Dimer as a Potential Quantum Gate: Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations and Spin Coherence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that a vanadyl&#8208;copper meso&#8208;meso linked bisporphyrin complex has good spin coherence and a sizeable magnetic exchange interaction, making it suitable for operating two&#8208;qubit molecular spin&#8208;based quantum gates over a wide range of operation conditions. Theoretical calculations show that the super&#8208;exchange interaction is granted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of the vanadyl magnetic orbital despite the tilting angle of the two rings.







Abstract
In the development of two&#8208;qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin&#8208;spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states |00&#10217; |01&#10217; |10&#10217; |11&#10217; by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso&#8208;meso (m&#8208;m) singly&#8208;linked VIVO&#8722;CuII porphyrin dimer. X&#8208;band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic CuII porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different g&#8208;tensors of VIV and CuII&#8208;ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role.

&lt;p&gt;Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that a vanadyl-copper meso-meso linked bisporphyrin complex has good spin coherence and a sizeable magnetic exchange interaction, making it suitable for operating two-qubit molecular spin-based quantum gates over a wide range of operation conditions. Theoretical calculations show that the super-exchange interaction is granted by the out-of-plane component of the vanadyl magnetic orbital despite the tilting angle of the two rings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the development of two-qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin-spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states |00&#10217; |01&#10217; |10&#10217; |11&#10217; by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso-meso (m-m) singly-linked V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrin dimer. X-band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different &lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;-tensors of V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single-spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Recognition Regulates Coordination Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coordination molecular recognition strategy is proposed to precisely regulate the local coordination structure of single&#8208;atom sites. Specifically, utilizing five&#8208;membered heterocycle molecules as the ligands, the coordination interaction between the guest&#8208;host molecules induces molecular recognition and ensures further precise settlement of the heteroatoms into the local coordination structure of the metal atoms in the single&#8208;atom sites.







Abstract
Coordination engineering for single&#8208;atom sites has drawn increasing attention, yet its chemical synthesis remains a tough issue, especially for tailorable coordination structures. Herein, a molecular recognition strategy is proposed to fabricate single&#8208;atom sites with regulable local coordination structures. Specifically, a heteroatom&#8208;containing ligand serves as the guest molecule to induce coordination interaction with the metal&#8208;containing host, precisely settling the heteroatoms into the local structure of single&#8208;atom sites. As a proof of concept, thiophene is selected as the guest molecule, and sulfur atoms are successfully introduced into the local coordination structure of iron single&#8208;atom sites. Ultrahigh oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity is achieved with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the strategy possesses excellent universality towards diversified types of single&#8208;atom sites. This work makes breakthroughs in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and affords new opportunities in structural regulation at the atomic level.

         <title>Encapsulation of Palladium Carbide Subnanometric Species in Zeolite Boosts Highly Selective Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subnanometric Pd carbide species are encapsulated in MFI zeolite via a carbonization&#8208;reduction method. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity (&gt;99&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%) for semihydrogenation of alkynes. The generated carbon species modulate both the Pd species and zeolite support, facilitating alkene desorption and thus leading to superior alkene selectivity.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is a crucial step in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, the widely utilized palladium (Pd)&#8208;based catalysts often suffer from poor selectivity. In this work, we demonstrate a carbonization&#8208;reduction method to create palladium carbide subnanometric species within pure silicate MFI zeolite. The carbon species can modify the electronic and steric characteristics of Pd species by forming the predominant Pd&#8722;C4 structure and, meanwhile, facilitate the desorption of alkenes by forming the Si&#8722;O&#8722;C structure with zeolite framework, as validated by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations and theoretical calculations. The developed catalyst shows superior performance in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), with 99&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at a complete conversion of phenylacetylene. In contrast, the zeolite&#8208;encapsulated carbon&#8208;free Pd catalyst and the commercial Lindlar catalyst show only 15&#8201;% and 14&#8201;% selectivity to styrene, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. The zeolite&#8208;confined Pd&#8208;carbide subnanoclusters promise their superior properties in semihydrogenation of alkynes.

         <title>Tailored Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron using Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]Indole as a Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Bridge</title>

         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;green multiple resonance emitter IDID2BN using indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole skeleton is obtained without sophisticated purification. It has a narrow green emission at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%. The corresponding electroluminescence device shows a high external quantum efficiency of 36.6&#8201;% as well as an extremely small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.1&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd/m2.







Abstract
Extending the &#960;&#8208;skeletons of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi&#8208;nitrogen bridge and develop a high&#8208;efficiency &#960;&#8208;extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high&#8208;yield one&#8208;shot multiple Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;&#8208;extended MR skeleton, but a compact N&#8208;ethylene&#8208;N motif for a red&#8208;shifted narrowband emission. An emission peak at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are concurrently obtained in dilute toluene. The extended molecular plane also results in a large horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 87&#8201;%. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% and a maximum power efficiency of 135.2&#8197;lm/W are thereafter recorded for the corresponding device, also allowing a low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 34.5&#8201;% and 28.1&#8201;% at luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd/m2 and 10,000&#8197;cd/m2, respectively.

         <title>An Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Precise Detection of the Pulmonary Metastatic Tumors: A Traditional Molecule Having a Stunning Turn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reinventing strategy was exploited to develop an activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe (PMT9) for lung tumor&#8208;specific imaging. The obtained PMT9 exhibited ultra&#8208;sensitivity towards tumor metabolic acidity, which makes it exclusively shine in lung tumor lesions rather than normal lung tissues, enabling precise detection of pulmonary metastasis as well as primary lung tumor, with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.







Abstract
An accurate detection of lung metastasis is of great significance for making better treatment choices and improving cancer prognosis, but remains a big challenge in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a reinventing strategy to develop a pH&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoprobe, pulmonary metastasis tracer (denoted as PMT), based on assembly of NIR dye IR780 and calcium phosphate (CaP). By delicately tuning the intermolecular interactions during the assembly process and dye doping content, as well as the synthetic condition of probe, the fluorescence of PMT could be finely adjusted via the tumor acidity&#8208;triggered disassembly. Notably, the selected PMT9 could sharply convert subtle pH variations into a distinct fluorescence signal to generate high fluorescence ON/OFF contrast, dramatically reducing the background signals. Benefiting from such preferable features, PMT9 is able to precisely identify not only the tumor sites in orthotopic lung cancer models but also the pulmonary metastases in mice with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR). This study provides a unique strategy to turn shortcomings of traditional dye IR780 during in vivo imaging into advantages and further expand the application of fluorescent probe to image lung associated tumor lesions.

&lt;p&gt;An accurate detection of lung metastasis is of great significance for making better treatment choices and improving cancer prognosis, but remains a big challenge in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a reinventing strategy to develop a pH-activatable near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent nanoprobe, pulmonary metastasis tracer (denoted as PMT), based on assembly of NIR dye IR780 and calcium phosphate (CaP). By delicately tuning the intermolecular interactions during the assembly process and dye doping content, as well as the synthetic condition of probe, the fluorescence of PMT could be finely adjusted via the tumor acidity-triggered disassembly. Notably, the selected PMT9 could sharply convert subtle pH variations into a distinct fluorescence signal to generate high fluorescence ON/OFF contrast, dramatically reducing the background signals. Benefiting from such preferable features, PMT9 is able to precisely identify not only the tumor sites in orthotopic lung cancer models but also the pulmonary metastases in mice with remarkable signal-to-background ratio (SBR). This study provides a unique strategy to turn shortcomings of traditional dye IR780 during in vivo imaging into advantages and further expand the application of fluorescent probe to image lung associated tumor lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural and Catalytic Insight into the Unique Pentacyclic Triterpene Synthase TwOSC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryogenic electron microscopy structure of oxidosqualene cyclase from Tripterygium wilfordii (TwOSC) was determined. This enzyme promotes a multistep cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade reaction to generate diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid skeletons. QM/MM simulations were performed and key residues identified to reveal the CSR mechanism. Semirational design of TwOSC was then carried out to promote friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) catalyzed cyclization of the linear substrate (3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;oxidosqualene to form diverse pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) skeletons is one of the most complex reactions in nature. Friedelin has a unique PT skeleton involving a fascinating nine&#8208;step cation shuttle run (CSR) cascade rearrangement reaction, in which the carbocation formed at C2 moves to the other side of the skeleton, runs back to C3 to yield a friedelin cation, which is finally deprotonated. However, as crystal structure data of plant OSCs are lacking, it remains unknown why the CSR cascade reactions occur in friedelin biosynthesis, as does the exact catalytic mechanism of the CSR. In this study, we determined the first cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a plant OSC, friedelin synthase, from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (TwOSC). We also performed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations to reveal the energy profile for the CSR cascade reaction and identify key residues crucial for PT skeleton formation. Furthermore, we semirationally designed two TwOSC mutants, which significantly improved the yields of friedelin and &#946;&#8208;amyrin, respectively.

         <title>Ag+&#8208;Doped InSe Nanosheets for Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer toward Large&#8208;Current Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to a single liquid product, ethanol, in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer is achieved by Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets. Ag+ doping can tailor active sites for maneuvering reaction intermediates toward ethanol production while enhancing the durability of active sites at high current densities.







Abstract
It is an appealing approach to CO2 utilization through CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) to ethanol at high current density; however, the commonly used Cu&#8208;based catalysts cannot sustain large current during CO2ER despite their capability for ethanol production. Herein, we report that Ag+&#8208;doped InSe nanosheets with Se vacancies can address this grand challenge in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the Ag+ doping, which can tailor the electronic structure of InSe while diversifying catalytically active sites, enables the formation of key reaction intermediates and their sequential evolution into ethanol. More importantly, such a material can well work for large&#8208;current conditions in MEA electrolyzers with In2+ species stabilized via electron transfer from Ag to Se. Remarkably, in an MEA electrolyzer by coupling cathodic CO2ER with anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the optimal catalyst exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 68.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 186.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on the cathode with a full&#8208;cell ethanol energy efficiency of 26.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V. This work opens an avenue for large&#8208;current production of ethanol from CO2 with high selectivity and energy efficiency by rationally designing electrocatalysts.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Nitrogen Cluster Providing a Local Proton for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of isostructural Cu6 clusters (Cu6&#8722;NH, Cu6&#8722;N and Cu6&#8722;py) enabled the structure&#8722;activity relationship in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to be studied at the atomic level. The protonated pyrimidine N in Cu6&#8722;NH could act as a proton relay station to provide a local proton, enabling the formation of the key *COOH intermediate during CO generation, which significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Atomically precise Cu clusters are highly desirable as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and they provide an appropriate model platform for elaborating their structure&#8211;activity relationship. However, an efficient overall photocatalytic CO2RR with H2O using assembled Cu&#8208;cluster aggregates as single component photocatalyst has not been reported. Herein, we report a stable crystalline Cu&#8722;S&#8722;N cluster photocatalyst with local protonated N&#8722;H groups (denoted as Cu6&#8722;NH). The catalyst exhibits suitable photocatalytic redox potentials, high structural stability, active catalytic species, and a narrow band gap, which account for its outstanding photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light, with &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity for CO evolution. Remarkably, systematic isostructural Cu&#8208;cluster control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed that the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in the Cu6&#8722;NH cluster act as a proton relay station, providing a local proton during the photocatalytic CO2RR. This efficiently lowers the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step, efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of atomically precise metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomer for Multi&#8208;Level Encryption and Transient Information Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dual&#8208;responsive polydomain liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed, which can change from opaque to transparent states under strain or temperature stimuli. The as&#8208;prepared LCEs can achieve multi&#8208;level information encryption based on strain response and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display upon incorporating photothermal multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes.







Abstract
Information security has gained increasing attention in the past decade, leading to the development of advanced materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption and instantaneous information display. However, it remains challenging to achieve high information security with simple encryption procedures and low&#8208;energy stimuli. Herein, a series of strain/temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed to achieve dual&#8208;modal, multi&#8208;level information encryption and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display. The as&#8208;prepared polydomain LCEs can change from an opaque state to a transparent state under strain or temperature stimuli, with the transition strains or temperatures highly dependent on the concentration of long&#8208;chain flexible spacers. Information encrypted by different LCE inks can be decrypted under specific strains or temperatures, leading to multi&#8208;level protection of information security. Furthermore, with the combination of the phase transition of polydomain LCEs and the photothermal effect of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), we achieved a repeatable transient information display by using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light as a pen for writing. This study provides new insight into the development of advanced encryption materials with versatility and high security for broad applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;Substituted Styrenes via Late&#8208;Stage Stereomutation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes has been developed, providing a convenient and efficient approach to enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products. The key of the success is the development of a formal late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which could enable chiral cis&#8208;isomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer, thus achieving high diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes. The lynchpin of success is ascribed to the development of a late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which enables enantioenriched cis&#8208;isomers among a couple of early&#8208;generated diastereomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer counterparts, thus fulfilling high diastereocontrol; while the degree of enantio&#8208;differentiation is determined by the borocupration process of the C=C bond. This reaction provides an efficient protocol to access enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208; dioxygenation products. The value of this method has further been highlighted in a diversity of follow&#8208;up stereospecific transformations and further modifying complex molecules.

         <title>Synergistic Interplay of Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Sites on Metallic Ni&#8208;MOFs Loaded with Pt for Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Conversion of Atmospheric CO2 under Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loaded with Pt was fabricated, which has dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites for separately boosting atmospheric CO2 capture and in situ photocatalytic conversion under infrared light irradiation. This finding opens a promising route to use conductive MOFs as new generation photocatalysts for efficient conversion of trace CO2 via energy&#8208;efficient methods.







Abstract
Infrared light driven photocatalytic reduction of atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to the ultralow concentration of CO2 (0.04&#8201;%) and the low energy of infrared light. Herein, we develop a metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework loaded with Pt (Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF), which shows excellent activity for thermal&#8208;photocatalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 with H2 even under infrared light irradiation. The open Ni sites are beneficial to capture and activate atmospheric CO2, while the photogenerated electrons dominate H2 dissociation on the Pt sites. Simultaneously, thermal energy results in spilling of the dissociated H2 to Ni sites, where the adsorbed CO2 is thermally reduced to CO and CH4. The synergistic interplay of dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites renders Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF a record efficiency of 9.57&#8201;% at 940&#8197;nm for converting atmospheric CO2, enables the procurement of CO2 to be independent of the emission sources, and improves the energy efficiency for trace CO2 conversion by eliminating the capture media regeneration and molecular CO2 release.

         <title>Subrutilane&#8212;A Hexacyclic Sesterterpene from Streptomyces subrutilus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining uncovered a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus that produces the first known hexacyclic sesterterpene with no double bonds as the main product, as well as eight pentacyclic products. Isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations revealed a cyclisation cascade via several well&#8208;stabilised secondary cations. The enzyme also converted several substrate analogues into sesterterpenoid compounds.







Abstract
Mining of a terpene synthase from Streptomyces subrutilus resulted in the identification of the hexacyclic sesterterpene subrutilane, besides eight pentacyclic side products. Subrutilane represents the first case of a saturated sesterterpene hydrocarbon. Its structure, including the absolute configuration, was unambiguously determined through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and stereoselective deuteration. The cyclisation mechanism to subrutilane and its side products was investigated in all detail by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The subrutilane synthase (SrS) also converted (2Z)&#8208;GFPP into one major product. Additional compounds were obtained from the substrate analogues (7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP and (2Z,7R)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dihydro&#8208;GFPP with blocked reactivity at the C6&#8722;C7 bond. Interestingly, the early steps of the cyclisation cascade with (2Z)&#8208;GFPP and the saturated substrate analogues were analogous to those of GFPP, but then deviations from the natural cyclisation mode occur.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Biltz Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective Biltz synthesis is established, which provides a straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins in high yields with excellent stereocontrol. Isotopic tracer experiments and DFT calculations reveal an exclusive 1,2&#8208;ester shift process. The observed enantioselectivity and regioselectivity originate from [3+2] cyclization step.







Abstract
The Biltz synthesis establishes straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins by combining a 1,2&#8208;diketone and a (thio)urea. Its appealing features include inherent atom and step economy together with the potential to generate structurally diverse products. However, control of the stereochemistry of this reaction has proven to be a daunting challenge. Herein, we describe the first example of enantioselective catalytic Biltz synthesis which affords more than 40 thiohydantoins with high stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control, irrespective of the symmetry of thiourea structure. A one pot synthesis of corresponding hydantoins is also documented. Remarkably, experimental studies and DFT calculations establish the reaction pathway and origin of stereoselectivity.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Cobalt&#8208;Doped 1T&#8208;MoS2 Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic ligand modulation plus cobalt doping strategy is applied to modulate the orbital hybridization of 1T&#8208;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;MOF precursors. The polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpe) ligand can stably link with 1T&#8208;MoS2 layers to achieve expanded interlayer spacing, which promotes the joint participation of highly efficient active sites in the basal plane and the interlayer in alkaline HER processes.







Abstract
Highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst will determine the mass distributions of hydrogen&#8208;powered clean technologies, while still faces grand challenges. In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T&#8722;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;metal&#8208;organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T&#8722;MoS2. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two&#8208;dimensional 1T&#8722;MoS2 layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS2 (Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T&#8722;MoS2 originate in the formation of three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic constructs by linking &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo&#8208;3d and S&#8208;2p orbitals, and in turn makes S&#8208;2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H&#8208;1s orbital. Therefore, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In addition, integrated into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe is much superior to the Pt/C catalyst at the large current densities. This study provides a feasible ligand modulation strategy for designs of two&#8208;dimensional catalysts.

     alt="Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Cobalt-Doped 1T-MoS2 Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A synergistic ligand modulation plus cobalt doping strategy is applied to modulate the orbital hybridization of 1T-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst via CoMo-MOF precursors. The polydentate 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpe) ligand can stably link with 1T-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers to achieve expanded interlayer spacing, which promotes the joint participation of highly efficient active sites in the basal plane and the interlayer in alkaline HER processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst will determine the mass distributions of hydrogen-powered clean technologies, while still faces grand challenges. In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst via CoMo-metal-organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two-dimensional 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; originate in the formation of three-dimensional metal-organic constructs by linking &#960;-conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo-3d and S-2p orbitals, and in turn makes S-2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H-1s orbital. Therefore, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Tuning the Catalytic Activity of a Pincer Complex of Rhodium(I) by Supramolecular and Redox Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties of a (CNC)&#8208;pincer Rh(I) complex decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety have been shown to be modified in response to supramolecular (coronene) or redox (fluoride) additives. This leads to a significant modification of its catalytic activity toward the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids.







Abstract
We report the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]+, in which CNC&#8722;NDI refers to a pincer&#8208;CNC ligand decorated with a naphthalenediimide moiety. Due to the presence of the planar CNC ligand and the naphthalenediimide moiety, the electronic nature of the complex can be modulated by means of supramolecular and redox stimuli, respectively. The metal complex shows a strong &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking interaction with coronene. This interaction has an impact on the electron&#8208;richness of the metal, as demonstrated by the shifting of the &#957;(CO) stretching band to a lower frequency. The addition of tetrabutylammonium fluoride facilitates the sequential one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction of the NDI moiety of the ligand, thus resulting in a situation in which the ligand can increase its electron&#8208;donor strength in two levels. The nature of the interaction with the fluoride anion was studied computationally. The catalytic activity of the [Rh(CNC&#8722;NDI)(CO)]+ complex was tested in the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids, where it is observed that the activity of the catalyst can be modulated between four levels of activity, which correspond to i) the use of the unmodified catalyst, ii) catalyst+coronene, iii) catalyst+2&#8197;equivalents of fluoride, and iv) catalyst+5&#8197;equivalents of fluoride.

         <title>Visible Light Photoiniferter Polymerization for Dispersity Control in High Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoiniferter RAFT polymerization was used to tune the dispersity in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers (up to ca. 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as well as in multiblock copolymers. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogeneous radical source, visible&#8208;light regulation, and high end&#8208;group fidelity and holds great potential for the synthesis of pre&#8208;designed materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.







Abstract
The synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence, and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible&#8208;light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent highly living nature of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by the addition of acid. In addition to a switchable chain&#8208;transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in terms of dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that the highly living nature was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. Tg was lowered for high&#8208;dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low&#8208;MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential for the synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides in good to high levels of enantiomeric excess was achieved using a chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst. Experimental results together with DFT calculations support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process, whose efficiency is impacted by developing steric interactions in the syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate complexes.







Abstract
Although there are many methods for the asymmetric synthesis of monosubstituted allylic fluorides, construction of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides has not been reported. To address this gap, we report an enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides using chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst, Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3HF as a source of fluoride, and Morita Baylis Hillman (MBH) trichloroacetimidates. Kinetic studies show that one enantiomer of racemic MBH substrate reacts faster than the other. Computational studies reveal that both syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes are formed upon ionization of allylic substrate, and the syn complexes are slightly energetically favorable. This is in contrast to our previous observation for formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates, in which the syn &#960;&#8208;allyl conformation is strongly preferred. In addition, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C2 position of racemic MBH substrate renders 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate formation endergonic and reversible. To compare, formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates was exergonic and irreversible. DFT calculations and kinetic studies support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process wherein the rate of isomerization of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium complexes is faster than that of fluoride addition onto the more reactive intermediate. The 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides were obtained in good yields, enantioselectivity, and branched selectivity.

A &#8220;chameleon catalyst&#8221; for hydrogenation reactions: The selectivity of an amine&#8208;functionalized ruthenium nanoparticles&#8208;based catalyst can be switched in the hydrogenation of bicyclic heteroaromatics by controlling the feedgas composition, unlocking adaptivity in product formation. The selectivity switch is reversible, rapid, and robust, and originates from the formation of ammonium formate species under H2/CO2, and their decomposition under H2, as reported by Alexis Bordet, Walter Leitner et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311427).

The synthesis of new molecules and materials does not always involve creating bonds.&#160;In their Research Article (e202310354), Jorge Albalad, Inhar Imaz, Daniel Maspoch et&#8197;al. show how bond scission becomes a powerful synthetic tool to design new molecules and materials when the cleavage step is quantitative, selective, and carefully controlled. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, unprecedented Rh(II)&#8208;based architectures (clusters, a crown, and a macrocycle) were obtained through the retrosynthetic disassembly of metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) via Clip&#8208;off Chemistry.

Calculating temperature&#8208;dependent emission lifetimes is like a scavenger hunt. In their Research Article (e202308803), Leticia Gonz&#225;lez et&#8197;al. show that in [Ru(bpy)3]2+, the pathway governed by the lowest&#160;3MC&#8208;trans excited state triplet minimum leads astray. Instead, through the concept of rate&#8208;determining states and an extended kinetic model that takes all the different Jahn&#8211;Teller isomers into account, excellent agreement with the experiment is attained.

This Minireview critically discusses the most promising strategies to improve hydrogen evolution on transition metal based photocatalysts along with future research directions.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) were one of the first photocatalysts used to produce hydrogen from water using solar energy. Despite the emergence of many other genres of photocatalysts over the years, TMO photocatalysts remain dominant due to their easy synthesis and unique physicochemical properties. Various strategies have been developed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TMOs, but the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of TMO photocatalysts is still very low (&lt;2&#8201;%), which is far below the targeted STH of 10&#8201;% for commercial viability. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several widely used strategies, including oxygen defects control, doping, establishing interfacial junctions, and phase&#8208;facet&#8208;morphology engineering, that have been adopted to improve TMO photocatalysts. By critically evaluating these strategies and providing a roadmap for future research directions, this article serves as a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals seeking to develop efficient energy materials for green energy solutions.

Aliphatic polycarbonates (aPCs) are gaining popularity due to their biocompatibility and capacity for on&#8208;demand degradation. This minireview provides a laconic summary of the latest advancements in aPCs processing techniques, encompassing controlled self&#8208;assembly, electrospinning, additive manufacturing, among others. This paper will enrich the toolbox available to researchers, enabling them to select the most suitable technique for their materials.







Abstract
Aliphatic polycarbonates (aPCs) have become increasingly popular as functional materials due to their biocompatibility and capacity for on&#8208;demand degradation. Advances in polymerization techniques and the introduction of new functional monomers have expanded the library of aPCs available, offering a diverse range of chemical compositions and structures. To accommodate the emerging requirements of new applications in biomedical and energy&#8208;related fields, various manufacturing techniques have been adopted for processing aPC&#8208;based materials. However, a summary of these techniques has yet to be conducted. The aim of this paper is to enrich the toolbox available to researchers, enabling them to select the most suitable technique for their materials. In this paper, a concise review of the recent progress in processing techniques, including controlled self&#8208;assembly, electrospinning, additive manufacturing, and other techniques, is presented. We also highlight the specific challenges and opportunities for the sustainable growth of this research area and the successful integration of aPCs in industrial applications.

         <title>Enzymatic Oxy&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Functionalization in Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygenation and amination reactions are widespread in synthetic chemistry to produce valuable compounds. Nowadays, the importance of sustainable strategies to introduce oxygen and amino functionalities into organic molecules is increasing. This review discusses recent examples of multi&#8208;step biocatalytic cascades involving oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions to produce value&#8208;added compounds such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are a powerful tool for building complex molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen functionalities. Moreover, the combination of multiple enzymes in one pot offers the possibility to minimize downstream processing and waste production. In this review, we illustrate various recent efforts in the development of multi&#8208;step syntheses involving C&#8722;O and C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes to produce high value&#8208;added compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors. Both in vitro and in vivo examples are discussed, revealing the respective advantages and drawbacks. The use of engineered enzymes to boost the cascades outcome is also addressed and current co&#8208;substrate and cofactor recycling strategies are presented, highlighting the importance of atom economy. Finally, tools to overcome current challenges for multi&#8208;enzymatic oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions are discussed, including flow systems with immobilized biocatalysts and cascades in confined nanomaterials.

         <dc:description>
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach for the synthesis of hierarchical biomaterials. Hence,it is essential to directly observe the assembly dynamics and structural evolution using in situ characterization approaches. These measurements reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism for improving the accuracy of biomaterials design.







Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly of hierarchical materials is a precise and adaptable bottom&#8208;up approach to synthesizing across scales with considerable energy, health, environment, sustainability, and information technology applications. To achieve desired functions in biomaterials, it is essential to directly observe assembly dynamics and structural evolutions that reflect the underlying energy landscape and the assembly mechanism. This review will summarize the current understanding of biomolecular assembly mechanisms based on in situ characterization and discuss the broader significance and achievements of newly gained insights. In addition, we will also introduce how emerging deep learning/machine learning&#8208;based approaches, multiparametric characterization, and high&#8208;throughput methods can boost the development of biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. The objective of this review is to accelerate the development of in situ characterization approaches for biomolecular self&#8208;assembly and to inspire the next generation of biomimetic materials.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Well&#8208;Defined Fluoropolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;demand synthesis of well&#8208;defined fluoropolymer is important to meet diverse requirements in high&#8208;end applications. This minireview discusses challenges in controlled radical copolymerizations of fluoroalkene feedstocks with non&#8208;fluorinated vinyl comonomers, highlights recent developments toward controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain fluorinated copolymers and emerging explorations toward applications.







Abstract
In the past 80&#8197;years, fluoropolymers have found broad applications in both industrial and academic settings, owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Copolymerizations of fluoroalkene feedstocks present an important avenue to obtain high&#8208;performance materials by merging intrinsic attributes of fluorocarbons and great versatility of comonomers. Recently, while massive investigations have disclosed the great potentials of precisely synthesized polymers, researchers have made considerable efforts to approach well&#8208;defined fluorinated copolymers. This minireview discusses challenges in controlled radical copolymerizations (CRCPs) of fluoroalkenes and provides a concise perspective on recent progress in CRCPs of fluoroalkenes (e.g., tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, hexafluoropropene, perfluoroalkyl vinyl ethers) with non&#8208;fluorinated vinyl comonomers, which have enabled on&#8208;demand preparations of various main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers with predefined molar masses, low dispersities, as well as regulable chemical compositions and sequences. The synthetic advantages of CRCPs will promote controlled and facile access to customized fluoropolymers for high&#8208;tech applications such as batteries, coatings and so on.

         <title>The Universal Super Cation&#8208;Conductivity in Multiple&#8208;cation Mixed Chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several cost&#8208;effective multiple&#8208;cation mixed chloride SSEs with high Li+ conductivity over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 can be synthesized with abundant and cheap Al, La, Ce, Zr, etc. elements. The UCl3&#8208;type skeleton can intake various materials into the skeleton from metal chlorides (MCl, M=Li, Na, K, Cu, Ag) to metal oxides (Li2O) and also displays super&#8208;conduction behavior for those monovalent cations (0.77&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Ag+ conduction).







Abstract
As exciting candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are highly dependent on advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, using cost&#8208;effective LaCl3 and CeCl3 lattice (UCl3&#8208;type structure) as the host and further combined with a multiple&#8208;cation mixed strategy, we report a series of UCl3&#8208;type SSEs with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and good compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. The intrinsic large&#8208;size hexagonal one&#8208;dimensional channels and highly disordered amorphous phase induced by multi&#8208;metal cation species are believed to trigger fast multiple ionic conductions of Li+, Na+, K+, Cu+, and Ag+. The UCl3&#8208;type SSEs enable a stable prototype ASSLB capable of over 3000&#8197;cycles and high reversibility at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. Further exploration of the brand&#8208;new multiple&#8208;cation mixed chlorides is likely to lead to the development of advanced halide SSEs suitable for ASSLBs with high energy density.

         <title>Intermolecular Formal Cycloaddition of Indoles with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes by Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular formal cycloaddition of indoles with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes promoted by commercially available Lewis acids has been disclosed, allowing one&#8208;step rapid construction of rigid indoline polycyclic structures via a cascade nucleophilic addition and Mannich reaction process.







Abstract
Herein, we develop a new approach to directly access architecturally complex polycyclic indolines from readily available indoles and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) through formal cycloaddition promoted by commercially available Lewis acids. The reaction proceeded through a stepwise pathway involving a nucleophilic addition of indoles to BCBs followed by an intramolecular Mannich reaction to form rigid indoline&#8208;fused polycyclic structures, which resemble polycyclic indole alkaloids. This new reaction tolerated a wide range of indoles and BCBs, thereby allowing the one&#8208;step construction of various rigid indoline polycycles containing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloadditions of Indoles with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Indoline Fused Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes

         <dc:description>
A silver Lewis acid catalyzes dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutanes to afford indoline fused bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) bearing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers in high yields and with an opposite regioselectivity compared to the classical pathway.







Abstract
Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are becoming ever more important in drug design and development as bridged scaffolds that provide underexplored chemical space, but are difficult to access. Here a silver&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of indoline fused BCHs from N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutane precursors is described. The strain&#8208;release dearomative cycloaddition operates under mild conditions, tolerating a wide range of functional groups. It is capable of forming BCHs with up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers, achieving yields of up to 99&#8201;%. In addition, a scale&#8208;up experiment and the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts further highlighted the synthetic utility.

         <title>Synthesis of Neocaesalpin A, AA, and Nominal Neocaesalpin K

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoids neocaesalpin A, AA and nominal neocaesalpin K was achieved through use of a redox&#8208;flexible platform as key intermediate. We delineate an approach that enables novel late&#8208;stage oxidation of a furfuryl acetate under mild conditions to furnish the characteristic butenolide found in the neocaesalpins.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoid neocaesalpin A (1) is disclosed. At the heart of the synthesis lies an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that rapidly assembles the target framework from commercial materials. A carefully orchestrated sequence of oxidations secured the desired oxygenation pattern. Late&#8208;stage release of the characteristic butenolide occurred through a novel mercury(II)&#8208;mediated furan oxidation. Successful extension of the route allowed preparation of neocaesalpin AA (2) as well as nominal neocaesalpin K (3) and suggested structural revision of neocaesalpin K, leading to the hypothesis that the two are likely the same natural product with correct assignment as 2.

         <title>Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Fluoroaroylation for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Ketones</title>

         <dc:description>
An alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis is reported. The introduced strategy also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones have attracted significant attention as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Such compounds are generally accessed through trifluoromethylation of ketones. Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This strategy bypasses the use of expensive or sensitive trifluoromethylation reagents and/or the requirement for ketone pre&#8208;functionalization, thus enabling an efficient and general synthetic method to access &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted ketones. A wide variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.

A wide variety of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono- or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Electride Nature of Na&#8208;hP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Na&#8208;hP4 phase, a high pressure electride, contains clusters of eleven sodium atoms within which charge is localized. Quantum chemical calculations show that this build&#8208;up of interstitial charge stems from the overlap of pd hybrid orbitals on the sodium atoms comprising this cluster, resulting in the formation of a multicentered bond, increased density, and semiconducting behavior.







Abstract
Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards free&#8208;electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close&#8208;packed structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high&#8208;pressure electrides (HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na&#8208;hP4 HPE show that increasing density causes a 3s&#8594;3pd electronic transition due to Pauli repulsion between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the core. The large lobes of the resulting Na&#8208;pd hybrid orbitals point towards the center of an 11&#8208;membered penta&#8208;capped trigonal prism and overlap constructively, forming multicentered bonds, which are responsible for the emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na&#8208;hP4. These multicentered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is key for its stabilization under pressure.

         <title>Sulfonium Salt Reagents for the Introduction of Deuterated Alkyl Groups in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile deuterated reagents, namely, dn&#8208;alkyl sulfonium salts, dn&#8208;alkyl halides, a dn&#8208;alkyl azide, and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine, were prepared and used to efficiently introduce dn&#8208;alkyl groups into drug candidates and their analogues with complex skeletons. A liver microsomal metabolism study using 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone as a model compound revealed a significant deuterium kinetic isotope effect due to the installed d2&#8208;ethoxy group.







Abstract
The pharmacokinetics of pharmaceutical drugs can be improved by replacing C&#8722;H bonds with the more stable C&#8722;D bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms, which is a typical metabolic site for cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, the application of deuterated synthons is limited. Herein, we established a novel concept for preparing deuterated reagents for the successful synthesis of complex drug skeletons with deuterium atoms at the &#945;&#8208;position to heteroatoms. (dn&#8208;Alkyl)diphenylsulfonium salts prepared from the corresponding nondeuterated forms using inexpensive and abundant D2O as the deuterium source with a base, were used as electrophilic alkylating reagents. Additionally, these deuterated sulfonium salts were efficiently transformed into dn&#8208;alkyl halides and a dn&#8208;alkyl azide as coupling reagents and a dn&#8208;alkyl amine as a nucleophile. Furthermore, liver microsomal metabolism studies revealed deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in 7&#8208;(d2&#8208;ethoxy)flavone. The present concept for the synthesis of deuterated reagents and the first demonstration of a KIE in a d2&#8208;ethoxy group will contribute to drug discovery research based on deuterium chemistry.

         <title>Expanding the Range of Bioorthogonal Tags for Multiplex Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy with spectral phasor analysis enables the multiplex detection of bioorthogonal Raman groups in cells. Unmixing of the overlapping alkyne and deuterium signals together with the detection of metallacarboranes is reported within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum.







Abstract
Multiplex optical detection in live cells is challenging due to overlapping signals and poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise associated with some chemical reporters. To address this, the application of spectral phasor analysis to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for unmixing three bioorthogonal Raman probes within cells is reported. Triplex detection of a metallacarborane using the B&#8722;H stretch at 2480&#8211;2650&#8197;cm&#8722;1, together with a bis&#8208;alkyne and deuterated fatty acid can be achieved within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum. When coupled to imaging in the high&#8208;wavenumber region of the cellular Raman spectrum, nine discrete regions of interest can be spectrally unmixed from the hyperspectral SRS dataset, demonstrating a new capability in the toolkit of multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization of Complementary Aromatic Oligoamide Strands in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various aromatic oligoamide strands were designed to self&#8208;assemble as homomeric double helices in water. We found that chemically inequivalent aromatic strands were able to hybridize selectively and quantitatively to form heteromeric double helices. The steric effects in the double helix cavity were found to be the main reason explaining the high selectivity of the hybridization.







Abstract
We prepared a series of water&#8208;soluble aromatic oligoamide sequences all composed of a segment prone to form a single helix and a segment prone to dimerize into a double helix. These sequences exclusively assemble as antiparallel duplexes. The modification of the duplex inner rim by varying the nature of the substituents borne by the aromatic monomers allowed us to identify sequences that can hybridize by combining two chemically different strands, with high affinity and complete selectivity in water. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the expected antiparallel configuration of the duplexes whereas NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry allowed us to assess precisely the extent of the hybridization. The hybridization kinetics of the aromatic strands was shown to depend on both the nature of the substituents responsible for strand complementarity and the length of the aromatic strand. These results highlight the great potential of aromatic hetero&#8208;duplex as a tool to construct non&#8208;symmetrical dynamic supramolecular assemblies.

         <dc:description>
A carbonyl&#8208;free metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis protocol facilitates heteromultimetallic complex formation. Bridging hydride ligands, originating from both an arene C&#8722;H activation event and H&#8208;atom transfer from solvent, stabilize unusual Cu&#8722;Ta bimetallics.

We employ a metal&#8208;metal salt metathesis strategy to access low&#8208;valent tantalum&#8208;copper heterometallic architectures (Ta&#8722;&#956;2&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu and Ta&#8722;&#956;3&#8208;H2&#8722;Cu3) that emulate structural elements proposed for surface alloyed nanomaterials. Whereas cluster assembly with carbonylmetalates is well precedented, the use of the corresponding polyarene transition metal anions is underexplored, despite recognition of these highly reactive fragments as storable sources of atomic Mn&#8722;. Our application of this strategy provides structurally unique early&#8208;late bimetallic species. These complexes incorporate bridging hydride ligands during their syntheses, the origin of which is elucidated via detailed isotopic labelling studies. Modification of ancillary ligand sterics and electronics alters the mechanism of bimetallic assembly; a trinuclear complex resulting from dinuclear C&#8722;H activation is demonstrated as an intermediate en route to formation of the bimetallic. Further validating the promise of this rational, bottom&#8208;up approach, a unique tetranuclear species was synthesized, featuring a Ta centre bearing three Ta&#8722;Cu interactions.

&lt;p&gt;A carbonyl-free metal-metal salt metathesis protocol facilitates heteromultimetallic complex formation. Bridging hydride ligands, originating from both an arene C&#8722;H activation event and H-atom transfer from solvent, stabilize unusual Cu&#8722;Ta bimetallics. These complexes are suitable platforms for subsequent metathesis chemistry, affording a tetranuclear complex featuring a highly reduced TaCu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cluster.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Polynucleotide Brush Growth on DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel strategies allow for both spatial and temporal control of polynucleotide brush modification on DNA origami through activation and regeneration of initiation sites using restriction enzymes in combination with TdT&#8208;catalyzed enzymatic polymerization. Spatiotemporal control of brush growth provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications ranging from drug delivery to supracolloidal assembly.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides an approach to create precise, tunable, and biocompatible nanostructures for biomedical applications. However, the stability of these structures is severely compromised in biological milieu due to their fast degradation by nucleases. Recently, we showed how enzymatic polymerization could be harnessed to grow polynucleotide brushes of tunable length and location on the surface of DNA origami nanostructures, which greatly enhances their nuclease stability. Here, we report on strategies that allow for both spatial and temporal control over polymerization through activatable initiation, cleavage, and regeneration of polynucleotide brushes using restriction enzymes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes in a spatiotemporally controlled way provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications in drug delivery and supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Pushing Up the Size Limit of Boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;Acenes: Modular Synthesis and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA, B&#8208;[4,3]PA and B&#8208;[7,2]PA derivatives. This study not only enriches the scope of the [n,m]PA family but also provides a straightforward strategy of boron incorporation into zigzag edges of &#960;&#8208;extended PAs, which also enables precise modification of their physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) have recently attracted considerable attention considering their fascinating physical properties and chemical stability. However, the precise sole addition of boron atoms along the zigzag edges of PAs remains challenging, primarily due to the limited synthetic approach. Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped PAs (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA (1&#8201;a&#8208;2), B&#8208;[4,3]PA (1&#8201;b&#8208;2) and B&#8208;[7,2]PA (1&#8201;c&#8208;3) derivatives, through efficient intramolecular electrophilic borylation. Their chemical structures are unequivocally confirmed with a combination of mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, 1&#8201;b&#8208;2 exhibits an almost planar geometry, whereas 1&#8201;a&#8208;2 displays a distinctive bowl&#8208;like distortion. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of this series of B&#8208;PAs are thoroughly investigated by UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with DFT calculation. Compared with their parent all&#8208;carbon analogs, the obtained B&#8208;PAs exhibit high stability, wide energy gaps, and high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 84&#8201;%. This study reveals the exceptional ability of boron doping to finely tune the physicochemical properties of PAs, showcasing their potential applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Controllable Regiodivergent Alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Activated by Distinct Organometallic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters using distinct organometallic reagents has been developed. Mechanistic studies revealed that unique chelation patterns are essential in determining selectivity. This approach overcomes the drawbacks associated with coupling reactions through radical mechanisms, which commonly yield the classical products reacting through stable radical species.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(boronic) esters can be readily synthesized from alkylBpin precursors. Selective transformations of these compounds hold the potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization of the remaining C&#8722;B bond, leading to a diverse array of molecules. Currently, there are no strategies available to address the reactivity and, more importantly, the controllable regiodivergent functionalization of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters. In this study, we have achieved controllable regiodivergent alkynylation of these molecules. The regioselectivity has been clarified based on the unique chelation patterns observed with different organometallic reagents. Remarkably, this methodology effectively addresses the low reactivity of 1,3&#8208;bis(boronic) esters and bridges the gap in radical chemistry, which typically yields only the classical products formed via stable radical intermediates. Furthermore, the compounds synthesized through this approach serve as potent building blocks for creating molecular diversity.

         <title>Stereoselective Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;Diborylation of Alkynes with a Neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 Diboron Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylation of alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron reagent has been demonstrated. The transformation leads to the spontaneous introduction of two chemically easily distinguishable boryl groups at the same carbon center. This method finds applications in the controllable stepwise downstream functionalization of gem&#8208;diborylalkenes, as well as the one&#8208;pot synthesis of acylboranes.







Abstract
The incorporation of two distinct boryl groups at the same carbon center in organic molecules has attracted growing research interest due to its potential for facilitating controlled, precise synthesis through stepwise dual carbon&#8208;boron bond transformations. Here we report a method to access unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylalkene (UDBA) stereoselectively via the reaction of readily available alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8722;sp3 diboron reagent (NHC)BH2&#8208;Bpin (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Attributing to the chemically easily distinguishable nature of the sp2 and sp3 boryl moieties, controllable stepwise derivatization of the resultant UDBAs is realized. This process leads to various multifunctionalized olefins and organoborons, such as acylboranes, which are difficult to prepare by other methods.

Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific opening by the pendant nucleophile.







Abstract
Under acidic reaction conditions (TFA), deprotection of BocNR(OSO2R) reagents triggers intermolecular aminative cyclizations of alkenes equipped with pendant nucleophiles. The processes are predicated on a sequence of stereospecific intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by the pendant nucleophile. The method offers broad scope with respect to the nucleophile (N&#8208;, O&#8208; or C&#8208;based), alkene and cyclization mode, allowing the installation of two contiguous stereocenters under operationally simple conditions.

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Homoleptic Diphosphene Lead Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homoleptic diphosphene lead complex was synthesized through controllable degradation of P4 by a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized plumbylone which possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions. The diphosphene lead complex exhibits intriguing reactivity involving the delivery of Pb(0) to perform redox reaction with iminoquinone thus producing a cyclic plumbylene and undergoing a NHC&#8208;induced two&#8208;step phosphorus cation abstraction reaction.







Abstract
Due to their limited capacity for &#960;&#8208;backdonation, isolation of &#960;&#8208;complexes of main&#8208;group elements remains a great challenge. We report herein the synthesis of a homoleptic diphosphene lead complex (2) from the degradation of P4 with a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized Pb(0) complex. Structural and computational studies showed that 2 possesses significant &#960; bonding interactions between Pb atom and diphosphene ligands, which is reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal diphosphene complexes. Consistent with its unique electronic structure, complex 2 can deliver Pb(0) atoms to perform redox reaction with an iminoquinone to produce a cyclic plumbylene (4) and perform 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene (IMe2Me2) induced phosphorus cation abstraction to give an anionic PbP3 complex (6).

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dearomatization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective alkynylation of pyridine is reported. The reaction is enabled by StackPhos and proceeds with excellent regioselectivity (25&#8201;:&#8201;1), enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee), and yield (up to 99&#8201;%). Terminal alkynes with a wide range of functional groups work well in the transformation, including acetylene gas, paving the way for the use of these feedstock starting materials to rapidly access highly useful synthetic intermediates.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative alkynylation of pyridines is reported with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The synthetically valuable enantioenriched 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine products afforded are generated from the readily available feedstock, pyridine, and commercially available terminal alkynes. The three&#8208;component reaction between a pyridine, a terminal alkyne, and methyl chloroformate employs copper chloride and StackPhos, a chiral biaryl P,N&#8208; ligand, as the catalytic system. Under mild reaction conditions, the desired 1,2&#8208;addition products are delivered in up to 99&#8201;% yield with regioselectivity ratios up to 25&#8201;:&#8201;1 and enantioselectivities values of up to 99&#8201;% ee. Activated and non&#8208;activated terminal alkynes containing a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated. Even acetylene gas delivered mono&#8208;alkynylated products in high yield and ee. Application of the methodology in an efficient enantioselective synthesis of the chiral piperidine indolizidine, coniceine, is reported.

         <title>Reversible Boron&#8208;Insertion into Aromatic C&#8722;C Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Unprecedented formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via reversible boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes. The reaction mechanism was clarified to consist of sequential two electrocyclic reactions with E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety through a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.







Abstract
Formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of triarylboranes bearing an ortho&#8208;phosphino substituent (ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes). The borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives were fully characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses. The dearomatized products were demonstrated to undergo the reverse reaction in the dark at room temperature, realizing photochemical and thermal interconversion between triarylboranes and boron&#8208;doped bicyclic systems. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that sequential two electrocyclic reactions involving E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety proceed via a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.

         <title>Homolytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phosphine&#8722;Quinone&#8208;Based Radical Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;electron transfer processes between sterically demanding triarylphosphines and quinones of appropriate electron&#8208;accepting character were investigated. Depending on the steric demand of the phosphine, P&#8722;O coupled adducts or C&#8722;H bond activation products were obtained, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds stepwise via transient radical ion pairs







Abstract
Herein, we present the formation of transient radical ion pairs (RIPs) by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) in phosphine&#8722;quinone systems and explore their potential for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds. PMes3 (Mes=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reacts with DDQ (2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) with formation of the P&#8722;O bonded zwitterionic adduct Mes3P&#8722;DDQ (1), while the reaction with the sterically more crowded PTip3 (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) afforded C&#8722;H bond activation product Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2(DDQ)]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (2). UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopic studies showed that the latter reaction proceeds via initial SET, forming RIP [PTip3]&#8901;+[DDQ]&#8901;&#8722;, and subsequent homolytic C&#8722;H bond activation, which was supported by DFT calculations. The isolation of analogous products, Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2{TCQ&#8722;B(C6F5)3}]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (4, TCQ=tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) and Tip2P(H)(2&#8208;[CMe2{oQtBu&#8722;B(C6F5)3}]&#8208;4,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H2) (8, oQtBu=3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzoquinone), from reactions of PTip3 with Lewis&#8208;acid activated quinones, TCQ&#8722;B(C6F5)3 and oQtBu&#8722;B(C6F5)3, respectively, further supports the proposed radical mechanism.

     alt="Homolytic C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Phosphine&#8722;Quinone-Based Radical Ion Pairs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-electron transfer processes between sterically demanding triarylphosphines and quinones of appropriate electron-accepting character were investigated. Depending on the steric demand of the phosphine, P&#8722;O coupled adducts or C&#8722;H bond activation products were obtained, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies showed that the C&#8722;H bond activation proceeds stepwise via transient radical ion pairs
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we present the formation of transient radical ion pairs (RIPs) by single-electron transfer (SET) in phosphine&#8722;quinone systems and explore their potential for the activation of C&#8722;H bonds. PMes&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Mes=2,4,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reacts with DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone) with formation of the P&#8722;O bonded zwitterionic adduct Mes&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&#8722;DDQ (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), while the reaction with the sterically more crowded PTip&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Tip=2,4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) afforded C&#8722;H bond activation product Tip&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(H)(2-[CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(DDQ)]-4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopic studies showed that the latter reaction proceeds via initial SET, forming RIP [PTip&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[DDQ]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and subsequent homolytic C&#8722;H bond activation, which was supported by DFT calculations.

   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}]-4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;Q&lt;sup&gt;

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Inversion in Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of carbon nitride as a photocatalyst requires to understand its response to light and the nature of all the photoexcited species formed. Here we devise an original approach based on time&#8208;resolved magnetic resonance to provide the spin state, the energy and wavefunction delocalisation of carbon nitride photoexcited states. We directly measure the energy of the triplet state and demonstrate that it is higher than the corresponding singlet.







Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved EPR (TR&#8208;EPR) demonstrates the formation of well&#8208;defined spin triplet excitons in carbon nitride. This permits to experimentally probe the extent of the triplet wavefunction which delocalizes over several tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the TR&#8208;EPR signal reveals the mobility of the triplet excitons. By employing monochromatic light excitation in the range 430&#8211;600&#8197;nm, the energy of the spin triplet is estimated to be &#8776;0.2&#8197;eV above the conduction band edge, proving that the triplet exciton lies above the corresponding singlet. Comparison between amorphous and graphitic forms establishes the singlet&#8208;triplet inversion as a general feature of carbon nitride materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Optimization of Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining high&#8208;throughput experimentation and machine learning technologies, we developed the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dimerization of two sulfoxonium ylides, leading to various unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes. Excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility under mild conditions enable this protocol to be of practical significance. A machine learning model for yield prediction further demonstrated its utilities and generalities.







Abstract
A novel and convenient approach that combines high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve the first selective cross&#8208;dimerization of sulfoxonium ylides via iridium catalysis is presented. A variety of valuable amide&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, ester&#8208;, and N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes are synthesized in good yields with high stereoselectivities. This mild method avoids the use of diazo compounds and is characterized by simple operation, high step&#8208;economy, and excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. The combined experimental and computational studies identify an amide&#8208;sulfoxonium ylide as a carbene precursor. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the reaction space is also performed (600 reactions) and a machine learning model for reaction yield prediction has been constructed.

         <title>Polymer Photocatalysts Containing Segregated &#960;&#8208;Conjugation Units with Electron&#8208;Trap Activity for Efficient Natural&#8208;light&#8208;driven Bacterial Inactivation</title>

Discontinuously conjugated photocatalysts with electron trap are effective for natural light&#8208;induced bacteria inactivation. A low&#8208;toxicity photocatalyst with an electron&#8208;trap was actively assembled by using ethylenediamine and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride via a bottom&#8208;up acidification strategy. The obtained material (EDA&#8208;PTDA) exhibited a superior performance for photocatalytic antibacterial under natural light.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient and metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for bacterial inactivation under natural light is a major challenge in photocatalytic antibiosis. Herein, we developed an acidizing solvent&#8208;thermal approach for inserting a non&#8208;conjugated ethylenediamine segment into the conjugated planes of 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene tetracarboxylic anhydride to generate a photocatalyst containing segregated &#960;&#8208;conjugation units (EDA&#8208;PTCDA). Under natural light, EDA&#8208;PTCDA achieved 99.9&#8201;% inactivation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (60 and 45&#8197;min), which is the highest efficiency among all the natural light antibacterial reports. The difference in the surface potential and excited charge density corroborated the possibility of a built&#8208;in electron&#8208;trap effect of the non&#8208;conjugated segments of EDA&#8208;PTCDA, thus forming a highly active EDA&#8208;PTDA/bacteria interface. In addition, EDA&#8208;PTCDA exhibited negligible toxicity and damage to normal tissue cells. This catalyst provides a new opportunity for photocatalytic antibiosis under natural light conditions.

         <title>A High&#8208;Affinity &#8220;Synthavidin&#8221; Receptor for Squaraine Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocyclic host binds squaraine dyes with exceptional affinity and selectivity in water, forming stable complexes showing near&#8208;IR fluorescence. These properties suggest application as a &#8220;supramolecular glue&#8221;, complementing the widely used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin pairing.







Abstract
Strong&#8208;binding host&#8211;guest pairings in aqueous media have potential as &#8220;supramolecular glues&#8221; in biomedical techniques, complementing the widely&#8208;used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin combination. We have previously found that squaraine dyes are bound very strongly by tetralactam macrocycles possessing anthracenyl units as cavity walls. Here we show that replacing the anthracenes with pentacyclic 5,7,12,14&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraoxapentacene (TOP) units generates receptors which bind squaraines with increased affinities (around Ka=1010&#8197;m&#8722;1) and improved selectivities. Binding can be followed through changes to squaraine fluorescence and absorbance. The TOP units are easy to prepare and potentially variable, while the TOP&#8208;based receptor shows improved photostability, both in itself and in complex with squaraines. The results suggest that this system could prove valuable in the further development of practical &#8220;synthavidin&#8221; chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Strong-binding host&#8211;guest pairings in aqueous media have potential as &#8220;supramolecular glues&#8221; in biomedical techniques, complementing the widely-used (strept)avidin-biotin combination. We have previously found that squaraine dyes are bound very strongly by tetralactam macrocycles possessing anthracenyl units as cavity walls. Here we show that replacing the anthracenes with pentacyclic 5,7,12,14-tetrahydro-5,7,12,14-tetraoxapentacene (TOP) units generates receptors which bind squaraines with increased affinities (around &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and improved selectivities. Binding can be followed through changes to squaraine fluorescence and absorbance. The TOP units are easy to prepare and potentially variable, while the TOP-based receptor shows improved photostability, both in itself and in complex with squaraines. The results suggest that this system could prove valuable in the further development of practical &#8220;synthavidin&#8221; chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switchable Organocatalysis from N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Carbodiimide Adducts with Tunable Release Temperature
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 48, November 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts are used as thermally labile precursors for NHC organocatalysis with excellent temporal control. We introduce a new paradigm for controlling the reaction profile by using perturbations to the CDI &#8220;mask&#8221;, instead of the NHC. Three test reactions are compared to present practical considerations for designing and choosing appropriate masks.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful organocatalysts, but practical applications often require in situ generation from stable precursors that &#8220;mask&#8221; the NHC reactivity via reversible binding. Previously established &#8220;masks&#8221; are often simple small molecules, such that the NHC structure is used to control both catalytic activity and activation temperature, leading to undesirable tradeoffs. Herein, we show that NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (CDI) adducts can be masked precursors for switchable organocatalysis and that the CDI substituents can control the reaction profile without changing the NHC structure. Large electronic variations on the CDI (e.g., alkyl versus aryl) drastically change the catalytically active temperature, whereas smaller perturbations (e.g., different para&#8208;substituted phenyls) tune the catalyst release within a narrower window. This control was demonstrated for three classic NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions, each influencing the NHC&#8208;CDI equilibrium in different ways. Our results introduce a new paradigm for controlling NHC organocatalysis as well as present practical considerations for designing appropriate masks for various reactions.

         <title>Fully aromatic self&#8208;assembled hole&#8208;selective layer toward efficient inverted wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with ultraviolet resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet&#8208;induced degradation has emerged as a critical stability concern impeding the widespread adoption of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in the context of phase&#8208;unstable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films. This study introduces a novel approach by employing a fully aromatic carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer, denoted as (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;PhPACz), as a hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted wide&#8208;band gap PSCs. Incorporating a conjugated linker plays a pivotal role in promoting the formation of a dense and highly ordered HSL on substrates, facilitating subsequent perovskite interfacial interactions, and fostering the growth of uniform perovskite films. The high&#8208;quality film could effectively suppress interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, improving hole extraction/transport efficiency. Through these advancements, the optimized wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, featuring a bandgap of 1.68 eV, attain an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.10%. Remarkably, MeO&#8208;PhPACz demonstrates inherent UV resistance and heightened UV absorption capabilities, resulting in a substantial improvement in UV resistance for the targeted PSCs. This characteristic holds significance for the feasibility of large&#8208;scale outdoor applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth in Radical Chemistry and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas indications of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds can be traced back to the 19th century, the preparation and characterization of both transient and persistent bismuth&#8208;radical species has only been established in recent decades. These advancements led to the emergence of the field of bismuth radical chemistry, mirroring the progress seen for other main&#8208;group elements. The seminal and fundamental studies in this area have ultimately paved the way for the development of catalytic methodologies involving bismuth&#8208;radical intermediates, a promising approach that remains largely untapped in the broad landscape of synthetic organic chemistry. In this review, we delve into the milestones that eventually led to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field of radical bismuth chemistry. Our focus aims at outlining the intrinsic discoveries in fundamental inorganic/organometallic chemistry and contextualizing their practical applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Main&#8208;chain Macromolecular Hydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazones &#8211; consisting of a dynamic imine bond and an acidic NH proton &#8211; have recently emerged as versatile photoswitches underpinned by their ability to form thermally bistable isomers, (Z) and (E), respectively. Herein, we introduce two photoresponsive homopolymers containing structurally different hydrazones as main&#8208;chain repeating units, synthesized via head&#8208;to&#8208;tail Acyclic Diene METathesis (ADMET) polymerization. Their key difference lies in the hydrazone design, specifically the location of the aliphatic arm connecting the rotor of the hydrazone photoswitch to the aliphatic polymer backbone. Critically, we demonstrate that their main photoresponsive property, i.e., their hydrodynamic volume, changes in opposite directions upon photoisomerization (&#955; = 410 nm) in dilute solution. Further, the polymers &#8211; independent of the design of the individual hydrazone monomer &#8211; feature a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) by close to 10 &#176;C. The herein established design strategy allows to photochemically manipulate macromolecular properties by simple structural changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement Enables A Triple Functionalization of&#160;Gem&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes: An Unusual Fluorolactonization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report in this paper a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory gem&#8208;fluorolactonization of ene&#8208;carboxylic acids. Reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (1.0 mol%) at room temperature affords fluorolactones in good to excellent yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Methylenecycloalkanyl)acetic acids are transformed to bridged fluorolactones under identical conditions. One C&#8208;C, one C&#8208;O and one tertiary C&#8208;F bond were generated along the gem&#8208;disubstituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in this operationally simple transformation. Trapping experiments indicates that the reaction is initiated by a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation followed by Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8208;F bond forming reductive elimination cascade. Post&#8208;transformations of these fluorolactones taking advantage of the electrophilicity of the 1&#8208;fluoroalkylcarboxylate function are also documented.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8208;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8208;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8208;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde&#8208;containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8208;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8208;O bonds are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sulfur Monoxide Surrogate Designed for the Synthesis of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfinylhydrazine reagent for the synthesis of organosulfur(IV) functional groups is reported. The reagent is readily prepared from commercial starting materials and is amenable to thermal &#8722;S(O)&#8722; transfer to dienes. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides is further demonstrated by exploiting this reagent as an &#8208;S(O)&#8208; donor.







Abstract
Sulfur monoxide (SO) is a highly reactive species that cannot be isolated in bulk. However, SO can play a pivotal role as a fundamental building block in organic synthesis. Reported herein is the design and application of a sulfinylhydrazine reagent as an easily prepared sulfur monoxide surrogate. We show facile thermal SO transfer from this reagent to dienes where a reaction using a mechanistic probe suggests the generation of singlet SO. Combined with Grignard reagents and appropriate carbon or nitrogen electrophiles, the reagent serves as an effective &#8220;SO&#8221; donor to enable the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides.

         <title>Uncovering a CF3 Effect on X&#8208;ray Absorption Energies of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; and Related Copper Compounds by Using Resonant Diffraction Anomalous Fine Structure (DAFS) Measurements
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; and other Cu&#8722;CF3 complexes are (re&#8722;)evaluated using resonant X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. A systematic trend was identified by which each additional CF3 ligand shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8211;3&#8197;eV, completely accounting for observed differences between complexes with different formal oxidation states. The recently debated assignment of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; as containing a Cu(I) ion is, thus, verified.







Abstract
Understanding the electronic structures of high&#8208;valent metal complexes aids the advancement of metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling methodologies. A prototypical complex with formally high valency is [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; (1), which has a formal Cu(III) oxidation state but whose physical analysis has led some to a Cu(I) assignment in an inverted ligand field model. Recent examinations of 1 by X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have led previous authors to contradictory conclusions, motivating the re&#8208;examination of its X&#8208;ray absorption profile here by a complementary method, resonant diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS). From analysis of DAFS measurements for a series of seven mononuclear Cu complexes including 1, here it is shown that there is a systematic trifluoromethyl effect on X&#8208;ray absorption that blue shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8211;3&#8197;eV per CF3, completely accounting for observed changes in DAFS profiles between formally Cu(III) complexes like 1 and formally Cu(I) complexes like (Ph3P)3CuCF3 (3). Thus, in agreement with the inverted ligand field model, the data presented herein imply that 1 is best described as containing a Cu(I) ion with dn count approaching 10.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Deaminative Arylation of Amino Acid Derivatives Assisted by Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light induced enantioselective deaminative arylation of amino acid derivatives by bifunctional copper catalysis is disclosed. A variety of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylamides are prepared with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity. A possible reaction mechanism and an asymmetric induction mode have been proposed based on experimental and computational evidence.







Abstract
The exploration of value&#8208;added conversions of naturally abundant amino acids has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. Compared with the well&#8208;established asymmetric decarboxylative transformation, the asymmetric deaminative transformation of amino acids still remains a formidable challenge, mainly due to the lack of effective strategies for the C&#8722;N bond activation and the potential incompatibility with chiral catalysts. Here, we disclose a photoinduced Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric deaminative coupling reaction of amino acids with arylboronic acids. This new protocol provides a series of significant chiral phenylacetamides in generally good yields and excellent stereoselectivity under mild and green conditions (42&#8211;85&#8201;% yields, up to 97&#8201;% ee). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations were performed to reveal the crucial role of additional phenols in improving catalytic efficiency and enantiocontrol.

Here, we disclose a photoinduced Cu-catalyzed asymmetric deaminative coupling reaction of amino acids with arylboronic acids. This new protocol provides a series of significant chiral phenylacetamides in generally good yields and excellent stereoselectivity under mild and green conditions (42&#8211;85&#8201;% yields, up to 97&#8201;% ee). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations were performed to reveal the crucial role of additional phenols in improving catalytic efficiency and enantiocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of the Core Chemistry of Self&#8208;Assembled Spherical Nucleic Acids on their In Vitro Fate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In physiological conditions, self&#8208;assembled spherical nucleic acids made from DNA amphiphiles encounter abundant serum proteins. Because they are held through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might disassemble, impacting their biological activity. Here, we investigate the biological fate of SNAs and the impact of core chemistry and stimuli&#8208;responsive crosslinking on their stability, providing guidelines for the biological applications of these self&#8208;assembled structures.







Abstract
Nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs), such as mRNA, small interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotides are extremely efficient tools to modulate gene expression and tackle otherwise undruggable diseases. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) can efficiently deliver small NATs to cells while protecting their payload from nucleases, and have improved biodistribution and muted immune activation. Self&#8208;assembled SNAs have emerged as nanostructures made from a single DNA&#8208;polymer conjugate with similar favorable properties as well as small molecule encapsulation. However, because they maintain their structure by non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might suffer from disassembly in biologically relevant conditions, especially with regard to their interaction with serum proteins. Here, we report a systematic study of the factors that govern the fate of self&#8208;assembled SNAs. Varying the core chemistry and using stimuli&#8208;responsive disulfide crosslinking, we show that extracellular stability upon binding with serum proteins is important for recognition by membrane receptors, triggering cellular uptake. At the same time, intracellular dissociation is required for efficient therapeutic release. Disulfide&#8208;crosslinked SNAs combine these two properties and result in efficient and non&#8208;toxic unaided gene silencing therapeutics. We anticipate these investigations will help the translation of promising self&#8208;assembled structures towards in vivo gene silencing applications.

Abstract
Here we report the use of a base metal complex [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe(OEt2)] (1&#8208;OEt2) (tBupyrpyrr22&#8722;=3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine) as a catalyst for intermolecular amination of Csp3&#8722;H bonds of 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (2&#8201;a) using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl phenyl azide (3&#8201;a) as the nitrene source. The reaction is complete within one hour at 80&#8201;&#176;C using as low as 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% 1&#8208;OEt2 with control in selectivity for single C&#8722;H amination versus double C&#8722;H amination. Catalytic C&#8722;H amination reactions can be extended to other substrates such as cyclohexadiene and xanthene derivatives and can tolerate a variety of aryl azides having methyl groups in both ortho positions. Under stoichiometric conditions the imido radical species [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{=N(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)] (1&#8208;imido) can be isolated in 56&#8201;% yield, and spectroscopic, magnetometric, and computational studies confirmed it to be an S = 1 FeIV complex. Complex 1&#8208;imido reacts with 2&#8201;a to produce the ferrous aniline adduct [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{NH(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)(C14H11)}] (1&#8208;aniline) in 45&#8201;% yield. Lastly, it was found that complexes 1&#8208;imido and 1&#8208;aniline are both competent intermediates in catalytic intermolecular C&#8722;H amination.

         <title>Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Low&#8208;Optical&#8208;Loss Carbazolyl Interconnecting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a high&#8208;quality hole transport layer, IC&#8208;CH, is developed by anchoring mixed carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules on optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals films for mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. The first evidence of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells based on all&#8208;SAMs HTL (without PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) is demonstrated, with efficiency as high as 28.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Combining wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) and narrow&#8208;band gap (NBG) perovskites with interconnecting layers (ICLs) to construct monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is an effective way to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, optical losses from ICLs need to be further reduced to leverage the full potential of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Here, metal oxide nanocrystal layers anchored with carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules (CHs), which exhibit much lower optical loss, is employed to replace poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) as the hole transporting layers (HTLs) in lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#8208;Sn) perovskite sub&#8208;cells and ICLs in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals (ITO NCs) layers are employed to enhance anchoring of CHs, while a mixture of two CHs is adopted to tune the surface energy&#8208;levels of ITO NCs. The optimized mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG perovskite solar cells demonstrate a high PCE of 23.2&#8201;%, with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A high PCE of 28.1&#8201;% is further obtained in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, with the highest Jsc of 16.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to date. Encapsulated tandem solar cells maintain 90&#8201;% of their reference point after 500&#8197;h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under 1&#8208;Sun illumination.

         <title>Controlling Electron Delocalization in Vanadium&#8208;Based Hybrid Bronzes through Molecular Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid vanadium bronzes are air&#8208;stable mixed&#8208;valence organic&#8211;inorganic metal oxides that can be synthesized under mild aqueous conditions and that show versatile optical and electronic properties. The degree of electron delocalization in this material platform can be controlled through molecular templation principles, allowing electronic conductivity to be tuned over six orders of magnitude.







Abstract
We show that the conductivity of hybrid vanadium bronzes&#8212;mixed&#8208;valence organic&#8211;inorganic vanadium oxides&#8212;can be tuned over six orders of magnitude through judicious choice of molecular component. By systematically varying the steric profile, charge density, and propensity to hydrogen bond across a series of eight diammonium&#8208;based molecules, we engender multiple distinct motifs of V&#8722;O connectivity within the two&#8208;dimensional vanadium oxide layers of a family of bulk crystalline hybrid materials. A combination of single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, variable&#8208;temperature electrical transport measurements, and a range of spectroscopic methods, including UV/Visible diffuse reflectance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, and electron paramagnetic resonance are employed to probe how vanadium oxide layer topology correlates with electron localization. Specifically, alkylammonium molecules yield hybrids featuring more corrugated layers that contain V&#8722;O tetrahedra as well as a higher ratio of corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing polyhedra and that exhibit highly localized electronic behavior, while alkyl bipyridinium molecules yield more regular layers with polyhedral edge&#8208;sharing that show substantially delocalized electronic behavior. This work allows for the development of design principles based on structure&#8211;property relationships and brings the charge transport capabilities of hybrid vanadium bronzes to more technologically relevant levels.

Specifically, alkylammonium molecules yield hybrids featuring more corrugated layers that contain V&#8722;O tetrahedra as well as a higher ratio of corner-sharing to edge-sharing polyhedra and that exhibit highly localized electronic behavior, while alkyl bipyridinium molecules yield more regular layers with polyhedral edge-sharing that show substantially delocalized electronic behavior. This work allows for the development of design principles based on structure&#8211;property relationships and brings the charge transport capabilities of hybrid vanadium bronzes to more technologically relevant levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicyclic Guanidine Promoted Mechanistically Divergent Depolymerization and Recycling of a Biobased Polycarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic depolymerization of poly(limonene carbonate) and related macromolecules is reported. The main degradation product, limonene carbonate, can be repolymerized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst providing a potential circular process. The mechanistic intricacies of this polymer depolymerization has been scrutinized in detail revealing the concomitant occurrence of complementary and unique degradation modes.







Abstract
We here report the organocatalytic and temperature&#8208;controlled depolymerization of biobased poly(limonene carbonate) providing access to its trans&#8208;configured cyclic carbonate as the major product. The base TBD (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) offers a unique opportunity to break down polycarbonates via end&#8208;group activation or main chain scission pathways as supported by various controls and computational analysis. These energetically competitive processes represent an unprecedented divergent approach to polycarbonate recycling. The trans limonene carbonate can be converted back to its polycarbonate via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst in the presence of an alcohol initiator, offering thus a potential circular and practical route for polycarbonate recycling.

         <title>Hybrid Superlattice&#8208;Triggered Selective Proton Grotthuss Intercalation in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid superlattice MnO2 is constructed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation, where it achieves the synergy of electron entropy increase, selective H+ Grotthuss intercalation, inhibited transfer of hydrated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ ions, all contributing to the high capacity, accelerated rate capability and high cycle stability of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.







Abstract
A great deal of attention has been paid on layered manganese dioxide (&#948;&#8722;MnO2) as promising cathode candidate for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) due to the excellent theoretical capacity, high working voltage and Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism. However, caused by the insertion of Zn2+, the strong coulomb interaction and sluggish diffusion kinetics have resulted in significant structure deformation, insufficient cycle stability and limited rate capability. And it is still far from satisfactory to accurately modulate H+ intercalation for superior electrochemical kinetics. Herein, the terrace&#8208;shape &#948;&#8722;MnO2 hybrid superlattice by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation (PVP&#8722;MnO2) was proposed with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs performance. Local atomic structure characterization and theoretical calculations have been pioneering in confirming the hybrid superlattice&#8208;triggered synergy of electron entropy stimulation and selective H+ Grotthuss intercalation. Accordingly, PVP&#8722;MnO2 hybrid superlattice exhibits prominent specific capacity (317.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.125&#8197;A g&#8722;1), significant rate performance (106.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1), and remarkable cycle stability at high rate (&#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention after 20,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A g&#8722;1). Therefore, rational design of interlayer configuration paves the pathways to the development of MnO2 superlattice for advanced Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Chemistry Governs Hierarchical Order of Charge&#8208;Complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet Peptide Coassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;assembly of charge&#8208;complementary peptides affords opportunities to create fibrillar biomaterials with molecular&#8208;level features that cannot be achieved in single&#8208;component systems. However, our ability to predict fibrillar network architecture based on peptide pair sequence characteristics is lacking. This report shows how the type of charged amino acid affects supramolecular organization in charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide co&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of proteinaceous biomolecules into functional materials with ordered structures that span length scales is common in nature yet remains a challenge with designer peptides under ambient conditions. This report demonstrates how charged side&#8208;chain chemistry affects the hierarchical co&#8208;assembly of a family of charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide pairs known as CATCH(X+/Y&#8722;) at physiologic pH and ionic strength in water. In a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, the CATCH(6K+) (Ac&#8208;KQKFKFKFKQK&#8208;Am) and CATCH(6D&#8722;) (Ac&#8208;DQDFDFDFDQD&#8208;Am) pair formed either &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich microspheres or &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich gels with a micron&#8208;scale plate&#8208;like morphology, which were not observed with other CATCH(X+/Y&#8722;) pairs. This hierarchical order was disrupted by replacing D with E, which increased fibril twisting. Replacing K with R, or mutating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal amino acids in CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6D&#8722;) to Qs, increased observed co&#8208;assembly kinetics, which also disrupted hierarchical order. Due to the ambient assembly conditions, active CATCH(6K+)&#8208;green fluorescent protein fusions could be incorporated into the &#946;&#8208;sheet plates and microspheres formed by the CATCH(6K+/6D&#8722;) pair, demonstrating the potential to endow functionality.

Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Acylimidazoles via Dehydrogenative Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron&#8208;based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The direct &#945;-alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron-based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross-coupling of 2-acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N&#162;-dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99% ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88% yield).

         <title>Multi&#8208;d Electron Synergy in LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu Intermetallics Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fact that d&#8208;band center theory links the d electron structure of transition metals to their catalytic activity, it is yet unknown how the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons impacts catalytic performance. Herein, novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics containing 5d, 4d, and 3d electrons were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity. The optimized LaNi0.5Co0.5Ru has an overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Beyond offering a variety of new electrocatalysts, this work reveals the multi&#8208;d electron synergy in promoting catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2) Annulation of 4&#8208;Acetoxy Allenoate with Aldimine Enabled by AgF&#8208;Assisted P(III)/P(V) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine with the assistance of AgF is described. The success of this reaction hinges on the metathesis between enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion and AgF, leading to a key intermediate comprising silver enolate and fluorophosphorane P(V)&#8208;moiety. The former is able to undergo Mannich reaction with aldimine while the latter initiates a cascade sequence of AcO&#8208;elimination/aza&#8208;addition, thus furnishing the P(III)/P(V) catalysis. By taking advantage of the silver enolate, a preliminary attempt at asymmetric variant was conducted with the combination of achiral phosphine catalyst and chiral bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine ligand (PyBox), giving moderate enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Oxide as A New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) offers an efficient and sustainable approach for direct conversion of widespread nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrate (NO3&#8208;) under mild conditions, representing a promising alternative to the traditional approach that involves harsh Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald oxidation processes. Unfortunately, due to the weak absorption/activation of N2 and the competitive oxygen evolution reaction, the kinetics of NOR process is extremely sluggish accompanied with low Faradaic efficiencies and NO3&#8208; yield rates. In this work, an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched perovskite oxide with nonstoichiometric ratio of strontium and ruthenium (denoted as Sr0.9RuO3) was synthesized and explored as NOR electrocatalyst, which can exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency (38.6%) with a high NO3&#8208; yield rate (17.9 &#956;mol mg&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). The experimental results show that the amount of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 is greatly higher than that of SrRuO3, following the same trend as their NOR performance. Theoretical simulations unravel that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 can render a decreased thermodynamic barrier toward the oxidation of *N2 to *N2OH at the rate&#8208;determining step, leading to its enhanced NOR performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well&#8208;established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8722;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C&#8722;aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross&#8208;electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An arylation protocol for pyridines is described, via the ring&#8208;opened Zincke intermediate. Treatment of pyridines with triflic anhydride and a secondary amine produces an azahexatriene species, which undergoes regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation at the putative C4 position. Recyclization then provides the pyridine products. Alternatively, metal&#8208;free arylation with a diaryliodonium salt is selective for the pyridine meta&#8208;position, affording a regiodivergent approach to pyridine biaryls from a common intermediate.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;CO2 battery has been considered as an ideal system for energy conversion and CO2 fixation. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of CO2 cathode and Mg anode. Here, a new amide mediated chemistry strategy is proposed to realize a highly reversible and high&#8208;rate Mg&#8208;CO2 battery in conventional electrolyte. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical computation unveiled that the introduced amide could simultaneously modify the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to accelerate CO2 cathodic reactions on the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic levels and facilitate the formation of Mg2+&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to enable highly reversible Mg anode. As a result, the Mg&#8208;CO2 battery exhibits boosted stable cyclability (70 cycles, more than 400 h at 200 mA g&#8208;1) and high&#8208;rate capability (from 100 to 2000 mA g&#8208;1 with 1.5 V overpotential) even at &#8208;15 &#8451;. This work opens a newly promising avenue for advanced metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self&#8208;assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl&#8208;based tetra&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L1) with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M12L16]24+ triangular orthobicupola structure (1). When flexibility is introduced into the ligand by the incorporation of a &#8208;CH2 group between the dipyridylamine and terphenyl rings in the ligand (L2) a unique [M8L24]16+ water&#8208;soluble &#8216;intertwined cubic structure&#8217; (2) results. The inherent flexibility of ligand L2 might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and unique 'intertwined cubic structure' in this scenario. This research showcases the ability to design and fabricate novel, topologically distinctive molecular structures via a straightforward and efficient approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of Early Atherosclerotic Plaques using a Sequence&#8208;Activated Fluorescence Probe for the Simultaneous Detection of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Transpeptidase and Hypobromous Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis is a lipoprotein&#8208;driven disease, and there is no effective therapy to reverse of atherosclerosis or existing plaques, therefore, it is urgently necessary to create a noninvasive and reliable approach for early atherosclerosis detection to prevent initial plaque formation. Atherosclerosis is intimately associated with inflammation, which was accompanied by excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cells requiring more glutathione (GSH) to resist severe oxidative stress. Therefore, the GSH&#8208;hydrolyzed protein&#160;&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and the ROS&#8208;hypobromous acid (HBrO) are potential biomarkers for predicting atherogenesis. Hence, to avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence&#8208;activated double&#8208;locked TP fluorescent probe, C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzed the probe. By utilization of C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, the voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing Doublet Intermediate&#160;Emitters by Chemically Crosslinking Confinement towards Spatiotemporal Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoluminescence is one of the most meticulous ways to manipulate light energy. Typical photoluminescent emitters are mostly stable substances with a pure photophysical process of spontaneous photon&#8208;emission from their excited states. Intermediate emitters are elusive attributing to their synchronous energy transfer process including photophysical and incomplete photochemical pathways. An intermediate emitter containing radicals is more difficult to be observed due to its inherent chemical reactivity. Here, these challenges are overcome by spontaneously formed space limitations in polymer crosslinking networks meanwhile chemically&#8208;active intermediates are captured. These doublet intermediates exhibit unique long&#8208;wavelength emissions under chemically crosslinking confinement conditions, and their luminous mechanism provides a novel perspective for designing intermediate emitters with liquid crystal characters and photoresponsive features towards spatiotemporal encryption, promising for the detection of photochemical reactions and the development of fascinating luminescent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving the High Capacity and High Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) based on Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three&#8208;dimensional foam&#8208;structured GaN&#8208;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high&#8208;performance SSB based on Co&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53 &#937; cm2 and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000 h at 0.1&#8208;0.2 mA cm&#8208;2. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200 cycles at 0.2C (~100%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96 mV/cycle to only 0.66 mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (~170mAh g&#8208;1 at 1C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte&#8208;based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance LRMO&#8208;based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high&#8208;energy density SSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensionally Arranged Quantum&#8208;Dot Superstructures Guided by a Supramolecular Polymer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit important photophysical properties, such as long&#8208;range energy diffusion, miniband formation, and collective photoluminescence, when aggregated into well&#8208;defined superstructures, such as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices. However, the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) QD superstructures, which have a simpler arrangement, is challenging; therefore, the photophysical properties of 1D&#8208;arranged QDs have not been studied previously. Herein, we report a versatile strategy to obtain 1D&#8208;arranged QDs using a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. SP is composed of self&#8208;assembling cholesterol derivatives with two amide groups for hydrogen bonding and a carboxyl group as an adhesion moiety on the QDs. Upon mixing SP and dispersed QDs in low&#8208;polarity solvents, the QDs self&#8208;adhered to the SP and self&#8208;arranged into 1D superstructures via van der Waals interactions between the surface organic ligands of the QDs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we revealed the efficient photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the 1D&#8208;arranged QDs via an in&#8208;depth analysis of the emission spectra and decay curves.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Barcoded Plasmonic Nanostructures for Activity&#8208;Based Protease Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a new class of protease activity sensors called DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes are comprised of gold nanoparticles functionalized with peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates (GPDs), where the peptide is a substrate of the protease of interest. The DNA acts as a barcode identifying the peptide and facilitates signal amplification. Protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage frees the DNA from the nanoparticle surface, which is subsequently measured via a CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based assay as a proxy for protease activity. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show activity&#8208;based, multiplexed detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;associated protease, 3CL, and the apoptosis marker, caspase 3, with high sensitivity and selectivity. GPDs yield &gt;25&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals, 100&#8208;fold improved response compared to commercial probes, and detection limits as low as 58 pM at room temperature. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of proteases can be detected visually by leveraging the aggregation&#8208;dependent color change of the gold nanoparticles. We showcase the clinical potential of GPDs by detecting a colorectal cancer&#8208;associated protease, cathepsin B, in three different patient&#8208;derived cell lines. Taken together, GPDs detect physiologically relevant concentrations of active proteases in challenging biological samples, require minimal sample processing, and offer unmatched multiplexing capabilities (mediated by DNA), making them powerful chemical tools for biosensing and disease diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in 2D Chalcogenides: Structural Origin and Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unusual set of anomalous functional properties of rocksalt crystals of Group IV chalcogenides were recently linked to a kind of bonding termed as metavalent bonding (MVB) which involves violation of the 8&#8208;N rule. Precise mechanisms of MVB and the relevance of lone pair of group IV cations are still debated. With restrictions of low dimensionality on the possible atomic coordination, 2D materials provide a rich platform for exploration of MVB. Here, we present first&#8208;principles theoretical analysis of the nature of bonding in five distinct 2D lattices of group IV chalcogenides MX (M: Sn, Pb, Ge and X: S, Se, Te), in which the natural out&#8208;of&#8208;plane expression of the lone pair versus in&#8208;plane bonding can be systematically explored.&#160; While their honeycomb lattices respecting the 8&#8208;N rule are shown to exhibit covalent bonding, their square and orthorhombic structures exhibit MVB only in&#8208;plane, withcationic lone&#8208;pair activating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane structural puckering that controls their relative stability. Anomalies in Born&#8208;effective charges, dielectric constants, Gr&#252;neisen parameters occur only in their in&#8208;plane behaviour, confirming MVB is confined strictly to 2D and originates from p&#8208;p orbital interactions. Our work opens up directions for chemical design of MVB based 2D materials and their heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Feature Shape and Dimension of a Confinement Geometry on Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local confinement effect, which can generate a high concentration of hydroxide ions and reaction intermediates near the catalyst surface, is an important strategy for converting CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon products in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, understanding how the shape and dimension of the confinement geometry affect the product selectivity is crucial. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the shape (degree of confinement) and dimension of the confined space on the product selectivity without changing the intrinsic property of Cu. We demonstrate that geometry influences the outcomes of products, such as CH&#8324;, C&#8322;H&#8324;, and EtOH, in different ways: the selectivity of CH4 and EtOH is affected by shape, while the selectivity of C2H4 is influenced by dimension of geometry predominantly. These phenomena are demonstrated, both experimentally and through simulation, to be induced by the local confinement effect within the confined structure.&#160;Our geometry model could serve as basis for designing the confined structures tailored for the production of specific products.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Salt Template Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Porous Carbon for Fast Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The water&#8208;soluble salt&#8208;template technique holds great promise for fabricating 3D porous materials. However, an equipment&#8208;free and pore&#8208;size controllable synthetic approach employing salt&#8208;template precursors at room temperature has remained unexplored. Herein, we introduce a green room&#8208;temperature antisolvent precipitation strategy for creating salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors to universally produce 3D porous materials with controllable pore size. Through a combination of theoretical simulations and advanced characterization techniques, we unveil the antisolvent precipitation mechanism and provide guidelines for selecting raw materials and controlling the size of precipitated salt. Following the calcination and washing steps, we achieve large&#8208;scale and universal production of 3D porous materials and the recycling of the salt templates and antisolvents. The optimized nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon (N&#8208;3DPC) materials demonstrate distinctive structural benefits, facilitating a high capacity for potassium&#8208;ion storage along with exceptional reversibility. This is further supported by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectra, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The anode shows a high rate capacity of 181 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 A g&#8722;1 in the full cell. This study addresses the knowledge gap concerning the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of porous materials, thereby expanding their potential applications for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Micro&#8208;Hydrophobic Effect Regulates Benzene Methylation in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 were identified by using solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations. The micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects induced by the local water molecules in ZSM&#8208;5 channels can drive the benzene molecules towards to surface methoxy species (SMS) to form the active SMS&#8208;Benzene complex, which promotes benzene methylation.







Abstract
Water is a ubiquitous component in heterogeneous catalysis over zeolites and can significantly influence the catalyst performance. However, the detailed mechanism insights into zeolite&#8208;catalyzed reactions under microscale aqueous environment remain elusive. Here, using multiple dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations, we establish a fundamental understanding of the role of water in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite under water vapor conditions. We show that water competes with benzene for the active sites of zeolite and facilitates the bimolecular reaction mechanism. The growth of water clusters induces a micro&#8208;hydrophobic effect in zeolite pores, which reorients benzene molecules and drives their interactions with surface methoxy species (SMS) on zeolite. We identify the formation and evolution of active SMS&#8208;Benzene complexes in a microscale aqueous environment and demonstrate that their accumulation in zeolite pores boosts benzene conversion and methylation.

         <title>Ultrapermeable Gel Membranes Enabling Superior Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane technology is rapidly gaining broad attraction as a viable alternative for carbon capture to mitigate increasingly severe global warming. Emerging CO2&#8208;philic membranes have become crucial players in efficiently separating CO2 from light gases, leveraging their exceptional solubility&#8208;selectivity characteristics. However, economic and widespread deployment is greatly dependent on the boosted performance of advanced membrane materials for carbon capture. Here, we design a unique gel membrane composed of CO2&#8208;philic molecules for accelerating CO2 transportation over other gases for ultrapermeable carbon capture. The molecular design of such soft membranes amalgamates the advantageous traits of augmented permeation akin to liquid membranes and operational stability akin to solid membranes, effectively altering the membrane&#8217;s free volume characteristics validated by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Surprisingly, gas diffusion through&#160;free&#8208;volume&#8208;tuned gel membrane undergoes a&#160;9&#8208;fold improvement without compromising&#160;separation factor for the superior solubility selectivity of CO2&#8208;philic materials, and&#160;CO2 permeability achieves a groundbreaking record of 5608 Barrer surpassing the capabilities of non&#8208;facilitated CO2 separation materials and exceeding the upper bound line established in 2019 even by leading&#8208;edge porous polymer materials. Our designed gel membrane can maintain exceptional separation performance during prolonged operation, enabling the unparalleled potential of solubility&#8208;selective next&#8208;generation materials towards sustainable carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Fused Dimerized Acceptor for Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency and High Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive "butterfly&#8208;like" structure, comprising two Y&#8208;acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene&#8208;based backbone. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and the electron&#8208;donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss, and elevating open&#8208;circuit voltage. These merits enable the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene&#8208;fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal&#8208;treated at 70 &#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600 hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A pyrene-fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive "butterfly-like" structure, comprising two Y-acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene-based backbone. The extended &#960;-conjugated backbone and the electron-donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low-lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non-radiative voltage loss, and elevating open-circuit voltage. These merits enable the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene-fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal-treated at 70 &#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600 hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly-like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The reaction behavior of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp* = C5Me5) towards carbenes and their heavier analogs was investigated.

         <title>Diphosphine Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chelate&#8208;Assisted Inner&#8208;Selective Migratory Hydroarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise control of the regioselectivity in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydrofunctionalization of alkenes remains a big challenge. With a transient ketimine directing group, the nickelcatalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones has been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source for the first time. The key to this success is the use of a diphosphine ligand, which is capable of the generation of a Ni(II)&#8208;H species in the presence of alkyl bromide, and enabling the efficient migratory insertion of alkene into Ni(II)&#8208;H species and the sequent rapid chain walking process. The present approach diminishes organosilanes reductant, tolerates a wide array of complex functionalities with excellent regioselective control. Moreover, this catalytic system could also be applied to the migratory hydroarylation of alkenyl azahetereoarenes, thus providing a general approach for the preparation of 1,2&#8208;aryl heteroaryl motifs with wide potential applications in pharmaceutical discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Carbonized Polymer Dots with Color&#8208;tunable Time&#8208;dependent Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Confining Carboxyl Dimer Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a facile strategy to realize fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color in time&#8208;dependent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is essential but both theoretically and practically rarely exploited. Through simultaneously confining carboxyl dimer association and isolated carboxyl into the particle via a simple hydrothermal treatment of polyacrylic acid, a dual&#8208;peak emission of red phosphorescence (645 nm) and green phosphorescence (550 nm) was observed from carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The ratio of the two luminescent species can be well regulated by hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl to promote hydrogen bond. Due to comparable but different lifetimes, color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP with color changing from yellow to green or orange to green were obtained. Based on the crosslinking enhanced emission effect, the phosphorescence visible time was even extended to 7 s through introducing polyethylenimide. This study not only proposes a novel and facile method for developing CPDs with color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP, but also provides a bran&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit and its definite structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Dormancy and double&#8208;activation strategy for construction of high&#8208;performance mixed&#8208;matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have the potential for energy&#8208;efficient gas separation by matching the superior mass transfer and anti&#8208;plasticization properties of the fillers with processability and scaling up features of the polymers. However, construction of high&#8208;performance MMMs has been prohibited due to low filler&#8208;loading and the existence of interfacial defects. Here, high MOF&#8208;loaded, i.e., 55 wt%, MMMs are developed by a &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; (DDA) strategy. High MOF precursor concentration suppresses crystallization in the membrane casting solution, realizing molecular level mixing of all components. Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double&#8208;activation was employed to induce MOF&#160;crystallization;&#160;the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO2 permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five&#8208;fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good &#160;CO2/N2 selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti&#8208;plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Piezocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water by Loading Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles on Graphitic Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is a green synthesis method, but the rapid complexation of charge carriers in piezocatalysts and the difficulty of adsorbing substrates limit its performance. Here, metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles are anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4) via hydrogen bond to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient H2O2 production. Experiments and theoretical calculations prove that MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 simultaneously optimize three key parts of piezocatalytic H2O2 production: i) the MOC component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8208;guest interaction and hinders the rapid decomposition of H2O2 on MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4, ii) the AuNP component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from g&#8208;C3N4 for O2 reduction reaction (ORR), iii) holes are used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) to produce O2 and H+ to further promote ORR. Thus, MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 can be used as an efficient piezocatalyst to generate H2O2 at rates up to 120.21 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in air and pure water without using sacrificial agents. This work proposes a new strategy for efficient piezocatalytic H2O2 synthesis by constructing multiple active sites in semiconductor catalysts via hydrogen bonding, by enhancing substrate adsorption, rapid separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and preventing rapid decomposition of H2O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Skeletons of Covalent Organic Framework for High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention as adsorbents for capturing and separating gold from electronic wastes. To enhance the binding capture efficiency, constructing hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps along the pore walls was one of the most widely adopted approaches. However, the development of absorbing skeletons was ignored due to the weak binding ability of the gold salts (Au). Herein, we demonstrated skeleton engineering to construct highly efficiently absorbs for Au capture. The strong electronic donating feature of diarylamine units enhanced the electronic density of binding sites (imine&#8208;linkage) and thus resulted in high capacities over 1750 mg g&#8722;1 for all three COFs. Moreover, the absorbing performance was further improved via the ionization of diarylamine units. The ionic COF achieved 90% of the maximal adsorption capacity, 1.63 times of that from the charge&#8208;neutral COF within ten minutes, and showed remarkable uptakes of 1834 mg g&#8722;1, exceptional selectivity (97.45%) and cycling stability. The theoretical calculation revealed the binding sites altering from imine bonds to ionic amine sites after ionization of the frameworks, which enabled to bind the AuCl4&#8211; via coulomb force and contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics. This work inspires us to design molecular/ionic capture based on COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Connecting Biological and Synthetic Approaches for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has developed into a broad field, spanning fundamental studies of enzymatic &#8216;model&#8217; catalysts to synthetic molecular catalysts and heterogeneous gas diffusion electrodes producing commercially relevant quantities of product. This diversification has resulted in apparent differences and a disconnect between seemingly related approaches when using different types of catalysts. Enzymes possess discrete and well understood active sites that can perform reactions with high selectivity and activities at their thermodynamic limit. Synthetic small molecule catalysts can be designed with desired active site composition but do not yet display enzyme&#8208;like performance. These properties of the biological and small molecule catalysts contrast with heterogeneous materials, which can contain multiple, often poorly understood active sites with distinct reactivity and therefore introducing significant complexity in understanding their activities. As these systems are being better understood and the continuously improving performance of their heterogeneous active sites closes the gap with enzymatic activity, this performance gap between heterogeneous and enzymatic systems begins to close. This convergence removes the barriers between using different types of catalysts and future challenges can be addressed without multiple efforts as a unified picture for the biological&#8208;synthetic catalyst spectrum emerges.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Synthesis of Nickel(0) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last fifty years, the use of nickel catalysts for facilitating organic transformations has skyrocketed. Ni(0) sources act as useful precatalysts because they can enter a catalytic cycle through ligand exchange, without needing to undergo additional elementary steps. However, most Ni(0) precatalysts are synthesized with stoichiometric aluminum&#8211;hydride reductants, pyrophoric reagents that are not atom&#8208;economical and must be used at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that Ni(II) salts can be reduced on preparative scale using electrolysis to yield a variety of Ni(0) and Ni(II) complexes that are widely used as precatalysts in organic synthesis, including bis(1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) [Ni(COD)2]. This method overcomes the reproducibility issues of previously reported methods by standardizing the procedure, such that it can be performed anywhere in a robust manner. It can be transitioned to large scale through an electrochemical recirculating flow process and extended to an in&#8208;situ reduction protocol to generate catalytic amounts of Ni(0) for organic transformations. We anticipate that this work will accelerate adoption of preparative electrochemistry for the synthesis of low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes in academia and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>High Gas Permeability in Aged Superglassy Membranes with Nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 Network Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superglassy membranes synthesised by polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) suffer from physical aging and show poor gas permeance over time, especially thin membranes, due to the fast rearrangement of nonequilibrium polymer chains. Herein, we constructed a novel PIM&#8208;1 thin film nanocomposite membrane (TFN) using nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (~10 nm)/carboxylated PIM&#8208;1 (cPIM&#8208;1) as the composite filler. Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 forms a stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation, and thus physical aging. Nanosizing of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 was achieved by regulating the nucleation kinetics using carbon quantum dots (CQD) during the synthesis. This led to increased surface area, and hence more functional groups to bond with cPIM&#8208;1 (via hydrogen bonding between &#8211;NH2 and &#8211;COOH), which also improved interfacial compatibility between the 3D network and polymer chains avoiding defect formation. As a result, the novel TFN showed significantly improved performance in gas separation along with reduced aging (i.e. ~6% loss in CO2 permeability over 63 days); the aged membranes had a CO2 permeance of 2504 GPU and selectivity values of 37.2 and 23.8 for the ideal CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 systems, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a method to reorganize the core structure of aliphatic unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates exploiting polyprotonation in superacid solutions. The superelectrophilic activation of N&#8208;isopropyl systems allows for the selective formal Csp3&#8208;H activation / cyclization or homologation / functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates. This study also reveals that this skeletal reorganization can be controlled through protonation interplay. The mechanism of this process involves an original sequence of C&#8211;N bond cleavage, isopropyl cation generation and subsequent C&#8211;N bond and C&#8211;C bond formation. This was demonstrated through in situ NMR analysis and labelling experiments, also confirmed by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiolation for Enhancing Photostability of Fluorophores at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes are essential for single&#8208;molecule imaging. However, their application in biological systems is often limited by the short photobleaching lifetime. To overcome this, we developed a novel thiolation strategy for squaraine dyes. By introducing thiolation of the central cyclobutene of squaraine (thio&#8208;squaraine), we observed a ~5&#8208;fold increase in photobleaching lifetime. Our single&#8208;molecule data analysis attributes this improvement to improved photostability resulting from thiolation. Interestingly, bulk measurements show rapid oxidation of thio&#8208;squaraine to its oxo&#8208;analogue under irradiation, giving the perception of inferior photostability. This discrepancy between bulk and single&#8208;molecule environments can be ascribed to the factors in the latter, including larger intermolecular distances and restricted mobility, which reduce the interactions between a fluorophore and reactive oxygen species produced by other fluorophores, ultimately impacting photobleaching and photoconversion rate. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of thio&#8208;squaraine probes in various imaging buffers, such as glucose oxidase with catalase (GLOX) and GLOX+trolox. We successfully employed these photostable probes for single&#8208;molecule tracking of CD56 membrane protein and monitoring mitochondria movements in live neurons. CD56 tracking revealed distinct motion states and the corresponding protein fractions. This investigation is expected to propel the development of single&#8208;molecule imaging probes, particularly in scenarios where bulk measurements show suboptimal performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50 years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutants cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#183;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180 nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3 times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.058 at 532 nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Isomerization in Radical Copolymerization of Benzyl Vinyl Ether with Pentafluorophenylacrylate Leading to Degradable AAB Periodic Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study revealed benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE) shows the peculiar isomerization propagation in radical copolymerization with an electron&#8208;deficient acrylate carrying pentafluorophenyl group (PFA).&#160; The comonomer pair inherently exhibits the cross&#8208;over propagation feature due to the large difference in electron density.&#160; However, the radical species of PFA was found to undergo a backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE pendant giving benzyl radical species prior to the propagation with BnVE.&#160; The isomerization brings a drastic change in the character of growing radical species from electrophilic to nucleophilic, and thus the isomerized benzyl radial species propagates with PFA.&#160; Consequently, the two monomers were consumed in the order of AAB (A: PFA; B: BnVE) and the unique periodic consumption was confirmed by the pseudo&#8208;reactivity ratios calculated by the penultimate model: r11 = 0.174 and r21 = 6600 for PFA (M1) with BnVE (M2). The pentafluorophenyl ester groups of the resulting copolymers are transformed into ester and amide groups via alcoholysis and aminolysis post&#8208;polymerization modifications. The unique isomerization in AAB sequence allowed the periodic introduction of benzyl ether structure in the backbone leading to efficient degradation under acid conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Domino&#8208;Redox Reaction Induced by An Electrochemically Triggered&#160;Conformational Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of a domino&#8208;type reaction has been applied in a wide range of fields such as synthetic organic chemistry, material engineering, and life science. To extend the domino concept to redox chemistry, we designed and synthesized a dimeric quinodimethane (QD) with a nonplanar dithiin spacer. The domino&#8208;redox properties can be activated by raising the temperature, based on a thermally equilibrated twisted conformation of QD, which has a higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level that is more readily oxidized. After one QD unit is oxidized (trigger), steric repulsion and electronic interaction between electrophores make the neighboring QD unit adopt a twisted conformation (domino process), which facilitates the following oxidation. Thus, a domino&#8208;redox reaction was achieved for the first time by a change in the HOMO level due to a drastic change in the molecular conformation.</dc:description>
