      <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Additives Electrolyte enables Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Rechargeable Li metal anode coupling with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is a promising tendency for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries exceeding 300 Wh kg&#8208;1. However, achieving long lifespan under realistic conditions remains a &#8220;Gordian knot&#8221; for practical&#8208;used cells because of the low Li reversibility and electrolyte exhaustion. Here, we report an advancing dual&#8208;additives electrolyte containing unique solvation structure of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane additives and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, which can generate the outer&#8208;Li2O robust solid electrolyte interface and F&#8208;,B&#8208;containing conformal cathode electrolyte interphase. The resulting stable ion transport kinetics enables excellent cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 for 140 cycles with 80% capacity retention under highly challenging conditions (~295.1 Wh kg&#8208;1 at cell&#8208;level). The electrolyte also exhibits high cycling stability for 4.6&#8201;V LiCoO2 (160 cycles with 89.8% capacity retention) and 4.95V LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode.</dc:description>

      <title>Recent Progress in PROTACs and Other Chemical Protein Degradation Technologies for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
      <dc:description>Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a group of diseases that cause neural cell damage, leading to motility and/or cognitive dysfunctions. One of the causative agents is misfolded protein aggregates, which are considered as undruggable in terms of conventional tools, such as inhibitors and agonists/antagonists. Indeed, there is currently no FDA&#8208;approved drug for the causal treatment of NDs. However, emerging technologies for chemical protein degradation are opening up the possibility of selective elimination of target proteins through physiological protein degradation machineries, which do not depend on the functions of the target proteins. Here, we review recent efforts towards the treatment of NDs using chemical protein degradation technologies, and we briefly discuss the challenges and prospects.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ&#160;Formation of Polymeric Nanoassemblies Using an Efficient Reversible Click Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;drug conjugates are promising as strategies for drug delivery, because of their high drug loading capacity and low premature release profile. However, the preparation of these conjugates is often tedious. In this paper, we report an efficient method for polymer&#8208;drug conjugates using an ultrafast and reversible click reaction in a post&#8208;polymerization functionalization strategy. The reaction is based on the rapid condensation of aryl boronic acid functionalities with salicylhydroxamates. The polymer, bearing the latter functionality, has been designed such that the reaction with boronic acid bearing drugs induces an&#160;  in situ  &#160;self&#8208;assembly of the conjugates to form well&#8208;defined nanostructures. We show that this method is not only applicable for molecules with an intrinsic boronic acid group, but also for the other molecules that can be linked to aryl boronic acids through a self&#8208;immolative linker. The linker has been designed to cause traceless release of the attached drug molecules, the efficiency of which has been demonstrated through intracellular delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: New Vistas at the Aggregate Level</title>
      <dc:description>
The importance of the whole picture: Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) research demonstrates that many properties and functions that are absent in molecular species can be found in molecular aggregates. AIE research thus emphasizes the significance of aggregate science in addition to molecular science for materials development.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) describes a photophysical phenomenon in which molecular aggregates exhibit stronger emission than the single molecules. Over the course of the last 20 years, AIE research has made great strides in material development, mechanistic study and high&#8208;tech applications. The achievements of AIE research demonstrate that molecular aggregates show many properties and functions that are absent in molecular species. In this review, we summarize the advances in the field of AIE and its related areas. We specifically focus on the new properties of materials attained by molecular aggregates beyond the microscopic molecular level. We hope this review will inspire more research into molecular ensembles at and beyond the meso level and lead to the significant progress in material and biological science.

      <title>Electrochemical Phase Evolution of Metal&#8208;Based Pre&#8208;Catalysts for High&#8208;Rate Polysulfide Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ evolution of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in defining catalytic reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003136), J.&#8208;Q. Huang and co&#8208;workers reveal the electrochemical phase evolution of metal&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts in working Li&#8211;S batteries that enables stable operation of high&#8208;rate and electrolyte&#8208;starved Li&#8211;S batteries. The general concept of electrochemically induced sulfurization is verified by thermodynamic energetics for most of low&#8208;valence metal compounds, which reshapes the understanding of polysulfide electrocatalysis and enlightens other catalytic reactions in aprotic electrochemistry.

      <title>Pigmentation Chemistry and Radical&#8208;Based Collagen Degradation in Alkaptonuria and Osteoarthritic Cartilage</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkaptonuria (AKU) is a rare genetic disease that leads to cartilage pigmentation and degradation, a symptom first reported by Rudolf Virchow of Charit&#233; Hospital in Berlin in 1866. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR and EPR spectroscopy, W.&#8197;Y. Chow, J.&#8197;A. Gallagher, H. Oschkinat, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000618) indicate a role for semiquinone radicals in the chemistry of the pigmentation process, and propose that transient glycyl radicals underlie the collagen degradation in this disease.

      <title>Identifying the adsorbed hydroxyl transfer kinetics as a descriptor of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The key descriptor that dominates the kinetics of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has not yet fully been identified so far. Herein, we isolate adsorption hydroxyl (OHad) transfer process (OHad + e&#8211; &#8596; OH&#8211;) and reveal its crucial role in promoting the overall kinetics of alkaline HER based on Ni/Co modified MoSe2 model catalysts (Ni&#8208;MoSe2 and Co&#8208;MoSe2) that feature almost identical water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption energies, but evidently different activity trends in alkaline (Ni&#8208;MoSe2 &gt;&gt; Co&#8208;MoSe2) and acidic (Co&#8208;MoSe2 &#8805; Ni&#8208;MoSe2) media. Experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that tailoring MoSe2 with Ni not only optimizes the adsorption of OHad, but also promotes the desorption of OH&#8211; and the electron&#8208;involved conversion of OHad to OH&#8211;, all of which synergistically accelerate the kinetics of OHad + e&#8211; &#8596; OH&#8211; and thereby the overall kinetics of the alkaline HER. The successful isolating and deeper understanding of OHad + e&#8211; &#8596; OH&#8211; as the critical descriptor of the alkaline HER, shed a new light for designing highly efficient alkaline HER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultrastable surface&#8208;dominated pseudocapacitive potassium storage enabled by edge&#8208;enriched N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>The development of ultrastable carbon materials for potassium storage poses key limitations caused by the huge volume variation and sluggish kinetics. Nitrogen&#8208;enriched porous carbons have recently emerged as promising candidates for this application, however, rational control over nitrogen doping is still challenging to further improve the long&#8208;term capacity fading. Here we propose a pyridine&#8208;coordinated polymer pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy for deliberate manipulation of edge&#8208;nitrogen doping and specific spatial distribution in amorphous high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbons, which shows an edge&#8208;nitrogen up to 9.34 at%, richer N distribution inside materials and high surface area of 616 m2 g&#8208;1 under a cost&#8208;effective low&#8208;temperature carbonization. The optimized carbon delivers unprecedented K&#8208;storage stability over 6000 cycles with negligible capacity decay (252 mAh g&#8208;1 after 4 months at 1 A g&#8208;1), rarely reported for potassium storage. In&#8208;depth analyses reveal high edge nitrogen, spatial distribution and high surface area together bring an impressive surface&#8208;dominated capacitive storage mechanism providing ultrastable performance.</dc:description>

Here we propose a pyridine&#8208;coordinated polymer pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy for deliberate manipulation of edge&#8208;nitrogen doping and specific spatial distribution in amorphous high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbons, which shows an edge&#8208;nitrogen up to 9.34 at%, richer N distribution inside materials and high surface area of 616 m2 g&#8208;1 under a cost&#8208;effective low&#8208;temperature carbonization. The optimized carbon delivers unprecedented K&#8208;storage stability over 6000 cycles with negligible capacity decay (252 mAh g&#8208;1 after 4 months at 1 A g&#8208;1), rarely reported for potassium storage. In&#8208;depth analyses reveal high edge nitrogen, spatial distribution and high surface area together bring an impressive surface&#8208;dominated capacitive storage mechanism providing ultrastable performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chiral CuxCoyS Nanoparticles under Magnetic Field and NIR Light to Synergistically Eliminate Senescent Cells</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, chiral Cu  x  Co  y  S nanoparticles (NPs) were developed to selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells using both an alternating magnetic field (AMF) and near infrared (NIR) photon illumination. The chiral effects on living cells were investigated, and  D  &#8208;Cu  x  Co  y  S NPs showed about 2.5 times higher of internalized ability than  L  &#8208;NPs. By modifying beta 2 macroglobulin (MG), senescent cells were effectively eliminated by  D  &#8208;Cu  x  Co  y  S NPs without damaging the activities of normal cells under AMF and photon illumination. Compared with the individual application of NIR illumination and AMF, their synergistic effect induced the production of caspase&#8208;3 with a much shorter treatment time and higher efficiency due to the more serious photon&#8208;induced cellular redox and mechanical damage of cellular skeleton. Moreover, the developed strategy was successfully used to remove senescent cells  in vivo  . This study developed a controllable way of regulating cell activities using chiral NPs, which will provide a valuable way for treating diseases and promoting health.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecularly tailored lithium&#8211;arene complex enables chemical prelithiation of high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes</title>
      <dc:description>Prelithiation is of great interest to Li&#8208;ion battery manufacturers to compensate for the inevitable loss of active Li during initial cycling of a battery that would otherwise degrade its available energy density. Nevertheless, none of the current strategies are suited for mass production due to lack of control, homogeneity, safety and scalability. Solution&#8208;based chemical prelithiation using a reductive chemical promises unparalleled reaction homogeneity and simplicity. Thus far, however, the applied chemicals of inadequate reducing strength have not succeeded in doping active Li in Si&#8208;based high&#8208;capacity anodes but merely formed solid&#8211;electrolyte interphases, leading to only partial mitigation of the cycle irreversibility. Here, we show that a molecularly engineered Li&#8211;arene complex with a sufficiently low redox potential drives active Li accommodation in Si&#8208;based anodes to grant ideal Li contents in a full cell. Fine control over the prelithiation degree and spatial uniformity of active Li throughout the electrodes are achieved by managing time and temperature during immersion, promising both fidelity and low cost of the process for large&#8208;scale integration.</dc:description>

      <title>Embedding Functional Biomacromolecules within Peptides&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanoarchitectures Enables Activity Enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>Rationally tailoring a robust artificial coating can enhance the life&#8208;time of the fragile biomacromolecules. However, the shrouded coating also can restrain the activity of the guest because of the decreased substrate accessibility. Herein, we report a peptides&#8208;directed strategy that enables to tailor the MOFs&#8208;shrouded biohybrids into controllable nanoarchitectures in&#8208;situ. The MOFs biohybrid is feasible to be shaped from different 3D microporous architectures to 2D mesoporous layer by a peptide modulator. Based on this mild strategy, we reveal that the nanoarchitectures of MOFs coating significantly affect the biological functions of the hosted biomacromolecules, and demonstrate that the biomacromolecules entrapped within the novel 2D mesoporous spindle&#8208;shaped MOFs (2D MSMOFs) can significantly boost their bioactivity compared with that entrapped within the hitherto explored 3D microporous MOFs, attributing to the shortened diffusion path and enlarged pore channel in 2D MSMOFs that facilitates the intercommunication for biotransformation. Meanwhile, the engineered 2D MSMOFs thin layer also can provide excellent protective effect on the hosted biomacromolecules or proteins&#8208;scaffolded biominerals through structural confinement.</dc:description>

      <title>The Six Isomers of the Cyclohexanol Dimer: A Delicate Test for Dispersion Models</title>
      <dc:description>The cyclohexanol homodimer is a delicate test model of the role of&#160;dispersion&#160;forces&#160;in intermolecular association. While phenol produces a single dimer, suppression of&#160;&#960;&#160;interactions&#160;and larger conformational flexibility&#160;in cyclohexanol results in multiple isomerism, as six competing dimers of the free molecule are observed in a supersonic jet expansion. Rotational spectroscopy reveals accurate structural data, specifically the formation of homo&#8208; and heterochiral diasteroisomers and the presence of both equatorial and axial forms in the dimers. Four dispersion&#8208;corrected density&#8208;functional molecular orbital calculations were tested against the experiment, with&#160;B3LYP&#8208;D3(BJ)&#160;offering good structural reproducibility with an&#160;Alrich&#8217;s triple&#8208;&#950;&#160;basis set. However, the prediction of the dimer energetics is largely model&#8208;dependent, offering a testbed for validation of&#160;dispersion&#8208;corrected&#160;computational models.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantum Dot&#8208;Catalyzed Photoreductive Removal of Sulfonyl&#8208;Based Protecting Groups</title>
      <dc:description>This communication describes the use of CuInS&#173;  2  /ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as photocatalysts for the reductive deprotection of aryl sulfonyl&#8208;protected phenols. For a series of aryl sulfonates with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, the rate of deprotection for the corresponding phenyl aryl sulfonates increases with decreasing electrochemical potential for the two electron transfers within the catalytic cycle. The rate of deprotection for a substrate that contains a carboxylic acid, a known QD&#8208;binding group, is accelerated by more than a factor of ten from that expected from the electrochemical potential for the transformation, a result that suggests that formation of metastable electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes provides a significant kinetic advantage. This deprotection method does not perturb the common NHBoc or toluenesulfonyl protecting groups and, as demonstrated with an estrone substrate, does not perturb proximate ketones, which are generally vulnerable to many chemical reduction methods used for this class of reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring ovarian cancer cell resistance to rhenium anticancer complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Rhenium tricarbonyl complexes have been recently investigated as novel anticancer agents. However, little is understood about their mechanisms of action, as well as the means by which cancer cells respond to chronic exposure to these compounds. To gain a deeper mechanistic insight into these rhenium anticancer agents, we developed and characterized an ovarian cancer cell line that is resistant to a previously studied compound [Re(CO)  3  (dmphen)(ptolICN)]  +  , where dmphen = 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and  p  tolICN =  para  &#8208;tolyl isonitrile, called TRIP. This TRIP&#8208;resistant ovarian cancer cell line, A2780TR, was found to be 9 times less sensitive to TRIP compared to the wild&#8208;type A2780 ovarian cancer cell line. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of established drugs and other rhenium anticancer agents in the TRIP&#8208;resistant cell line were determined. Notably, the drug taxol was found to exhibit a 184&#8208;fold decrease in activity in the A2780TR cell line, suggesting that mechanisms of resistance towards TRIP and this drug are similar. Accordingly, expression levels of the ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter P&#8208;glycoprotein, an efflux transporter known to detoxify taxol, were found to be elevated in the A2780TR cell line. Additionally, a gene expression analysis using the National Cancer Institute 60 cell line panel identified the  MT1E  gene to be overexpressed in cells that are less sensitive to TRIP. Because this gene encodes for metallothioneins, this result suggests that detoxification by this class of proteins is another mechanism for resistance to TRIP. The importance of this gene in the A2780TR cell line was assessed, confirming that its expression is elevated in this cell line as well. As the first study to investigate and identify the cancer cell resistance pathways in response to a rhenium complex, this report high&#8208;lights important similarities and differences in the resistance responses of ovarian cancer cells to TRIP and conventional drugs.</dc:description>

      <title>Performing Fuzzy DNA Strand Displacement Using Polymerases</title>
      <dc:description>Toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement offers DNA nanostructures with dynamic response capability.

We attribute this problem to toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement is an Exact Strand Displacement (ESD), where one invader strand corresponds to one specific substrate. In this work, we propose the Fuzzy Strand Displacement (FSD), where one&#8208;to&#8208;many and many&#8208;to&#8208;one relationships are established between the invader strand and the substrate, to reduce the complexity. We have constructed four modules, Converter, Reporter, Fuzzy Detector, and Fuzzy Trigger, and demonstrate the capability of reducing complexity via a sequence pattern recognition network composed of such modules. Compared to ESD, the proposed FSD can measurably reduce the sequence designing complexity in similar sequences containing situations, and thereby extends the strand displacement designing methodology.</dc:description>

Exposing the crescent hydrogels to physiological concentrations of glucose leads to the production of a locally high concentration of H  2  O  2  inside the microgels&#8217; cavities, due to the catalytic action by GOX inside the gel matrix, which selectively killed 90% cancer cells entrapped in the microgel cavities without killing the cells outside.

      <title>Ag2Au50(PET)36 Nanocluster: Dimeric Assembly of Au25(PET)18 Enabled by Silver Atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Assembly of atomically precise metal nanoclusters is now in the research spotlight, which offers exciting opportunities to gain fundamental insights into the hierarchical assembly of nanoparticles. However, it is still extremely challenging for controllable assembly of individual nanoclusters at a molecular&#8208; or atomic&#8208;level. Herein we report the dimeric assembly of Au25(PET)18  (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol), where two Au25(PET)18  monomers are bridged together by two Ag atoms to form the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer. The Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is an exclusive mesomer, which has not been found in any other chiral metal nanoclusters belonging to the racemic category. Furthermore, the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer is distinct from the Au25(PET)18  monomer on the optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. This study is expected to provide a feasible strategy to precisely modulate the assembly of metal nanoclusters with controllable structures and properties.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Assembly of atomically precise metal nanoclusters is now in the research spotlight, which offers exciting opportunities to gain fundamental insights into the hierarchical assembly of nanoparticles. However, it is still extremely challenging for controllable assembly of individual nanoclusters at a molecular&#8208; or atomic&#8208;level. Herein we report the dimeric assembly of Au25(PET)18  (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol), where two Au25(PET)18  monomers are bridged together by two Ag atoms to form the Ag2Au50(PET)36  dimer.

      <title>DNA&#8208;Edited Ligand Positioning on Red Blood Cells to Enable Optimized T Cell Activation for Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Artificial antigen presenting cells (APCs) with surface&#8208;anchored T cell activating ligands hold great potential in adoptive immunotherapy. However, it remains challenging to precisely control the ligand positioning on those platforms via conventional bioconjugation chemistry. Here, utilizing DNA&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly, we are able to precisely control both lateral and vertical distribution of T cell activation ligands on red blood cells (RBCs). It is found that the clustered lateral positioning of peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on RBCs with a short vertical distance to the cell membrane would be favorable for more effective T cell activation, likely owing to their better mimic of natural APCs. Such optimized RBC&#8208;based artificial APCs can stimulate T cell proliferation in vivo and effectively inhibit tumor growth via adoptive immunotherapy. DNA technology is thus a unique tool to precisely engineer the cell membrane interface and tune cell&#8208;cell interactions, promising for a wide range of applications including immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Nanolithography Enables Highly Ordered Recognition Interface in Microfluidic Chip for Efficient Capture and Release of Circulating Tumor Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Microfluidic chip with nano&#8208;scale structures has shown great potential, but the fabrication and cost issues restrict its application. Here, we propose a conceptually new &#8220;DNA nanolithography in microfluidic chip&#8221; by using sub&#8208;10 nm three&#8208;dimensional DNA structures (TDNs) as frameworks with a pendant aptamer at the top vertex (ApTDN&#8208;Chip). The nano&#8208;scale framework ensures the aptamer with a highly ordered upright orientation, avoiding the undesired orientation or crowding effects caused by conventional microfluidic interface fabrication processes. Compared with a monovalent aptamer modified chip, the capture efficiency of ApTDN&#8208;Chip was enhanced nearly 60% due to the highly precise dimension and rigid framework of TDNs. In addition, the confined tetrahedral nanostructure scaffolds make DNase I more accessible to aptamer with up to 83% release efficiency and 91% cell viability, which is fully compatible with downstream molecular analysis. Overall, &#8220;DNA nanolithography in microfluidic chip&#8221; provides a novel perspective to engineer nano&#8208;scaffolds to achieve a more ordered nano&#8208;topography of microfluidic chip.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation from CdTe Photoanodes Annealed with CdCl2</title>
      <dc:description>CdTe absorbs sunlight up to 830 nm and has the potential to promote efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, most CdTe photoanodes and CdTe photocathodes show positive and negative photocurrent onset potentials for water oxidation and reduction, respectively, and are thus unable to drive PEC water splitting without external applied biases. In this work, we enhanced the activity of a CdTe photoanode having an internal p&#8208;n junction during PEC water oxidation by applying a CdCl  2  annealing treatment together with surface modifications. The resulting CdTe photoanode generated photocurrents of 1.8 and 5.4 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 0.6 and 1.2 V  RHE  , respectively, with a photoanodic current onset potential of 0.22 V  RHE  under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G). The CdCl  2  annealing increased the grain sizes in this material and lowered the density of grain boundaries, allowing for more efficient charge separation. Consequently, a two&#8208;electrode tandem PEC cell comprising a CdTe&#8208;based photoanode and photocathode split water without any external bias at a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.51% at the beginning of the reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Rapid Capillary&#8208;Assisted Solution Printing of Perovskite Nanowire Arrays Endables Scalable Production of Photodectors</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to deliberately solution&#8208;print large&#8208;scale perovskite&#8208;based nanostructures represents a significant endeavor towards the convenient creation of a rich variety of optoelectronic materials and devices. Despite recent impressive progress in producing perovskite nanowires (NWs) for optoelectronics, it remains challenging to solution&#8208;print an array of NWs with precisely controlled position and orientation. Herein, we report a robust capillary&#8208;assisted solution printing (CASP) strategy to rapidly access aligned and highly crystalline perovskite NWs array. The key to the CASP approach lies in the judicious integration of capillary&#8208;directed assembly via periodic nanochannels and solution printing via the programmably&#8208;moved substrate to fast guide the deposition of perovskite NWs. The growth kinetics of perovskite NWs is closely examined by in&#8208;situ optical microscopy to scrutinize the perovskite crystallization. Intriguingly, as&#8208;printed perovskite NWs array exhibit excellent optical and optoelectronic properties, and can be conveniently implemented for scalable fabrication of photodetectors.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Multistability in an Anion Radical Pimer</title>
      <dc:description>Radical pimers are the simplest and most important models for studying charge transfer processes, and they provide deep insights into &#960;&#8208;stacked organic materials. Notably, radical pimer systems with magnetic bi&#8208; or multistability may have important applications in switchable materials, thermal sensors and information storage media. However, no such systems have been reported. Here, we describe a new pimer consisting of neutral  N  &#8208;(n&#8208;propyl) benzene triimide ([BTI&#8208;3C]) and its anionic radical ([BTI&#8208;3C]  &#8208;&#8226;  ), which exhibits rare magnetic multistability. The crystalline pimer was easily synthesized by reduction of BTI&#8208;3C with cobaltocene (CoCp  2  ). The transition occurs with a 27 K&#8208;width thermal hysteresis loop in the range of 170&#8208;220 K, accompanied by a smaller 25 K&#8208;width loop at 220&#8208;242 K. The magnetic multistabilty was attributed to the slippage of the &#960;&#8208;stacked BTI backbones and the entropy&#8208;driven conformational isomerization of the side propyl chains in the crystalline state during temperature variation. Our research demonstrated an unprecedented radical pimer showing magnetic multistability. The high diversity of the substituents on BTI provides great possibilities for designing multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Micromotors for Multiple Motile Sperm Cells Capture, Transport, and Enzymatic Release</title>
      <dc:description>An integrated system combining a magnetically&#8208;driven micromotor and a synthetized protein&#8208;based hyaluronic acid (HA) microflake is presented as a novel strategy for the in&#8208;situ selection and transport of multiple motile sperm cells (ca. 50). The proposed system appeals for targeted sperm delivery in the reproductive system to assist fertilization or to deliver drugs in scenarios where tens to hundreds of sperm are required for an effective therapy. The binding mechanism between the HA microflake and sperm rely on the interactions between HA and the corresponding sperm HA receptors, which are expressed on the sperm membrane when they are mature and with intact DNA. Once sperm are captured within the HA microflake, the assembly is trapped and transported by a magnetically&#8208;driven helical microcarrier. The trapping of the sperm&#8208;microflake occurs by a local vortex induced by the microcarrier during rotation&#8208;translation under a rotating magnetic field. After transport, the microflake is enzymatically hydrolyzed by local proteases, allowing sperm to escape and finally reach the target location.

      <title>Modular &amp; Selective Arylation of Aryl Germanes (C&#8208;GeEt3) over C&#8208;Bpin, C&#8208;SiR3 and Halogens enabled by Light&#8208;Activated Gold&#8208;Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Selective C  sp2  &#8208;C  sp2  couplings are powerful strategies for the rapid and programmable constructions of bi&#8208; or multiaryls. To this end, the next frontier of synthetic modularity will likely arise from harnessing the coupling space that is orthogonal to the powerful Pd&#8208;catalyzed coupling regime. This report details the realization of this concept and presents the fully selective arylation of aryl germanes (which are inert under Pd  (0)/  Pd  (II)  catalysis) in the presence of the valuable functionalities C&#8208;BPin, C&#8208;SiMe  3  , C&#8208;I, C&#8208;Br, C&#8208;Cl, which in turn offer versatile opportunities for diversification. The protocol makes use of visible light activation combined with gold&#8208;catalysis, which facilitates the selective coupling of C&#8208;Ge with aryl diazonium salts. Contrary to previous light/gold catalyzed couplings of Ar&#8208;N  2  +  , which were specialized in Ar&#8208;N  2  +  scope, we present conditions to efficiently couple electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;poor, heterocyclic and sterically hindered aryl diazonium salts. Our computational data suggest that while electron&#8208;poor Ar&#8208;N  2  +  readily couple with gold under blue light irradiation, there is a competing dissociative deactivation pathway for excited electron&#8208;rich Ar&#8208;N  2  +  , which requires an alternative photo&#8208;redox approach to enable productive couplings.</dc:description>

      <title>Strategies for the Syntheses of Pactamycin and Jogyamycin</title>
      <dc:description>Pactamycin and jogyamycin are aminocyclopentitol natural products, where each core carbon bears a stereodefined alcohol or amine moiety. Their structural complexity, coupled with the diversity of functional groups co&#8208;existing in a condensed space, make them fascinating synthetic targets in their own right. Pactamycin and its derivatives bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit and display activity against parasites responsible for drug&#8208;resistant malaria and African sleeping sickness; however, efforts to develop their therapeutic potential have been hampered by their cellular toxicity. Interestingly, bioengineered analogues display differences in selectivity and toxicity towards mammalian cells, spurring efforts to develop flexible strategies to thoroughly probe structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR), particularly in analogues lacking the C7 hydroxyl group of pactamycin. This review compares and contrasts approaches towards pactamycin and jogyamycin, including two successful total syntheses of the former. The implications of each route for preparing analogues to inform SAR and lead to compounds with increased selectivity for binding malarial over human ribosomes are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Multicomponent Organic Metal Halide Hybrid with White Emissions</title>
      <dc:description>Multicomponent single crystals have received great research attention for their capability of realizing multifunctionalities in a single phase material. Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids are an emerging class of ionically bonded crystalline materials, in which organic and metal halide ions co&#8208;crystallize to form neutral species. The rich choices of organic and metal halide components make 0D organic metal halide hybrids a highly promising platform for the development of multifunctional crystalline materials, which however are very much unexplored to date. Here we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a ternary 0D organic metal halide hybrid, (HMTA)  4  PbMn  0.69  Sn  0.31  Br  8  , in which an organic cation HMTA  +  (HMTA  +  : N&#8208;benzyl hexamethylenetetramium, C  13  H  19  N  4  +  ) co&#8208;crystallizes with multiple metal halide anions, i.e. PbBr  4  2&#8208;  , MnBr  4  2&#8208;  , and SnBr  4  2&#8208;  . The wide bandgap of the organic cation and distinct optical characteristics of three metal bromide anions enable a single crystalline &#8220;host&#8208;guest&#8221; system to exhibit emissions from multiple &#8220;guest&#8221; metal halide species simultaneously. The combination of these emissions could lead to a near&#8208;perfect white emission, with Commission Internationale d&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) of (0.32, 0.33), Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 95, and photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of around 73%. Due to distinct excitations of three metal halide species, warm to cool white emissions with Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) varying from 3237 K to 12730 K could be realized by controlling the excitation wavelength.</dc:description>

Here, we report the discovery of a 2D cationic aluminum oxyhydroxide JU&#8208;111 which sets a new benchmark for heavy metal oxyanion sorbents, especially for Cr(VI). Its structure is solved based on 3D electron diffraction tomography data. JU&#8208;111 shows fast sorption kinetics (~20 min), high capture capacity (105.4 mg g  &#8208;1  ), and broad working pH range (3&#8208;10) toward Cr(VI) oxyanions. Unlike layered double hydroxides (LDHs) that are poorly selective in the existence of CO  3  2&#8208;  , JU&#8208;111 remains excellent selectivity for Cr(VI) even in the presence of a large excess of CO  3  2&#8208;  . These superior features coupled with the ultra&#8208;low cost and environmentally benign nature make JU&#8208;111 a promising candidate for toxic metal oxyanions remediation as well as other potential applications alternative to LDHs.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable Surface Wrinkling by a Bio&#8208;Inspired Polyamine Anion Coacervation Process that Mediates the Assembly of Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Wrinkling desired: A bio&#8208;inspired assembly method renders spontaneous surface wrinkling on microsphere structures, in which the polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction, following the Hofmeister series, plays a critical role both in assembling polyoxometalate nanoclusters and tuning the surface buckling effects.







Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired method is used to render controlled wrinkling surface patterns on supramolecular architectures assembled from polyoxometalate (POM) clusters. It involves a polyamine&#8208;multivalent anion interaction generating positively charged coacervates, which while dictating the assembly of POM into spherical structures further facilitate an interesting surface morphogenesis with wrinkling patterns. This spontaneous surface wrinkling depends on the type of multivalent anion and the pH. As the polyamine&#8208;anion interaction becomes stronger, the wrinkles turn denser with lesser depth, which eventually undergoes post&#8208;buckling to engender a complex surface pattern. Interestingly, the order of influence exerted by different anions on the morphology follows the Hofmeister series. Moreover, the mild synthesis conditions keep the functional POM units dispersed in the sphere with a structural transformability to their lacunary form.

On the surface of it: Ligand&#8208;induced surface restructuring with heteroatomic doping is used to precisely modify the surface of a prototypical [Au25(SR1)18]&#8722; cluster while maintaining its icosahedral Au13 core for the synthesis of a new bimetallic [Au19Cd3(SR2)18]&#8722; cluster.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;induced surface restructuring with heteroatomic doping is used to precisely modify the surface of a prototypical [Au25(SR1)18]&#8722; cluster (1) while maintaining its icosahedral Au13 core for the synthesis of a new bimetallic [Au19Cd3(SR2)18]&#8722; cluster (2). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that six bidentate Au2(SR1)3 motifs (L2) attached to the Au13 core of 1 were replaced by three quadridentate Au2Cd(SR2)6 motifs (L4) to create a bimetallic cluster 2. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate a stronger electronic interaction between the surface motifs (Au2Cd(SR2)6) and the Au13 core, attributed to a more compact cluster structure and a larger energy gap of 2 compared to that of 1. These factors dramatically enhance the photoluminescence quantum efficiency and lifetime of crystal of the cluster 2. This work provides a new route for the design of a wide range of bimetallic/alloy metal nanoclusters with superior optoelectronic properties and functionality.

      <title>A Photoactivated Cu&#8211;CeO2 Catalyst with Cu&#8208;[O]&#8208;Ce Active Species Designed through MOF Crystal Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoactivated catalysis of the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide was achieved by using a catalyst with specified and homogeneously dispersed active species. The catalyst was designed through MOF crystal engineering and its integration of photothermal and photoelectric mechanisms realized the full utilization of solar energy with excellent stability.







Abstract
Fully utilizing solar energy for catalysis requires the integration of conversion mechanisms and therefore delicate design of catalyst structures and active species. Herein, a MOF crystal engineering method was developed to controllably synthesize a copper&#8211;ceria catalyst with well&#8208;dispersed photoactive Cu&#8208;[O]&#8208;Ce species. Using the preferential oxidation of CO as a model reaction, the catalyst showed remarkably efficient and stable photoactivated catalysis, which found practical application in feed gas treatment for fuel cell gas supply. The coexistence of photochemistry and thermochemistry effects contributes to the high efficiency. Our results demonstrate a catalyst design approach with atomic or molecular precision and a combinatorial photoactivation strategy for solar energy conversion.

      <title>Continuous and Segmented Semiconducting Fiber&#8208;like Nanostructures with Spatially Selective Functionalization by Living Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Uniform continuous and segmented semiconducting hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures of controlled length and composition consisting of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV core and P2VP coronas selectively decorated with diverse functional moieties were prepared by living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer of oligo(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP44), in which the basicity and coordinating/chelating ability of the P2VP segment provide a landscape for the incorporation of a variety of functional inorganic NPs. Through a self&#8208;seeding strategy, we were able to prepare monodisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles of OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP44 with lengths ranging from 50 to 800&#8197;nm. Significantly, the exposed two ends of OPV core of these fiber&#8208;like micelles remained active toward further epitaxial deposition of OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM49 and OPV5&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP44 to generate uniform A&#8208;B&#8208;A and B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B segmented block comicelles with tunable lengths for each block. The P2VP domains in these (co&#8208;)micelles can be selectively decorated with inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles as well as metal oxide coatings, to afford hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a versatile strategy toward the fabrication of narrow length dispersity continuous and segmented &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV&#8208;containing fiber&#8208;like micelles with the capacity to be decorated in a spatially selective way with varying functionalities.

&lt;p&gt;Fiber&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures are important components of flexible organic electronic and optoelectronic devices. To broaden the range of potential applications, one needs to control not only the length of these nanostructures, but the introduction of diverse functionality with spatially selective control. Here we report the synthesis of a crystalline&#8208;coil block copolymer of oligo(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenylenevinylene)&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (OPV&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P2VP&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;), in which the basicity and coordinating/chelating ability of the P2VP segment provide a landscape for the incorporation of a variety of functional inorganic NPs. Through a self&#8208;seeding strategy, we were able to prepare monodisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles of OPV&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P2VP&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; with lengths ranging from 50 to 800&#8197;nm. Significantly, the exposed two ends of OPV core of these fiber&#8208;like micelles remained active toward further epitaxial deposition of OPV&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;PNIPAM&lt;sub&gt;49&lt;/sub&gt; and OPV&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;P2VP&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; to generate uniform A&#8208;B&#8208;A and B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B segmented block comicelles with tunable lengths for each block. The P2VP domains in these (co&#8208;)micelles can be selectively decorated with inorganic and polymeric nanoparticles as well as metal oxide coatings, to afford hybrid fiber&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a versatile strategy toward the fabrication of narrow length dispersity continuous and segmented &#960;&#8208;conjugated OPV&#8208;containing fiber&#8208;like micelles with the capacity to be decorated in a spatially selective way with varying functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phosphorus Vacancies that Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Two Orders of Magnitude</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphorus vacancies have been created and their boosting effect to alkaline electrocatalytic HER is demonstrated. The nickel phosphide with phosphorus vacancies exhibits outstanding HER activity, kinetics, and stability that even outperform the Pt/C benchmark. DFT calculations suggest the greatly improved HER activity can be ascribed to the enriched electron density of Ni and P atoms near the vacancies.







Abstract
Vacancy engineering is an effective strategy to manipulate the electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their performance, but few reports focus on phosphorus vacancies (Pv). Herein, the creation of Pv in metal phosphides and investigation of their role in alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is presented. The Pv&#8208;modified catalyst requires a minimum onset potential of 0&#8197;mV vs. RHE, a small overpotential of 27.7&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 geometric current density and a Tafel slope of 30.88&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, even outperforms the Pt/C benchmark (32.7&#8197;mV@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 30.90&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). This catalyst also displays superior stability up to 504&#8197;hours without any decay. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations suggest Pv can weaken the hybridization of Ni&#8197;3d and P&#8197;2p orbitals, enrich the electron density of Ni and P atoms nearby Pv, and facilitate H* desorption process, contributing to outstanding HER activity and facile kinetics.

      <title>Divergent Strain&#8208;Release Amino&#8208;Functionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane with Electrophilic Nitrogen&#8208;Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrophilic nitrogen&#8208;radicals enable efficient strain&#8208;release amino&#8208;functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane. This radical reactivity can be used for the divergent assembly of 3&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamines, which are powerful aniline bioisosteres.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of a photocatalytic strategy for the divergent preparation of functionalized bicyclo[1.1.1]pentylamines. This approach exploits, for the first time, the ability of nitrogen&#8208;radicals to undergo strain&#8208;release reaction with [1.1.1]propellane. This reactivity is facilitated by the electrophilic nature of these open&#8208;shell intermediates and the presence of strong polar effects in the transition&#8208;state for C&#8722;N bond formation/ring&#8208;opening. With the aid of a simple reductive quenching photoredox cycle, we have successfully harnessed this novel radical strain&#8208;release amination as part of a multicomponent cascade compatible with several external trapping agents. Overall, this radical strategy enables the rapid construction of novel amino&#8208;functionalized building blocks with potential application in medicinal chemistry programs as p&#8208;substituted aniline bioisosteres.

      <title>Activating Pronucleophiles with High pKa Values: Chiral Organo&#8208;Superbases</title>
      <dc:description>
Superbase: This Minireview focuses on chiral organo&#8208;superbases as catalysts in asymmetric reactions of pronucleophiles with high pKa values. The performance of the organo&#8208;superbases, compared to conventional tertiary amine bases, is highlighted. The advantage of these new superbases lies in the opportunity to develop more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.







Abstract
Direct deprotonation represents an extremely simple, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economic strategy to activate pronucleophiles bearing an acidic proton. However, the difficulty often arises in activating pronucleophiles with high pKa values by using conventional chiral tertiary amines. To overcome this challenge, a handful of novel chiral Br&#248;nsted superbases, including amidines, guanidines, cyclopropenimines, and iminophosphoranes, have been discovered in recent years. This minireview focuses on the application of these organo&#8208;superbases in the catalytic asymmetric reactions of weakly acidic pronucleophiles, and highlights their comparison to the conventional tertiary amines, demonstrating the highly efficient deprotonation processes and stereoselectivity controlled conversions of the superbases. The advantage of these new superbases brings a great opportunity for developing more asymmetric transformations of weakly acidic pronucleophiles.

      <title>Coupling of Solar Energy and Thermal Energy for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: Status and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
A bundle of energy: The coupling of solar energy and thermal energy is a promising strategy to mediate the activity and/or selectivity of CO2 reduction. The status and prospects of this topic are reviewed, with the aim of providing guidelines for the design of new catalysts.







Abstract
Enormous efforts have been devoted to the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) by utilizing various driving forces, such as heat, electricity, and radiation. However, the efficient reduction of CO2 is still challenging because of sluggish kinetics. Recent pioneering studies from several groups, including us, have demonstrated that the coupling of solar energy and thermal energy offers a novel and promising strategy to promote the activity and/or manipulate selectivity in CO2 reduction. Herein, we clarify the definition and principles of coupling solar energy and thermal energy, and comprehensively review the status and prospects of CO2 reduction by coupling solar energy and thermal energy. Catalyst design, reactor configuration, photo&#8208;mediated activity/selectivity, and mechanism studies in photo&#8208;thermo CO2 reduction will be emphasized. The aim of this Review is to promote understanding towards CO2 activation and provide guidelines for the design of new catalysts for the efficient reduction of CO2.

      <title>Difunctionalization of Alkenes Involving Metal Migration</title>
      <dc:description>
Driving force: The difunctionalization of alkenes involving metal migration provides access to a new class of products that are not readily synthesized by other methods. This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the field, with an emphasis on the driving force for metal migration.







Abstract
The direct difunctionalization of alkenes, a cheap and abundant feedstock, represents one of the most attractive strategies for increasing molecular complexity in synthetic organic chemistry. In contrast with the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes, recent advances showcase alkene 1,n&#8208;difunctionalizations (n&#8800;2) involving metal migration is an emerging and rapidly growing area of research. This promising strategy not only opens a novel avenue for future development of alkene transformations, but also significantly expands upon the bond disconnections available in modern organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the migratory difunctionalization of alkenes, with an emphasis on the driving force for metal migration.

      <title>Fabrication of Heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 Nanocages with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages are fabricated through a facile synthetic approach. With the advantages of the novel hollow heterostructure, the well&#8208;defined FeTi2O5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages exhibit enhanced photoelectrochemical performance compared with TiO2 nanodisks, Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles, and Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Photocatalysts with well&#8208;designed compositions and structures are desirable for achieving highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Heterostructured semiconductor photocatalysts with advanced hollow structures possess beneficial features for promoting the activity towards photocatalytic reactions. Here we develop a facile synthetic strategy for the fabrication of Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 nanocages (NCs) as anode materials in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cells. A hydrothermal reaction is performed to transform MIL&#8208;125(Ti) nanodisks (NDs) to Ti&#8211;Fe&#8211;O NCs, which are further converted to Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NCs through a post annealing process. Owing to the compositional and structural advantages, the heterostructured Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NCs show enhanced performance for PEC water oxidation compared with TiO2 NDs, Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles (NPs) and Fe2TiO5&#8211;TiO2 NPs.

      <title>Electron Transfer in the Cs&#8834;{Mn4Fe4} Cubic Switch: A Soluble Molecular Model of the MnFe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogues</title>
      <dc:description>
Out of the blue: The Cs&#8834;{Mn4Fe4} cube, the first soluble molecular model of MnFe Prussian&#8208;blue analogues, is analyzed using X&#8208;ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements. Near room temperature, a spin&#8208;state change occurs which could be ascribed to a metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer.







Abstract
A mixed&#8208;valence {MnII3MnIIIFeII2FeIII2} cyanide&#8208;bridged molecular cube hosting a caesium cation, Cs&#8834;{Mn4Fe4}, was synthesized and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Cyclic&#8208;voltammetry measurements show that its electronic state can be switched between five different redox states, which results in a remarkable electrochromic effect. Magnetic measurements on fresh samples point to the occurrence of a spin&#8208;state change near room temperature, which could be ascribed to a metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer converting the {FeII&#8722;CN&#8722;MnIII} pair into a {FeIII&#8722;CN&#8722;MnII} pair. This feature was only previously observed in the polymeric MnFe Prussian&#8208;blue analogues (PBAs). Moreover, this novel switchable molecule proved to be soluble and stable in organic solvents, paving the way for its integration into advanced materials.

      <title>Cove&#8208;Edged Nanographenes with Localized Double Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Cove&#8208;edged, contorted nanographenes! Large&#8208;size nanographenes with a cove&#8208;type periphery and contorted structure were synthesized. They contain localized C=C double bonds (see picture, in purple) and they have a very different electronic structure to the all&#8208;benzenoid NGs.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis and electronic properties of two large&#8208;size cove&#8208;edged nanographenes (NGs), CN1 and CN2, are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals a contorted backbone for both molecules owing to the steric repulsion at the inner cove position. Noticeably, the dominant structures of these molecules contain four (for CN1) or six (for CN2) localized C=C double bonds embedded in nine (for CN1) or twelve (for CN2) aromatic sextet rings according to Clar's formula, which is supported by bond length analysis and theoretical (NICS, ACID) calculations. Furthermore, Raman spectra exhibit a band associated with the longitudinal CC stretching mode of olefinic double bonds. Owing to the existence of the additional olefinic bonds, both compounds show a small band gap (1.84&#8197;eV for CN1 and 1.37&#8197;eV for CN2). They also display moderate fluorescence quantum yield (35&#8201;% for CN1 and 50&#8201;% for CN2) owing to the contorted geometry, which can suppress aggregation in solution.

      <title>On the Binding of Congo Red to Amyloid Fibrils</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperative labelling of amyloids: Congo red binds to amyloid fibrils with the long axis oblique to the fibril axis and the plane radial to the fibril core, following a cooperative mechanism characterized by the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex.







Abstract
Amyloids are characterized by their capacity to bind Congo red (CR), one of the most used amyloid&#8208;specific dyes. The structural features of CR binding were unknown for years, mainly because of the lack of amyloid structures solved at high resolution. In the last few years, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy enabled the determination of the structural features of amyloids, such as the HET&#8208;s prion forming domain (HET&#8208;s PFD), which also has recently been used to determine the amyloid&#8211;CR interface at atomic resolution. Herein, we combine spectroscopic data with molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and excitonic quantum/molecular mechanics calculations to examine and rationalize CR binding to amyloids. In contrast to a previous assumption on the binding mode, our results suggest that CR binding to the HET&#8208;s PFD involves a cooperative process entailing the formation of a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. This provides a molecular basis to explain the bathochromic shift in the maximal absorbance wavelength when CR is bound to amyloids.

      <title>Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Deficient Corona[5]arenes and Their Selective Complexation with Dihydrogen Phosphate: Cooperative Effects of Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Let's cooperate! Diverse electron&#8208;deficient corona[3]arene[2]tetrazines were efficiently synthesized by coupling reactions and post&#8208;macrocyclization oxidation reactions. As electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles, they serve as powerful and highly selective receptors for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer of dihydrogen phosphate, forming the complexes through cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
Reported here are the syntheses, conformational structures, electrochemical properties, and noncovalent anion binding of corona[5]arenes. A (3+2) fragment coupling reaction proceeded efficiently under mild reaction conditions to produce a number of novel heteroatom&#8208; and methylene&#8208;bridged corona[3]arene[2]tetrazine macrocycles. Selective oxidation of the sulfur atom between two phenylene rings afforded sulfoxide&#8208; and sulfone&#8208;linked corona[5]arenes in good yields. All corona[5]arenes synthesized adopted similar 1,2,4&#8208;alternate conformational structures, forming pentagonal cavities. The cavity sizes and the electronic properties such as redox potentials, were measured with CV and DPV, and were influenced by the different bridging units. As electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles, the acquired corona[3]arene[2]tetrazines served as highly selective hosts, forming complexes with the hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer of dihydrogen phosphate through cooperative anion&#8211;&#960; interactions.

      <title>Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Ketones Mediated by Nickel(I) Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Squeezing in CO: NiI complexes can promote the carbonylative coupling of NiII&#8208;acyl complexes with primary and secondary iodides to provide a general method for accessing aliphatic ketones directly from carbon monoxide. The methodology is ideal for carbon isotope labeling and illustrated with examples for accessing carbon&#8197;13 and carbon&#8197;14 bioactive molecules.







Abstract
An extensive range of functionalized aliphatic ketones with good functional&#8208;group tolerance has been prepared by a NiI&#8208;promoted coupling of either primary or secondary alkyl iodides with NN2 pincer NiII&#8208;acyl complexes. The latter were easily accessed from the corresponding NiII&#8208;alkyl complexes with stoichiometric CO. This Ni&#8208;mediated carbonylative coupling is adaptable to late&#8208;stage carbon isotope labeling, as illustrated by the preparation of isotopically labelled pharmaceuticals. Preliminary investigations suggest the intermediacy of carbon&#8208;centered radicals.

      <title>An Indium&#8208;Seamed Hexameric Metal&#8211;Organic Cage as an Example of a Hexameric Pyrogallol[4]arene Capsule Conjoined Exclusively by Trivalent Metal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Zip it up: The formation of a pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC5)&#8208;based indium&#8208;seamed hexameric capsule is presented. The reaction involves stitching of 6 PgC5 macrocycles by 24 InIII ions to form the supramolecular structure.







Abstract
A hexameric metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule is assembled from pyrogallol[4]arene units, which are stitched together with indium ions. This indium&#8208;seamed capsule is the first instance of a M24L6 type hexameric coordination cage held together exclusively by trivalent metal ions. Explicitly, unlike previously reported pyrogallol[4]arene&#8208;based metal&#8208;seamed capsules, the current In3+ seamed capsule is entirely supported by O&#8594;In coordinate bonds. This work demonstrates the important proof of concept of the ability of pyrogallol[4]arene to react with metals in higher oxidation states to assemble into atomically&#8208;precise hexameric coordination cages. As such, these results open up exciting avenues toward the assembly of previously unanticipated metal&#8211;organic capsules, for example offering inspiration for tackling metals exhibiting high valence states such as in the lanthanide and actinide series.

A chiral electrochemically responsive molecular universal joint (EMUJ) was synthesized by fusing a macrocyclic pillar[6]arene (P[6]) to a ferrocene&#8208;based side ring. A single crystal of an enantiopure EMUJ was successfully obtained, which allowed, for the first time, the definitive correlation between the absolute configuration and the circular dichroism spectrum of a P[6] derivative to be determined. The self&#8208;inclusion and self&#8208;exclusion conformational change of the EMUJ led to a chiroptical inversion of the P[6] moiety, which could be manipulated by both solvents and changes in temperature. The EMUJ also displayed a unique redox&#8208;triggered reversible in/out conformational switching, corresponding to an occupation/voidance switching of the P[6] cavity, respectively. This phenomenon is an unprecedented electrochemical manipulation of the capture and release of guest molecules by supramolecular hosts.

      <title>Emission of toxic HCN during NOx removal by ammonia SCR in the exhaust of lean&#8208;burn natural gas engines</title>
      <dc:description>Reducing greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions is one of the most stringent priorities of our society to minimize their dramatic effects on health and environment. Natural gas (NG) engines, in particular at lean conditions, emit less CO  2  in comparison to combustion engines operated with liquid fuels but NG engines still require emission control devices for NO  x  removal. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO  x  with NH  3  , we evaluated the interplay of the reducing agent NH  3  and formaldehyde, which is always present in the exhaust of NG engines. Our results show that a significant amount of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is formed over typical NO  x  removal catalysts. All catalysts tested partially convert formaldehyde to HCOOH and CO. Additionally they form secondary emissions of HCN due to catalytic reactions of formaldehyde and its oxidation intermediates with NH  3  . Considering that with the present components of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system the HCN emissions are not efficiently converted to non&#8208;polluting gases, the development of more advanced catalyst formulations with improved oxidation activity is mandatory to solve this novel critical issue.</dc:description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Magic&#8208;Size Cluster Precursor Compounds into Ultrasmall CdS Quantum Dots with Enhanced Particle Yield at Low Temperatures</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;size CdS quantum dots are synthesized without the coexistence of the precursor compound and thus with enhanced particle yield. It is shown that after the formation of the precursor compound in the pre&#8208;nucleation stage, the addition of tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide facilitates the production of small&#8208;size QDs.







Abstract
Colloidal small&#8208;size CdS quantum dots (QDs) are produced usually with low particle yield, together with side products such as the particular precursor compounds (PCs) of magic&#8208;size clusters (MSC). Here, we report our synthesis of small&#8208;size CdS QDs without the coexistence of the PC and thus with enhanced particle yield. For a conventional reaction of cadmium oleate (Cd(OA)2) and sulfur (S) in 1&#8208;octadecene (ODE), we show that after the formation of the PC in the pre&#8208;nucleation stage, the addition of tri&#8208;n&#8208;octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) facilitates the production of small&#8208;size QDs. We demonstrate that TOPO fragmentizes the PC that have formed, which enables the nucleation and growth of small&#8208;size QDs even at room temperature. Our findings introduce a new approach to making small&#8208;size QDs without the coexistence of the PC and with improved particle yield. Providing experimental evidence for the two&#8208;pathway model proposed for the pre&#8208;nucleation stage of colloidal binary QDs, the present study aids in the advance of non&#8208;classical nucleation theory.

      <title>Using the Secondary PH/BH Functional Groups of an Active Geminal Frustrated Lewis Pair for Carbon Monoxide Reduction and Reactions with Nitriles and Isonitriles</title>
      <dc:description>
A P/B pair: The geminal secondary phosphane/borane (PH/BH) pair reduces carbon monoxide to a formaldehyde unit at the P/B template. Formaldehyde is liberated in a subsequent reaction. The PH/BH pair also reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine (not shown).







Abstract
Reaction of the secondary alkynyl(Mes*)PH phosphane 2 with (Fmes)BH2&#8901;SMe2 gives the geminal PH/BH frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) 3. The PH and the BH functions are jointly used in the reduction of carbon monoxide under mild reaction conditions to give the [P]&#8208;CH2&#8208;O&#8208;[B] product. A subsequent cycloaddition sequence results in the liberation of formaldehyde. The FLP 3 reacts with benzonitrile to give a P&#8208;benzamidine, and it couples two isonitriles at the FLP framework.
