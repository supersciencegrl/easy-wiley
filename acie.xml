         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Transfer Reductive Catalytic Fractionation of Lignocellulose: High Monomeric Yield with Switchable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin solubilization and in situ hydrogenolysis are crucial for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of lignocellulose to aromatic monomers. In this study, we reported a typical hydrogen bond acceptor of choline chloride (ChCl) to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;donating environment of the Ru/C&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose. The ChCl&#8208;tailored hydrogen&#8208;transfer RCF of lignocellulose was conducted under mild temperature and low&#8208;pressure (&lt;1 bar) conditions, which was applicable to other lignocellulosic biomass sources. We obtained an approximate theoretical yield of propylphenol monomer of 59.2 wt% and selectivity of 97.3% using an optimal content of ChCl (10 wt%) in ethylene glycol at 190 &#176;C for 8 h. When the content of ChCl in ethylene glycol was increased to 110 wt%, the selectivity of propylphenol switched toward propylenephenol (yield of 36.2 wt% and selectivity of 87.6%). The findings in this work provide valuable information for transforming lignin from lignocellulose into value&#8208;add products.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Fluorogenic RNA Nanozipper Enables Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Single Viral mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a genetically encoded RNA nanozipper that allows real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs by in situ self&#8208;assembly in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translation elongation rates of viral mRNAs. This can provide an effective method to monitor the translation activity of individual viral mRNAs in live cells.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of individual viral mRNA translation activities in live cells is essential to obtain critical details of viral mRNA dynamics and to detect its transient responses to environmental stress. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are powerful tools for real&#8208;time imaging of mRNA in live cells, but monitoring the translation activity of individual mRNAs remains a challenge due to their intrinsic photophysical properties. Here, we develop a genetically encoded turn&#8208;on 3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI)&#8208;binding RNA nanozipper with superior brightness and high photostability by in situ self&#8208;assembly of multiple nanozippers along single mRNAs. The nanozipper enables real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translational elongation rate of viral mRNAs.

         <title>Engineering a Self&#8208;Grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;MOF Heterojunction with Selectively Anchored High&#8208;Density Pt Single&#8208;Atomic Cocatalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt with selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts is synthesized by leveraging the chelating functionality of ligands and finely controlled surface reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC. The high activity is confirmed due to the efficient charge separation promoted by the heterojunction and the selective location of Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction.







Abstract
A photocatalyst TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt is developed with a self&#8208;grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction, i.e., TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC, and selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on Ti&#8208;BPDC for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This intimate heterojunction, growing from the surface pyrolytic reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC, works in a direct Z&#8208;scheme, efficiently separating electrons and holes. Pt is selectively anchored on Ti&#8208;BPDC by ligands and is found in the form of single atoms with loading up to 1.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The selective location of Pt is the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction, which further enhances the utilization of the separated electrons. This tailored TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt shows a significantly enhanced activity of 12.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 compared to other TiO2&#8208; or MOF&#8208;based catalysts. The structure&#8208;activity relationship further proves the balance of two simultaneously exposed domains of heterojunctions is critical to fulfilling this kind of catalyst.

         <title>Tuning the Crystal Phase to Form MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel for Highly Efficient Syngas to Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MnGaOx exhibits a strongly crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent activity. The syngas to light olefins activity is significantly enhanced by forming a spinel crystal phase (MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel) when compared to the activity over a solid solution oxide (MnGaOx&#8208;SS) within the catalyst concept of metal oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO). Key: Hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP), Face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC).







Abstract
The oxide&#8211;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept has been demonstrated in an increasing number of studies as an alternative avenue for direct syngas conversion to light olefins. We report that face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel gives 40&#8201;% CO conversion, 81&#8201;% light olefins selectivity, and a 0.17&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 space&#8208;time yield of light olefins in combination with SAPO&#8208;18. In comparison, solid solution MnGaOx (characterized by Mn&#8208;doped hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) Ga2O3) with a similar chemical composition gives a much inferior activity, i.e., the specific surface activity is one order of magnitude lower than the spinel oxide. Photoluminescence (PL), in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the superior activity of MnGaOx&#8208;Spinel can be attributed to its higher reducibility (higher concentration of oxygen vacancies) and the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites, which facilitates the dissociation of the C&#8722;O bond via a more efficient ketene&#8211;acetate pathway to light olefins.

         <title>A Universal Molten Salt Method for Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;rich Cathode towards Single&#8208;crystalline Li&#8208;rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct upcycling of a spent Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2, NCA) to a single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode is achieved for Li&#8208;ion batteries in a binary LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 system. The regenerated NCA exhibits a remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high rate performance and low polarization. This strategy can be extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied Li compositions.







Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing pursuit for high&#8208;value output in recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), traditional recycling methods of cathodes tend to be obsolete because of the complicated procedures. Herein, we first upcycle spent polycrystal LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2 (S&#8208;NCA) to high value&#8208;added single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a simple but feasible LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 eutectic molten salt strategy. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction technique and a series of paratactic experiments record the evolution process of upcycling and prove that excessive Li occupies the transition metal (TM) layers. Beneficial from the single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich nature, the regenerated NCA (R&#8208;NCA) exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high&#8208;rate performance and low polarization. This approach can also be successfully extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied degree of Li loss.

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Benzotriazulene with Three Embedded Azulene Units and Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C3&#8208;symmetrical truxene&#8208;based benzotriazulene derivative with three embedded azulene units was concisely synthesized by means of a cascade [4+3] annulation involving a Suzuki coupling followed by Knoevenagel condensation of a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. The regioselectively trinitrated product exhibits a large Stokes shift of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1 along with unique solvatochromic effects in different solvents.







Abstract
We report here the one&#8208;pot synthesis of benzo[1,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;a&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;a&#8242;&#8242;]triazulene (BTA), wherein three azulene units are embedded through a tandem reaction comprising two steps, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation, between a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. Its nitration leads to a regioselective trinitrated product, namely, BTA&#8208;NO2. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the superstructure of BTA consists of a dimer stacked by two enantiomeric helicene conformers, while that of BTA&#8208;NO2 consists of an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;tetramer stacked from two enantiomeric dimers, that is, four distinct helicene conformers. Both compounds show excellent stability and fluorescence with large Stokes shifts of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In addition, BTA&#8208;NO2 exhibits a unique solvatochromic effect in different solvents and hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced emission transfer in different ratios of THF/H2O solutions.

         <title>Near IR Bandgap Semiconducting 2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Rhombic Lattice and High Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first rhombic 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) single crystal (named Cu2(OHPTP)) is achieved based on a novel octahydroxyphenanthro[9,10:b]triphenylene ligand. Cu2(OHPTP) is an intrinsic p&#8208;type semiconductor with a band gap of 0.5&#8197;eV and charge carrier mobility as high as &#8776;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique class of electronic materials. However, 2D c&#8208;MOFs with band gaps in the Vis&#8208;NIR and high charge carrier mobility are rare. Most of the reported conducting 2D c&#8208;MOFs are metallic (i.e. gapless), which largely limits their use in logic devices. Herein, we design a phenanthrotriphenylene&#8208;based, D2h&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended ligand (OHPTP), and synthesize the first rhombic 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystals (Cu2(OHPTP)). The continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) analysis unveils the orthorhombic crystal structure at the atomic level with a unique slipped AA stacking. The Cu2(OHPTP) is a p&#8208;type semiconductor with an indirect band gap of &#8776;0.50&#8197;eV and exhibits high electrical conductivity of 0.10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and high charge carrier mobility of &#8776;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations underline the predominant role of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in this semiquinone&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Multiblock Copolymerization Accompanying Chirality Transfer in Heterostructures via Living Chain Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or d&#8208;/l&#8208;alanine moieties not only leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;blocks copolymers (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by chain&#8208;growth process, but also transfers chirality at the seed end.







Abstract
We report the unique synthesis of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with controllable chirality using kinetically adjusted seeded supramolecular copolymerization in THF and DMSO (99&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v). Tetraphenylethylene (d&#8208; and l&#8208;TPE) derivatives bearing d&#8208; and l&#8208;alanine side chains formed thermodynamically favored chiral products via a kinetically trapped in monomeric state with a long lag phase. In contrast, achiral TPE&#8208;G containing glycine moieties did not form a supramolecular polymer owing to the energy barrier in its kinetically trapped state. We show that the copolymerization of the metastable states of TPE&#8208;G not only enables the generation of supramolecular BCPs by the seeded living growth method, but also transfers chirality at the seed ends. This research demonstrates the generation of chiral supramolecular tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;BCPs with B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C block patterns accompanying chirality transfer via seeded living polymerization.

         <title>Charge Separation in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enables Heterogeneous Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>

Upon photoactivation, the fast and efficient charge separation along metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) scaffold facilitates the formation of the thiyl radical, a powerful hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. The corresponding MOF competently catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. This research highlights the versatility and practical application potential of MOF&#8208;based heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.







Abstract
Photoinduced metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) enabled heterogeneous thiol catalysis has been achieved for the first time. MOF Zr&#8208;TPDCS&#8208;1, consisting of Zr6&#8208;clusters and TPDCS linkers (TPDCS=3,3&#8242;&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetramercapto[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate), effectively catalyzed the borylation, silylation, phosphorylation, and thiolation of organic molecules. Upon irradiation, the fast electron transfer from TPDCS to Zr6&#8208;cluster is believed to facilitate the formation of the thiyl radical, a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst, which competently abstracts the hydrogen from borane, silane, phosphine, or thiol for generating the corresponding element radical to engender the chemical transformations. The elaborate control experiments evidenced the generation of thiyl radicals in MOF and illustrated a radical reaction pathway. The gram&#8208;scale reaction worked well, and the product was conveniently separated via centrifugation and vacuum with a turnover number (TON) of &#8776;3880, highlighting the practical application potential of heterogeneous thiyl&#8208;radical catalysis.

         <title>Genetic Fusion of Thermoresponsive Polypeptides with UCST&#8208;type Behavior Mediates 1D Assembly of Coiled&#8208;Coil Bundlemers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides were functionalized with thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths and produced via biosynthetic methods in bacterial expression hosts. Interactions between RLPs upon cooling below their upper critical solution temperature (UCST) resulted in nanofibrillar assembly.







Abstract
Thermoresponsive resilin&#8208;like polypeptides (RLPs) of various lengths were genetically fused to two different computationally designed coiled coil&#8208;forming peptides with distinct thermal stability, to develop new strategies to assemble coiled coil peptides via temperature&#8208;triggered phase separation of the RLP units. Their successful production in bacterial expression hosts was verified via gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) turbidimetry, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed the stability of the coiled coils and showed that the thermosensitive phase behavior of the RLPs was preserved in the genetically fused hybrid polypeptides. Cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and coarse&#8208;grained modeling revealed that functionalizing the coiled coils with thermoresponsive RLPs leads to their thermally triggered noncovalent assembly into nanofibrillar assemblies.

         <title>Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy&#8212;Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>

The use of a molecular spring containing an alkyne chain allows the measurement of distances in macrocycles via 13C NMR spectroscopy and reveals the overlooked phenomenon of the inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level.







Abstract
For a molecular system, size and shape are of elementary importance for its function and properties. Therefore, the determination of distances within a molecule is essential. However, the commonly used methods are only suitable for distances smaller than 4&#8197;&#197; or larger than 15&#8197;&#197;. Here, we show that by incorporating a molecular spring, we can measure distances in macrocycles in the range of 10&#8197;&#197; using 13C NMR spectroscopy. The accuracy of the method also allows to determine the temperature dependence of the distances. In one case, we find a contraction of the length by almost 10&#8201;% upon heating. This shrinking due to heating can be considered as inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level and is a previously completely overlooked phenomenon that can be used in the future as a tool to change the length and, thus, the function of a system.

         <title>Layered Monophosphate Tungsten Bronzes [Ba(PO4)2]WmO3m&#8722;3: 2D Metals with Locked Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Instabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the novel MPTB series, thick insulating spacers lock a trigonal symmetry and disrupt tungsten&#8208;oxide blocks. Contrarily to related bronzes, the 2D metallicity is steady down to 1.8&#8197;K, in absence of a charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) instability through Peirls&#8208;like W shifts. However, the 2D Fermi surfaces display the characteristics of hidden nesting, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable 2D metals and CDW order.







Abstract
Phosphate tungsten and molybenum bronzes represent an outstanding class of materials displaying textbook examples of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) physics among other fundamental properties. Here we report on the existence of a novel structural branch with the general formula [Ba(PO4)2][WmO3m&#8722;3] (m=3, 4 and 5) denominated &#8242;layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes&#8242; (L&#8208;MPTB). It results from thick [Ba(PO4)2]4&#8722; spacer layers disrupting the cationic metal&#8208;oxide 2D units and enforcing an overall trigonal structure. Their symmetries are preserved down to 1.8&#8197;K and the compounds show metallic behaviour with no clear anomaly as a function of temperature. However, their electronic structure displays the characteristic Fermi surface of previous bronzes derived from 5d W states with hidden nesting properties. By analogy with previous bronzes, such a Fermi surface should result into CDW order. Evidence of CDW order was only indirectly observed in the low&#8208;temperature specific heat, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable 2D metals and CDW order.

         <title>Ionic Nickel Embedded in Ceria with High Specific CO2 Methanation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were synthesized and tested for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 showing high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations identified ionic Ni species embedded in ceria as the catalytically active centers. Installation of highly dispersed ionic Ni species in the oxide matrix achieved a heterogeneous catalyst with high performance.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methane is gaining increasing interest as one of the most promising ways to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. Ni particles supported on CeO2 represent a highly efficient, stable and inexpensive catalyst for this reaction. Herein, Ni&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles were tested for CO2 methanation showing an extremely high Ni mass&#8208;specific activity and CH4 selectivity. Operando characterization reveals that this performance is tightly associated with ionic &#925;i and Ce3+ surface sites, while formation of metallic Ni does not seem to considerably promote the reaction. Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce&#8208;O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni&#8208;O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni&#8208;Ce pair sites to the activation of H2 and CO2 molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Ni-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles were synthesized and tested for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; showing high Ni mass-specific activity and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. Operando spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations identified ionic Ni species embedded in ceria as the catalytically active centers. Installation of highly dispersed ionic Ni species in the oxide matrix achieved a heterogeneous catalyst with high performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to methane is gaining increasing interest as one of the most promising ways to store intermittent renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. Ni particles supported on CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent a highly efficient, stable and inexpensive catalyst for this reaction. Herein, Ni-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles were tested for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanation showing an extremely high Ni mass-specific activity and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. Operando characterization reveals that this performance is tightly associated with ionic &#925;i and Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; surface sites, while formation of metallic Ni does not seem to considerably promote the reaction. Theoretical calculations confirmed the stability of interstitial ionic Ni sites on ceria surfaces and highlighted the role of Ce-O frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), Ni-O classical Lewis pair (CLP) and Ni-Ce pair sites to the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. To a large extent, the theoretical predictions were validated by in situ spectroscopy under H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gaseous environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Post&#8208;synthetic ligand reduction in luminescent MOFs results in the generation of materials that can emit green, white&#8208;blue and deep blue light.







Abstract
Luminescent materials with tunable emission are becoming increasingly desirable as we move towards needing efficient Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for displays. Key to developing better displays is the advancement of strategies for rationally designing emissive materials that are tunable and efficient. We report a series of emissive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) generated using BUT&#8208;10 (BUT: Beijing University of Technology) that emits green light with &#955;max at 525&#8197;nm. Post&#8208;synthetic reduction of the ketone on the fluorenone ligand in BUT&#8208;10 generates new materials, BUT&#8208;10&#8208;M and BUT&#8208;10&#8208;R. The emission for BUT&#8208;10&#8208;R is hypsochromically&#8208;shifted by 113&#8197;nm. Multivariate BUT&#8208;10&#8208;M structures demonstrate emission with two maxima corresponding to the emission of both fluorenol and fluorenone moieties present in their structures. Our study represents a novel post&#8208;synthetic ligand reduction strategy for producing emissive MOFs with tunable emission ranging from green, white&#8208;blue to deep blue.

         <title>Monitoring the Progression of Early Atherosclerosis Using a Fluorescence Nanoprobe for the Detection and Imaging of Phosphorylation and Glucose Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence assay to analyze the progression of atherosclerosis by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF PCN&#8208;224 with I3&#8722;&#8208;RhB associate. Two&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging was used to observe changes in protein phosphorylation and glucose levels in early atherosclerosis mice models.







Abstract
Monitoring the early stage of atherosclerosis (AS) without plaque formation is of great significance. Herein, we developed a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based fluorescence nanoprobe to analyze the progression of AS by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post&#8208;modification of the MOF with iodine (I3&#8722;)&#8208;rhodamine B (RhB) associate, which realizes the specific recognition of target object through the metal joint ZrIV and I3&#8722;&#8208;RhB, respectively. We investigated different stages of target object changes in the early non&#8208;plaque stage of AS in blood. It was found that the levels of phosphate and glucose in the blood were higher than those of the normal mice. The results of two&#8208;photon images showed that early AS mice had higher levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a suitable fluorescence tool for further revealing the pathogenesis and progression of AS.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Single&#8208;Entity Electrochemistry Enables Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry has been shown to be superior to conventional ensemble electrochemistry for studies of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis. This is due to differences in the relative positions of the Fermi levels of the plasmonic particles and the working electrode between the conventional ensemble and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry setups.







Abstract
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC), based on a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance excitation and an electrochemical bias applied to a plasmonic material, can result in improved electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion compared to conventional electrocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry (SEE) for investigating the intrinsic activity of plasmonic catalysts at the single&#8208;particle level using glucose electrooxidation and oxygen reduction on gold nanoparticles as model reactions. We show that in conventional ensemble measurements, plasmonic effects have minimal impact on photocurrents. We suggest that this is due to the continuous equilibration of the Fermi level (EF) of the deposited gold nanoparticles with the EF of the working electrode, leading to fast neutralization of hot carriers by the measuring circuit. The photocurrents detected in the ensemble measurements are primarily caused by photo&#8208;induced heating of the supporting electrode material. In SEE, the EF of suspended gold nanoparticles is unaffected by the working electrode potential. As a result, plasmonic effects are the dominant source of photocurrents under SEE experimental conditions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization for Hydrogel Synthesis through Barriers and Development of Light&#8208;Regulated Healable Hydrogels under NIR Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This photo&#8208;RAFT process enables the preparation of hydrogels under low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light without deoxygenation. Exploiting enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through barriers. Notably, RAFT units, i.e., thiocarbonylthio groups, embedded in hydrogel networks facilitate the reactivation of polymer chains under NIR wavelengths, enabling the photoinduced healing of hydrogels through non&#8208;transparent barriers.







Abstract
We report an aqueous and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4&#8722;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non&#8208;transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on&#8208;demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&lt;15&#8201;%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT&#8208;mediated networks display more than 80&#8201;% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non&#8208;transparent barriers.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Multi&#8208;Cationic Molecular Chains for Gate Mechanism Controlled Superionic Conduction in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

A COF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (MCMCs) was developed for gate&#8208;mechanism controlled ion transport, achieving a high Li+ conductivity of 4.91&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71 simultaneously. The ultra&#8208;light COF&#8208;MCMC SSE enables a solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) with a high specific energy density of up to 403.4&#8197;Wh&#8722;1&#8201;kg&#8722;1 under a low N/P ratio and high cathode loading.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are high potential in achieving better safety and higher energy density, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) cannot fully satisfy the complicated requirements of SSBs. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multi&#8208;cationic molecular chains (COF&#8208;MCMC) was developed as an efficient SSE. The MCMCs chemically anchored on COF channels were generated by nano&#8208;confined copolymerization of cationic ionic liquid monomers, which can function as Li+ selective gates. The coulombic interaction between MCMCs and anions leads to easier dissociation of Li+ from coordinated states, and thus Li+ transport is accelerated. While the movement of anions is restrained due to the charge interaction, resulting in a high Li+ conductivity of 4.9&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and Li+ transference number of 0.71 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The SSBs with COF&#8208;MCMC demonstrate an excellent specific energy density of 403.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with high cathode loading and limited Li metal source.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydroxyacid Potassium Synergists as an Efficient In Situ Defect Passivator for High Performance Tin&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The researchers developed a novel in situ passivation of SnO2 with optimized SnO2/perovskite interfacial carrier extraction and transport for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.91&#8201;% and a champion fill factor (FF) up to 0.852 were obtained.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO2 electron transport layers have attracted extensive research due to their compelling photovoltaic performance. Herein, we presented an in situ passivation of SnO2 with low&#8208;cost hydroxyacid potassium synergist during deposition to optimize the interface carrier extraction and transport for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stabilities of PSCs. The orbital overlap of the carboxyl oxygen with the Sn atom alongwith the homogenous nano&#8208;particle deposition effectively suppresses the interfacial defects and releases the internal residual strains in the perovskite. Accordingly, a PCE of 24.91&#8201;% with a fill factor (FF) up to 0.852 is obtained for in situ passivated devices, which is one of the highest values for SnO2&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained 80&#8201;% of its initial PCE at 80&#8201;&#176;C over 600&#8197;h, 100&#8201;% PCE at ambient conditions for 1300&#8197;h, and 98&#8201;% after one week maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM1.5G illumination.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Magnesiophilic Coordination Layer Stabilizes Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg0 atoms are exposed to electrolyte solvents, impurities, and anions, leading to side reactions on the anode surface and further passivation. In this work, aniline with magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg0 forms a benign coordination layer to protect the Mg anode from these side reactions.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are seriously plagued by the direct exposure of the Mg anode to the electrolyte components, leading to spontaneous and electrochemical side reactions and interfacial passivation. Herein, a benign coordination layer is constructed at the Mg/electrolyte interface where aniline with a strong magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg is chosen as representative, which has higher adsorption energy than DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane) and trace water. This Mg coordination environment mitigates side reactions, forming a non&#8208;passivating interface consisting of aniline and much fewer by&#8208;products after several cycles. Therefore, the Mg symmetrical cell operates with a low overpotential and uniform Mg0 deposition. This interfacial coordination can also be adopted for Mg anode protection in various electrolyte cases of Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte systems.

         <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Lipid Nanoparticles for Improved Messenger RNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticle containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II Cy&#8208;lipid was developed for potentiating mRNA translation efficiency through a stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation.







Abstract
Endosomal escape remains a central issue limiting the high protein expression of mRNA therapeutics. Here, we present second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing pH activatable NIR&#8208;II dye conjugated lipid (Cy&#8208;lipid) for potentiating mRNA delivery efficiency via a stimulus&#8208;responsive photothermal&#8208;promoted endosomal escape delivery (SPEED) strategy. In acidic endosomal microenvironment, Cy&#8208;lipid is protonated and turns on NIR&#8208;II absorption for light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transduction mediated by 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Then, the heat&#8208;promoted LNPs morphology change triggers rapid escape of NIR&#8208;II LNPs from the endosome, allowing about 3&#8208;fold enhancement of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) encoding mRNA translation capacity compared to the NIR&#8208;II light free group. In addition, the bioluminescence intensity induced by delivered luciferase encoding mRNA in the mouse liver region shows positive correlation with incremental radiation dose, indicating the validity of the SPEED strategy.

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;strength cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte was developed with high Li+ conductivity, Li+ transference number (0.85) and excellent interface stability. The delicate design results in an unprecedented 1200 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C and 25&#176;C is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries, which provides a crucial solution for the industrial production of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting their commercial application.

&lt;p&gt;A low-cost, high-strength cellulose-based quasi-solid polymer electrolyte was developed with high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.85) and excellent interface stability. The delicate design results in an unprecedented 1200 cycles with 97.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 1&#8197;C and 25&#176;C is achieved for the assembled solid-state batteries, which provides a crucial solution for the industrial production of next-generation batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium-metal batteries are considered as the next generation of high-energy-density batteries. However, their solid electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity, poor interface performance, and high production costs, restricting their commercial application. Herein, a low-cost cellulose acetate-based quasi-solid composite polymer electrolyte (C-CLA QPE) was developed with a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (
) of 0.85 and excellent interface stability. The prepared LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP)|C-CLA QPE|Li batteries exhibited excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 97.7&#8201;% after 1200 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. The experimental results and Density Function Theory (DFT) simulation revealed that the partially esterified side groups in the CLA matrix contribute to the migration of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and enhance electrochemical stability. This work provides a promising strategy for fabricating cost-effective, stable polymer electrolytes for solid-state lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A concise asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;quinocarcin has been accomplished with high step economy. A catalytic enantioselective reductive 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of secondary amides using iridium/copper relay catalysis was developed to prepare the key chiral pyrrolidine intermediate with three stereocenters. This protocol features excellent enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
A concise asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;quinocarcin has been accomplished with high step economy from commercially available starting materials. A catalytic enantioselective reductive 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl secondary amides with reactive dipolarophiles using iridium/copper relay catalysis was developed to prepare the key chiral pyrrolidine intermediate with three stereocenters. This protocol features excellent regio&#8208;, exo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The high efficiency was also ensured by a RhIII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/cyclization and a tandem diastereoselective hydrogenation/cyclization to construct the tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;pyrrolidine tetracyclic core unit of quinocarcin.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Zinc Adeninate Framework (ZAF) for Immobilization of Catalytic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic dynamic framework, ZAF, can be readily constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of zinc adeninate macrocycles through H&#8208;bonding interactions. ZAF features high biocompatibility, structural flexibility, pH responsivity, and open base pairing sites, where it can load catalytic ssDNA with 96&#8201;% loading efficiency.







Abstract
Effective immobilization and delivery of genetic materials is at the forefront of biological and medical research directed toward tackling scientific challenges such as gene therapy and cancer treatment. Herein we present a biologically inspired hydrogen&#8208;bonded zinc adeninate framework (ZAF) consisting of zinc adeninate macrocycles that self&#8208;assemble into a 3D framework through adenine&#8208;adenine interactions. ZAF can efficiently immobilize DNAzyme with full protection against enzyme degradation and physiological conditions until it is successfully delivered into the nucleus. As compared to zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), ZAFs are twofold more biocompatible with a significant loading efficiency of 96&#8201;%. Overall, our design paves the way for expanding functional hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based systems as potential platforms for the loading and delivery of biologics.

         <title>Formal Insertion of Alkenes Into C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds Mediated by Fluorine&#8208;Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent a powerful approach to prepare complex fluorinated compounds, yet they are extremely scarce. Here we report a hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated system that allows for activation of activated alkyl fluorides without sequestering the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. This allows for formal insertion of fluorinated styrenes into the C&#8722;F bond affording gem&#8208;difluorinated products.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &#945;&#8208;fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the gem&#8208;difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one&#8208;pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.

         <title>Design of a Bilateral Disulfurating Reagent for Unsymmetrical Polysulfidation</title>

         <dc:description>
A bilateral disulfurating reagent is designed, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8722;S bonds. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride, natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8208;linked with S&#8722;S bonds. Some products of this work showed good antibacterial activities.







Abstract
In this study, we designed a bilateral disulfurating reagent via S&#8722;S motif &#8220;snip and stitch&#8221; processes, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8722;S bonds. The reagent is readily synthesized in high yield using a one&#8208;step reaction from easily available starting materials and is air&#8208;stable. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride were sequentially installed on either side of the S&#8722;S motif. Natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8208;linked with S&#8722;S bonds. Notably, the disulfurating reagent can be used in cyclic disulfide synthesis. At last, some desired products of this work showed good antibacterial activities, which could be employed as novel candidates to control plant pathogenic bacteria.

An innovative technique for the light&#8208;assisted shaping of 1D waveguides to 2D or 3D waveguides in organic crystals is reported. The photoisomerization&#8208;induced crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation results in the mechanical bending of organic crystals on a 2D plane or in 3D free space.







Abstract
We demonstrate an innovative technique to achieve organic 2D and 3D waveguides with peculiar shapes from an acicular, stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystal, (2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;(anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diyl)bis(2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacrylonitrile), Ant&#8208;CF3. The greenish&#8208;yellow fluorescent (FL) Ant&#8208;CF3 molecular crystals exhibit laser power&#8208;dependent permanent mechanical bending in 2D and 3D. Investigation of a single&#8208;crystal using spatially&#8208;resolved Raman/FL/electron microscopy, and theoretical calculations revealed photothermal (Z,E)/(E,E) isomerization&#8208;assisted transition from crystalline to amorphous phase at the laser&#8208;exposed regions. This phenomenon facilitates the dimension engineering of a 1D crystal waveguide into 2D waveguide on a substrate or a 3D waveguide in free space. The bends can be used as interconnection points to couple different optical elements. The presented technique has broader implications in organic photonics and other crystal&#8208;related photonic technologies.

         <title>A Quencher&#8208;Based Blood&#8208;Autofluorescence&#8208;Suppression Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analytes in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we propose a strategy for the suppression of blood autofluorescence to develop an activatable fluorescent probe for reliable quantification of trace analytes in whole blood. As a result of the efficient quenching the blood autofluorescence, this probe achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilutions of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood.







Abstract
Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood. Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency and high brightness. Two 7&#8208;nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H2S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test.

         <title>Sulfenate Anion Catalyzed Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using sulfenate anion organocatalysts, 33 trans&#8208;aziridines were synthesized with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity. This method starts with the readily accessible imines and tolerates broad substrate scope. Further functionalization of the synthesized aziridines yielded 12 novel amino&#8208;containing compounds. This work fills a gap in the synthetic and medicinal chemistry literature by providing facile access to trans&#8208;aziridines.







Abstract
Aziridines are highly valued synthetic targets in organic and medicinal chemistry. The organocatalytic synthesis of such structures with broad substrate scope and good diastereoselectivity, however, is rare. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and diastereoselective synthetic method for the synthesis of trans&#8208;aziridines from imines and benzylic or alkyl halides utilizing sulfenate anions (PhSO&#8211;) as the catalyst. Substrates bearing heterocyclic aromatic groups, alkyl, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aryl groups were shown to be compatible with this method (33&#8197;examples), giving good yields and high diastereoselectivities (trans : cis &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Further functionalization of aziridines containing cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl groups was achieved through ring&#8208;opening reactions, with a cyclobutyl&#8208;substituted norephedrine derivative obtained through a four&#8208;step synthesis. We offer a mechanistic proposal involving reversible addition of the deprotonated benzyl sulfoxide to the imine to explain the high trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Absorbing B,N&#8208;Heteroarene as Photosensitizer for High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based NIR photosensitizer with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters has been designed and synthesized, which enables heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion with a high upconversion quantum yield (2.9&#8201;%, upper limit 50&#8201;%) and the record&#8208;large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers is highly desirable for a variety of emerging applications. However, the development of NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC with a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift is extremely challenging because of the energy loss during the intersystem crossing (ISC). Here, we develop the first NIR&#8208;absorbing B,N&#8208;heteroarene&#8208;based sensitizer (BNS) with multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) characters to achieve efficient NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue TTA&#8208;UC. The small energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states (0.14&#8197;eV) of BNS suppresses the ISC energy loss, and its long&#8208;delayed fluorescence lifetime (115&#8197;&#956;s) contributes to efficient triplet energy transfer. As a result, the largest anti&#8208;Stokes shift (1.03&#8197;eV) among all heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;activatable TTA&#8208;UC systems is obtained with a high TTA&#8208;UC quantum yield of 2.9&#8201;% (upper limit 50&#8201;%).

         <title>Coordinating the Edge Defects of Bismuth with Sulfur for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi nanosheets with the edge defect sites coordinated with S via electrochemical reconstruction of Bi19Br3S27 nanowires (BBS), and the edge&#8208;sulfur modulated Bi catalyst demonstrates enhanced formate production and suppressed hydrogen evolution. In an alkaline electrolyte, the edge&#8208;sulfur modulated Bi nanosheets exhibit high current density (&#8776;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and FE of HCOO&#8722; (&gt;90&#8201;%) and very low FE of H2 (&lt;5&#8201;%) over a wide potential range.







Abstract
Bismuth&#8208;based materials have been recognized as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, they show poor selectivity due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we have developed an edge defect modulation strategy for Bi by coordinating the edge defects of bismuth (Bi) with sulfur, to promote ECO2RR selectivity and inhibit the competing HER. The prepared catalysts demonstrate excellent product selectivity, with a high HCOO&#8722; Faraday efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;% and an HCOO&#8722; partial current of &#8776;250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under alkaline electrolytes. Density function theory calculations reveal that sulfur tends to bind to the Bi edge defects, reducing the coordination&#8208;unsaturated Bi sites (*H adsorption sites), and regulating the charge states of neighboring Bi sites to improve *OCHO adsorption.

&lt;p&gt;The Bi nanosheets with the edge defect sites coordinated with S via electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires (BBS), and the edge-sulfur modulated Bi catalyst demonstrates enhanced formate production and suppressed hydrogen evolution. In an alkaline electrolyte, the edge-sulfur modulated Bi nanosheets exhibit high current density (&#8776;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and FE of HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;gt;90&#8201;%) and very low FE of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;lt;5&#8201;%) over a wide potential range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuth-based materials have been recognized as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). However, they show poor selectivity due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we have developed an edge defect modulation strategy for Bi by coordinating the edge defects of bismuth (Bi) with sulfur, to promote ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR selectivity and inhibit the competing HER. The prepared catalysts demonstrate excellent product selectivity, with a high HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; Faraday efficiency of &#8776;95&#8201;% and an HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; partial current of &#8776;250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under alkaline electrolytes. Density function theory calculations reveal that sulfur tends to bind to the Bi edge defects, reducing the coordination-unsaturated Bi sites (*H adsorption sites), and regulating the charge states of neighboring Bi sites to improve *OCHO adsorption. This work deepens our understanding of ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR mechanism on bismuth-based catalysts, guiding for the design of advanced ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1&#8208;Azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By judicious development of acylimidazolinone as activating group and the use of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA) catalyst, the cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes with 2&#8208;naphthols was realized with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity and excellent enantioselectivity. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and stereoretentive conversions of products to other binaphthyl compounds were found viable.







Abstract
Atroposelective cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most appealing routes to construct axially chiral binaphthyl molecules due to the modular and succinct nature. Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings offer reliable synthetic means, alternative reaction modes that could be applied to broader substrate range without their pre&#8208;functionalization is highly desirable. Herein we show that the application of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst as organocatalyst could accomplish cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;naphthols with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity as well as excellent enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility. The identification of acylimidazolinone auxiliary for azo activating group, effective remote catalyst control and arene resonance effect synergistically play key roles in the development of this method. The utility is further demonstrated by transformations of the products into other binaphthyl compounds with perfectly retained axial chirality.

         <title>Elaborating E/Z&#8208;Geometry of Alkenes via Cage&#8208;Confined Arylation Catalysis of Terminal Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
A visible light photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic cage was employed as an artificial enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor for the selective arylation of terminal olefins, giving rise to controllable syntheses of geometrically defined E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes with benzonitrile as the turn on/off key.







Abstract
A visible light photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic cage is applied as an artificial supramolecular reactor to control the reaction of aryl radicals with terminal olefins under green light/solvent conditions, which facilitates selective transformation in the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment to give a series of geometrically defined E/Z&#8208;alkenes. The hydrophobic cage displays good host&#8211;guest inclusion with aromatic substrates, promoting Meerwein arylation and protecting E&#8208;isomeric products during reaction; while a small amount of benzonitrile can turn on efficient E&#8594;Z isomerization. Besides &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, the hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding interactions also act as control forces for the arylation of aliphatic terminal olefins known as poor acceptors in classic Meerwein arylation. The application of this switchable cage&#8208;confined arylation catalysis has been demonstrated by the syntheses of Tapinarof and a marine natural product from the same substrate via controllable E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;specific Poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) Copolymers via Chemoselective Terpolymerization Controlled by the Stoichiometric Ratio of Phosphazene/Triethylborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers with different compositions, sequential structures, topologies, and PC contents were readily synthesized via chemoselective terpolymerization of CO2, epoxide and anhydride by simply adjusting the molar ratio of C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB.







Abstract
Chemoselective terpolymerization can produce polymer materials with diverse compositions and sequential structures, and thus have attracted considerable attention in the field of polymer synthesis. However, the intrinsic complexity of three&#8208;component system also brings great chanllenge, in regard to the reactivity and selectivity of different monomers. Herein, we report the terpolymerization of CO2/epoxide/anhydride by a binary organocatalytic C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB (triethylborane) system. Both the activity and chemoselectivity were highly dependent upon the molar ratio of C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3 to TEB, and sequence&#8208;controlled poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers were readily synthesized through one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step methodology by tuning the stoichiometric ratio of phosphazene/TEB. In particular, C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 exhibited an unprecedentedly high chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CO2/CHO. Thus, well&#8208;defined triblock polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polyester&#8208;b&#8208;polycarbonate copolymers can be produced from the mixture of CO2, CHO and PA using a bifunctional initiator. With C3N3&#8208;Py&#8208;P3/TEB=1/1, tapered copolymers were obtained, while random copolymers with high content of polycarbonate (PC) were synthesized with further increasing the amount of TEB. The mechanism of the unexpected chemoselectivity was further investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane</title>

A photo&#8208;driven Fe3+ complex is efficient for the photochemical coupling of CH4 to C2H6 with high selectivity. Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+, and the hydroxyl was oxidized to form a &#8901;OH radical for CH4 activation. Fe2+ can be reused for electrolytic H2 production and converted back to Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable system.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven CH4 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products and H2 is attractive but challenging, and the development of efficient catalytic systems is critical. Herein, we construct a solar&#8208;energy&#8208;driven redox cycle for combining CH4 conversion and H2 production using iron ions. A photo&#8208;driven iron&#8208;induced reaction system was developed, which is efficient at selective coupling of CH4 as well as conversion of benzene and cyclohexane under mild conditions. For CH4 conversion, 94&#8201;% C2 selectivity and a C2H6 formation rate of 8.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 is achieved. Mechanistic studies reveal that CH4 coupling is induced by hydroxyl radical, which is generated by photo&#8208;driven intermolecular charge migration of an Fe3+ complex. The delicate coordination structure of the [Fe(H2O)5OH]2+ complex ensures selective C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;C coupling of CH4. The produced Fe2+ can be used to reduce the potential for electrolytic H2 production, and then turns back into Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable recyclable system.

&lt;p&gt;Photo-driven CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to multi-carbon products and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is attractive but challenging, and the development of efficient catalytic systems is critical. Herein, we construct a solar-energy-driven redox cycle for combining CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production using iron ions. A photo-driven iron-induced reaction system was developed, which is efficient at selective coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as well as conversion of benzene and cyclohexane under mild conditions. For CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, 94&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity and a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; formation rate of 8.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. Mechanistic studies reveal that CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coupling is induced by hydroxyl radical, which is generated by photo-driven intermolecular charge migration of an Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex. The delicate coordination structure of the [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex ensures selective C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;C coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The produced Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be used to reduce the potential for electrolytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, and then turns back into Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming an energy-saving and sustainable recyclable system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Enhances the Photodynamic Properties of a NIR&#8208;II Emitting Photosensitizer with Extended Conjugation</title>

NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers show promising applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the PDT efficiency of such photosensitizers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths still needs improvement. In this work, we demonstrate that the chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; organizing strategy can facilitate energy/charge transfer, subsequently improving the PDT performance of NIR&#8208;II emitting photosensitizers.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted great research interest due to their promising clinical applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to realize highly efficient PDT on NIR&#8208;II PSs. In this work, we develop a chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8211;&#960; organizing strategy to improve the PDT of a PS with conjugation&#8208;extended A&#8208;D&#8208;A architecture. The significant dipole moment of the carbon&#8208;chlorine bond and the strong intermolecular interactions of chlorine atoms bring on compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the chlorine&#8208;substituted PS, which facilitates energy/charge transfer and promotes the photochemical reactions of PDT. Consequently, the resultant NIR&#8208;II emitting PS exhibits a leading PDT performance with a yield of reactive oxygen species higher than that of previously reported long&#8208;wavelength PSs. These findings will enlighten the future design of NIR&#8208;II emitting PSs with enhanced PDT efficiency.

         <title>1D Choline&#8208;PbI3&#8208;Based Heterostructure Boosts Efficiency and Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ChPbI3 was obtained by ChI treatment of the CsPbI3 surface to construct a 1D/3D heterostructure, which significantly improves the defect&#8208;assisted recombination and stability of CsPbI3. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, the assembled carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion/certified efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%/17.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI3 to form a novel crystal phase of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ChPbI3, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI3, passivating the defects of CsPbI3 more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2&#8197;ns to 49.4&#8197;ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI3 and the repair of undesired &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI3 film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI3 carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05&#8201;% and a new certified record of 17.8&#8201;% in hole transport material (HTM)&#8208;free inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Functional DNA Superstructures Exhibit Positive Homotropic Allostery in Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional DNA superstructures made of concatemeric aptamers display strongly cooperative binding to both small molecules and proteins, without loss of binding affinities of their parent aptamers, thus allowing for the design of a highly responsive sensing system responding over a narrow target range.







Abstract
Inspired by intrinsically disordered proteins in nature, DNA aptamers can be engineered to display strongly homotropic allosteric (or cooperative) ligand binding, representing a unique feature that could be of great utility in applications such as biosensing, imaging and drug delivery. The use of an intrinsic disorder mechanism, however, comes with an inherent drawback of significantly reduced overall binding affinity. We hypothesize that it could be addressed via the design of multivalent supramolecular aptamers. We built functional DNA superstructures (denoted as 3D DNA), made of long&#8208;chain DNA containing tandem repeating DNA aptamers (or concatemeric aptamers). The 3D DNA systems exhibit highly cooperative binding to both small molecules and proteins, without loss of binding affinities of their parent aptamers. We further produced a highly responsive sensor for fluorescence imaging of glutamate stimulation&#8208;evoked adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release in neurons, as well as force stimulus&#8208;triggered ATP release in astrocytes.

         <title>Phosphorothioated DNA Engineered Liposomes as a General Platform for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Cell&#8208;Specific Intracellular Delivery and Genome Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;specific and stimuli&#8208;responsive cytosolic protein delivery was achieved through a macromolecular fusion machine composed of protein&#8208;loading liposomes and fusogenic phosphorothioated DNA coatings, which mimic the recognition and stimuli&#8208;responsive conformational changes of viral hemagglutinin. This fusion machine provides a versatile platform for various cell type&#8208;dependent biomacromolecules delivery both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery is highly desirable for protein drug&#8208;based cell therapy. Established technologies suffer from poor cell&#8208;specific cytosolic protein delivery, which hampers the targeting therapy of specific cell populations. A fusogenic liposome system enables cytosolic delivery, but its ability of cell&#8208;specific and controllable delivery is quite limited. Inspired by the kinetics of viral fusion, we designed a phosphorothioated DNA coatings&#8208;modified fusogenic liposome to mimic the function of viral hemagglutinin. The macromolecular fusion machine docks cargo&#8208;loaded liposomes at the membrane of target cells, triggers membrane fusion upon pH or UV light stimuli, and facilitates cytosolic protein delivery. Our results showed efficient cell&#8208;targeted delivery of proteins of various sizes and charges, indicating the phosphorothioated DNA plug&#8208;in unit on liposomes could be a general strategy for spatial&#8208;temporally controllable protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of NO2 on TiO2: Evidence of a New Source of N2O5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical mechanism for the generation of gaseous N2O5 in atmosphere via the photocatalytic oxidation of NO2 on TiO2 is shown, and this new source of N2O5 may have important implications to the near&#8208;ground air quality in urban areas and day time due to the presence of both abundant TiO2&#8208;containing building materials and high NOx concentrations.







Abstract
N2O5 is an important intermediate in the atmospheric nitrogen cycle. Using a flow tube reactor, N2O5 was found to be released from the TiO2 surface during the photocatalytic oxidation of NO2, revealing a previously unreported source of N2O5. The rate of N2O5 release from TiO2 was dependent on the initial NO2 concentration, relative humidity, O2/N2 ratio, and irradiation intensity. Experimental evidence and quantum chemical calculations showed that NO2 can react with the surface hydroxyl groups and the generated electron holes on the TiO2, followed by combining with another NO2 molecule to form N2O5. The latter was physisorbed on TiO2 and had a low adsorption energy of &#8722;0.13&#8197;eV. Box model simulations indicated that the new source of N2O5 released from TiO2 can increase the daytime N2O5 concentration by up to 20&#8201;% in urban areas if abundant TiO2&#8208;containing materials and high NOx concentrations were present. This joint experimental/theoretical study not only demonstrates a new chemical mechanism for N2O5 formation but also has important implications for air quality in urban areas.

         <title>Multimodal Self&#8208;sustainable Autonomous Locomotions of Light&#8208;driven Seifert Ribbon Actuators based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven liquid crystal elastomer ribbon actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotion is constructed based on the topology of Seifert surface. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and realize the adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions.







Abstract
Multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotions integrated into one individual system, are high&#8208;level intelligent behavioral characteristics of living organisms and are the scientific hotspot of bionic soft actuators. Here, we report a light&#8208;fueled soft actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable movements based on a Seifert ribbon bounded by a Hopf link. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and the actuation component becomes either a discontinuous strip&#8208;like structure or a continuous toroidal structure, which can realize adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions. The two motion modes are applied to the self&#8208;oscillatory piezoelectric generation and self&#8208;rotational work multiplication of cargo transport, respectively. The unique smartness of Seifert surface topology advances the level of actuation intelligence with broad implications for the adaptability, multifunctionality, and autonomy of soft robots.

         <title>Simultaneous Ring Contraction and Expansion Reaction: Electrosynthesis of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Fulleroids and Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemically triggered simultaneous ring contraction and expansion reaction of fullerotetrahydropyridazines with electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen affords pyrazoline&#8208;fused fulleroids with unprecedented 1,1,2,6&#8208; or 1,1,4,6&#8208;addition patterns.







Abstract
Simultaneous electrochemical ring contraction and expansion reactions remain unexplored to date. Herein, the reductive electrosynthesis of heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids from fullerotetrahydropyridazines and electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen has been achieved with concurrent ring contraction and ring expansion. When trifluoroacetic acid and alkyl bromides are employed as electrophiles, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,2,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively formed. In contrast, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,4,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively produced as two separable stereoisomers if phthaloyl chloride is used as the electrophile. The reaction proceeds through multiple steps of electroreduction, heterocycle ring&#8208;opening, oxygen oxidation, heterocycle contraction, fullerene cage expansion, and nucleophilic addition. The structures of these fulleroids have been determined by spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The observed high regioselectivities have been rationalized by theoretical calculations. Representative fulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells as the third component and exhibit good performance.

         <title>Quantifying the Contribution of Hot Electrons in Photothermal Catalysis: A Case Study of Ammonia Synthesis over Carbon&#8208;supported Ru Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The actual reaction temperature of photothermal catalytic ammonia synthesis was determined according to Le Chatelier&#8242;s principle, enabling the contributions of hot&#8208;electron and local heating effects to be quantified separately. Further, we systematically investigated the hot&#8208;electron enhancement mechanism by disentangling the hot&#8208;electron effects from the local heating.







Abstract
Photothermal catalysis is one of the most promising green catalytic technologies, while distinguishing the effects of hot electrons and local heating remains challenging. Herein, we reported that the actual reaction temperature of photothermal ammonia synthesis over carbon&#8208;supported Ru catalyst can be measured based on Le Chatelier&#8242;s principle, enabling the hot&#8208;electron contribution to be quantified. By excluding local heating effects, we established that the activation energy via photothermal catalysis was much lower than that of thermocatalysis (54.9 vs. 126.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), stemming from hot&#8208;electron injection lowering the energy barriers for both N2 dissociation and intermediates hydrogenation. Furthermore, hot&#8208;electron injection acted to suppress carbon support methanation, giving the catalyst outstanding operational stability over 1000&#8197;h. This work provides new insights into the hot&#8208;electron effects in ammonia synthesis, guiding the design of high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Enantioconvergence and Kinetic Resolution in the Coupling of Tertiary Cyclobutenols with Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable transformation including an enantioconvergent or a kinetic resolution step was used in the reaction of tertiary cyclobutenols with arylboroxines under a Ni/modified SPINOL catalytic system. This reaction allows the direct use of free hydroxyl groups as leaving groups while the strained ring remains untouched and provides enantioenriched cyclobutenes having a tertiary hydroxyl or an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
We report that a nickel catalyst system with a modified 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol&#8208;phosphoramidite (SPINOL) as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling of tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an s factor of up to &gt;200. The reaction uses free hydroxyl groups as the leaving group without additional activation while the strained ring remains untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.

&lt;p&gt;We report that a nickel catalyst system with a modified 1,1&#8242;-spirobiindane-7,7&#8242;-diol-phosphoramidite (SPINOL) as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling of tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84&#8201;% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; factor of up to &amp;gt;200. The reaction uses free hydroxyl groups as the leaving group without additional activation while the strained ring remains untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversing Free&#8208;Electron Transfer of MoS2+x Cocatalyst for Optimizing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Enables High Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To create a beneficial transfer direction for cultivating moderate hydrogen&#8208;atom adsorption/desorption on a co&#8208;catalyst, an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed that optimizes the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. The embedded Au can reverse the free&#8208;electron transfer to MoS2+x to form electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722;, which causes an increased antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy, thus weakening S&#8722;Hads bonds for photocatalytic H2 evolution.







Abstract
The interaction between a co&#8208;catalyst and photocatalyst usually induces spontaneous free&#8208;electron transfer between them, but the effect and regulation of the transfer direction on the hydrogen&#8208;adsorption energy of the active sites have not received attention. Herein, to steer the free&#8208;electron transfer in a favorable direction for weakening S&#8722;Hads bonds of sulfur&#8208;rich MoS2+x, an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed for the first time. The core&#8211;shell Au@MoS2+x cocatalyst was constructed on TiO2 to optimize the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. Research results reveal that the embedded Au can reverse the electron transfer to MoS2+x to generate electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722; active sites, thus increasing the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of S&#8722;Hads in the Au@MoS2+x cocatalyst. Consequently, the increase in the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy effectively destabilizes the H&#8197;1s&#8208;p antibonding orbital and weakens the S&#8722;Hads bond, realizing the expedited desorption of Hads to rapidly generate a lot of visible H2 bubbles. This work delves deep into the latent effect of the photocatalyst carrier on cocatalytic activity.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Kinetic Boron Conjugate Addition of &#947;&#8208;Substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric kinetic boron conjugate addition of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams followed by oxidation is reported with good results. This strategy provides an efficient access to valuable enantioenriched &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituents, which showed inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cells A2780. A new Lewis acid Cu&#8208;catalyzed mechanism was put forward.







Abstract
Chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing simple &#947;&#8208; substituents are found in biologically active molecules and natural products, however, their synthesis still remains difficult. Herein, we report an efficient kinetic resolution (KR) of &#947;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactams via a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric boron conjugate addition, which also leads to the efficient synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbon centers. The KR proceeded smoothly with a wide range of &#947;&#8208;alkyl or aryl substituted substrates including those bearing aromatic heterocycles and different N&#8208;protected substrates in up to 347 of s value. Their highly versatile transformations, synthetic utility in biologically active molecules, and inhibitory activities against cisplatin&#8208;sensitive ovarian cancer cell A2780 have also been demonstrated. Differing from the well&#8208;known mechanism involving Cu&#8722;B species in Cu&#8208;catalyzed boron conjugate additions, our mechanistic studies using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments indicate that a Lewis acid CuI&#8208;catalyzed mechanism is the likely pathway in the catalytic reaction.

         <title>Lithium Ferrocyanide Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy and Low&#8208;cost Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>

The designed redox&#8208;active material for aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFB), lithium ferrocyanide (Li4[Fe(CN)6]), exhibits a solubility of 2.32&#8197;M, much higher than Na4[Fe(CN)6] (0.56&#8197;M) and K4[Fe(CN)6] (0.76&#8197;M). It endows the constructed [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;&#8208;based ARFB system with high capacity up to 61.64&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (pH&#8208;neutral) and 56.28&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (alkaline) at a concentration of 2.30&#8197;M and 2.10&#8197;M cathode reactant, which is the highest value in all reported aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are a promising technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, their commercial success relies on redox&#8208;active materials (RAM) with high electron storage capacity and cost competitiveness. Herein, a redox&#8208;active material lithium ferrocyanide (Li4[Fe(CN)6]) is designed. Li+ ions not only greatly boost the solubility of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to 2.32&#8197;M at room temperature due to weak intermolecular interactions, but also improves the electrochemical performance of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;. By coupling with Zn, ZIRFBs were built, and the capacity of the batteries was as high as 61.64&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (pH&#8208;neutral) and 56.28&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 (alkaline) at a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; concentration of 2.30&#8197;M and 2.10&#8197;M. These represent unprecedentedly high [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; concentrations and battery energy densities reported to date. Moreover, benefiting from the low cost of Li4[Fe(CN)6], the overall chemical cost of alkaline ZIRFB is as low as $11 per kWh, which is one&#8208;twentieth that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art VFB ($211.54&#8197;per&#8201;kWh). This work breaks through the limitations of traditional electrolyte composition optimization and will strongly promote the development of economical [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;based RFBs in the future.

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new layered zeolite (ECNU&#8208;28) with interlayer swollen structure is prepared hydrothermally using decamethonium bromide as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Its phase exfoliation is realized under mild conditions, giving high&#8208;quality suspensions containing flat and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. The resulting 2D zeolite membrane prepared by vacuum filtration gives high&#8208;performance sieving of H2 from CO2 or CH4.







Abstract
Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;4.8&#8197;&#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.

         <title>Tuning Pore Polarization to Boost Ethane/Ethylene Separation Performance in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pore polarity tuning strategy has been realized through the solid&#8208;state transformation of graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, which significantly improves the performance of one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixture.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) show great potential in energy&#8208;saving C2H6/C2H4 separation, but there are few examples of one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 because it is still difficult to achieve the reverse&#8208;order adsorption of C2H6 and C2H4. In this work, we boost the C2H6/C2H4 separation performance in two graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like HOFs by tuning pore polarization. Upon heating, an in situ solid phase transformation can be observed from HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (DMA=dimethylamine cation) to HOF&#8208;NBDA, accompanied with transformation of the electronegative skeleton into neutral one. As a result, the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA has become nonpolar, which is beneficial to selectively adsorbing C2H6. The difference in the capacities for C2H6 and C2H4 is 23.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for HOF&#8208;NBDA, and the C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio is 136&#8201;%, which are much higher than those for HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.0&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 108&#8201;% respectively). Practical breakthrough experiments demonstrate HOF&#8208;NBDA could produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) mixture with a high productivity of 29.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, which is about five times as high as HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.4&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1). In addition, in situ breakthrough experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA is beneficial to preferentially capture C2H6 and thus boosts selective separation of C2H6/C2H4.

         <title>Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Force Driven Sublimation&#8208;Removable Chiral Coassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalene&#8208;F8 was introduced to modulate the perylene&#8208;conjugated peptoid self&#8208;assemblies, leading to the emergence of helical nanostructures. Sublimation was initiated in a vacuum oven which efficiently removed Naphthalene&#8208;F8 from coassemblies, which realized a physical protocol to facilitate the versatile fabrication of soft chiral assemblies and chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Multiple constituent coassembly is an emerging strategy to manipulate supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, the second or third constituent could not be removed from pristine self&#8208;assembly. Here we developed a constitute&#8208;removable chiral coassembly using sublimation that could realize coassembly with tunable supramolecular chirality, luminescence and CPL properties. Octafluoronapthalene (OFN) with small sublimation enthalpy formed coassemblies with perylene&#8208;conjugated peptoids via arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction that induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and hypsochromic luminescence from yellow to green. Coassembly with OFN accelerated one&#8208;dimensional growth and induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and CPL. Despite the stability at ambient conditions, vacuum&#8208;treatment triggered fast sublimation of OFN, which behaved as a sacrificial template. Physical removal of OFN retained the helical nanoarchitectures as well as the basic features of Cotton effects and CPL activities. X&#8208;ray diffraction suggested the back&#8208;fill consolidation occurred on the molecular voids by OFN removal that slightly varied the templated molecular arrangements. Sublimation of perfluorinated building units is green and efficient and non&#8208;destructive, which is potentially applicable in constructing template&#8208;directed chiroptical materials and devices.

         <title>Bifunctional Interphase with Target&#8208;Distributed Desolvation Sites and Directionally Depositional Ion Flux for Sustainable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;based interphase with target&#8208;distributed desolvation sites and ionic channels is strategically designed for restricting side reactions and zinc dendrites. This layer accurately regulates active water and induces Zn2+ oriented deposition, achieving highly reversible zinc anodes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) feature high safety and low cost, but intricate anodic side reactions and dendrite growth severely restrict their commercialization. Herein, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) grafted metal organic framework (MOF&#8208;E) is proposed as a dually&#8208;functional anodic interphase for sustainable Zn anode. Specifically, the target&#8208;distributed EDTA serves as an ion&#8208;trapped tentacle to accelerate the desolvation and ionic transport by powerful chemical coordination, while the MOFs offer suitable ionic channels to induce oriented deposition. As a result, MOF&#8208;E interphase fundamentally suppresses side reactions and guides horizontally arranged Zn deposition with (002) preferred orientations. The Zn|MOF&#8208;E@Cu cell exhibits a markedly improved Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 2500 cycles, and the MOF&#8208;E@Zn|KVOH (KV12O30&#8208;y&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O) cell yields a steady circulation of 5000 cycles@90.47&#8201;% at 8&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

In 2019, IUPAC started the &#8220;Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry&#8221; initiative. This article reviews the impact of the initiative and how it contributes to different areas, including sustainability, technology transfer, and education.







Abstract
In the past 15&#8197;years, we've experienced an unprecedented series of crises, including financial (2008), health (2020), and most recently the supply chain disruptions and the energy emergency in Europe, caused by the war in Ukraine (2022). On top of that, climate change still poses a serious threat to our lives and our planet. These interconnected challenges create tremendous societal problems and compromise the viability of the chemical industry in an environment of price volatility and high inflation. Thus, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has launched a series of actions to tackle this and raise awareness of the role of chemistry in solving our major threats. Since 2019, IUPAC has identified the &#8220;Top Ten Emerging Technologies in Chemistry&#8221; to connect chemical researchers with industry, bridging the gap between science and innovation, maintaining the current competitiveness of the chemical industry, as well as tackling our most pressing global challenges.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy&#8212;Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 25/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The determination of nanometer&#8208;scale distances in solution is an enormous challenge. In their Research Article (e202301465) Gebhard Haberhauer and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that distances in macrocycles can be measured using a molecular spring and 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The sensitivity of the method even allows the determination of thermoelasticity at the molecular level: One studied system expands at low temperatures and shrinks at high temperatures.

Hydrogel preparation under NIR light&#160;via a photoinduced RAFT polymerization catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine is reported by Cyrille Boyer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302451). Exploiting enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through barriers. Thiocarbonylthio groups embedded in hydrogel networks facilitate the reactivation of polymer chains under NIR wavelengths, enabling the photoinduced healing of hydrogels through non&#8208;transparent barriers.

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion battery prepared by low&#8208;cost cellulose acetate exhibits extraordinary electrochemical stability, as reported by Lei Tian, Caizhen Zhu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302767). The cellulose part in cellulose acetate is like a mountain forest. The esterified side groups are like the Great Wall built between the mountain forest, providing high&#8208;speed and stable transport channels for lithium ions.

The copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of tetraphenylethylene containing glycine (TPE&#8208;G) and/or D&#8208;/L&#8208;alanine moieties leads to the formation of supramolecular multi&#8208;block copolymers, such as B&#8208;A&#8208;B, A&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;A, and C&#8208;B&#8208;A&#8208;B&#8208;C patterns (BCPs; tri&#8208; and penta&#8208;blocks) by a chain&#8208;growth process. The chirality of the supramolecular BCPs was not only successfully controlled by the chiral seed, but it also transferred to an achiral component during the chain&#8208;growth polymerization, as reported Sung&#8197;Ho Jung, Jong&#8197;Hwa Jung et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202300913).

         <title>Imaging Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Membrane Interactions: Ion&#8208;Channel Pores and Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Permeability in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric, protofibril, annular and fibril assemblies is intimately linked with neuronal toxicity and Alzheimer's disease. A&#946; can have a range of impacts on the lipid membrane including a carpeting effect and ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Imaging these interactions with the lipid bilayer is providing a clearer picture of A&#946;&#8208;induced membrane permeability, which leads to loss of cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
The accumulation of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which A&#946; triggers a cascade of events that leads to dementia is a topic of intense investigation. A&#946; self&#8208;associates into a series of complex assemblies with different structural and biophysical properties. It is the interaction of these oligomeric, protofibril and fibrillar assemblies with lipid membranes, or with membrane receptors, that results in membrane permeability and loss of cellular homeostasis, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. A&#946; can have an array of impacts on lipid membranes, reports have included: a carpeting effect; a detergent effect; and A&#946; ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Recent advances imaging these interactions are providing a clearer picture of A&#946; induced membrane disruption. Understanding the relationship between different A&#946; structures and membrane permeability will inform therapeutics targeting A&#946; cytotoxicity.

         <title>Visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV Photon Upconversion: Recent Progress in New Materials and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent progress in photon upconversion from visible to ultraviolet light based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. The development of new chromophores, which have achieved high efficiency and low threshold excitation intensity, the material design for film formation, and their application in various photochemical processes are summarized, and the future challenges as an ultraviolet light source are discussed.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV, &#955;&lt;400&#8197;nm) light is essential for various photochemical reactions, but its intensity in the solar spectrum is very low, and light sources that artificially generate high&#8208;energy UV light are inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. A solution to this problem is photon upconversion (UC) from visible (vis, &#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm) light to UV light. Among several mechanisms, UC based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) in particular has made remarkable progress in recent years. The development of new chromophores has enabled highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;intensity visible light into UV light. In this review, we summarize the recent development of visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV TTA&#8208;UC, from the development of chromophores and their production into films to their application in various photochemical processes such as catalysis, bond activation and polymerization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in future material development and applications will be discussed.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Complexes of Lanthanides and d&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review aims to catalogue all accounts of lanthanide and d&#8208;metal chiral complexes which show circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR). Recent improvements in the rational design of suitable complexes which show strong emission properties and high chiroptical activity will be discussed, as well as the setups capable of measuring NIR&#8208;CPL.







Abstract
In recent years, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has witnessed a renaissance, due to the increased popularity of CPL as a spectroscopic technique and greater accessibility to instrumentation. New efficient CPL emitters have been designed and many applications, ranging from electronic devices to microscopy have been proposed. Most examples of CPL are within the visible range, while few cases of near infrared (NIR) CPL active complexes are available. NIR&#8208;CPL compounds may have applications in the telecommunication industry, electronic devices and bioassays. In the following, we shall give an overview of the recent developments allowing for the measurements of NIR&#8208;CPL, and describe the chiroptical properties of metal complexes which achieve this feat.

         <dc:description>
COFs as emerging crystalline porous materials have shown great potential for water harvesting, as their high porosity and exposed polar sites promote the sorption of water and penetrative pore channels accelerate water diffusions. Various strategies of designing high&#8208;performance COF sorbents in thermodynamics and dynamics are presented by accentuating the critical relationships between structures and water sorption properties.

Water scarcity is becoming an increasingly pressing issue due to global population growth and industrialization. One effective approach to addressing this issue is sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of porous crystalline material that have emerged as promising sorbents for water harvesting due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, and customizable pore chemistry. In this mini&#8208;review, we provide an overview of the different types of COFs, their structural characteristics, and the diverse linkage chemistries used to construct them. Then, we summarize recent advances in using COF&#8208;based sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, including strategies for controlling sorption properties and optimizing performance in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges associated with improving the efficiency of COF&#8208;based SAWH systems.

&lt;p&gt;COFs as emerging crystalline porous materials have shown great potential for water harvesting, as their high porosity and exposed polar sites promote the sorption of water and penetrative pore channels accelerate water diffusions. Various strategies of designing high-performance COF sorbents in thermodynamics and dynamics are presented by accentuating the critical relationships between structures and water sorption properties.

         <title>Chasing the Elusive &#8220;In&#8208;Between&#8221; State of the Copper&#8208;Amyloid &#946; Complex by X&#8208;ray Absorption through Partial Thermal Relaxation after Photoreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction and thermal relaxation unravels the structure of an intermediate of the CuII/CuI A&#946;1&#8211;16 redox cycling. The X&#8208;ray beam promotes CuII reduction to CuI at 10&#8197;K, then the sample undergoes partial structural relaxation at 200&#8197;K and a spectrum measured at 10&#8197;K is compatible with a possible &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; structure featuring an imidazole ring and a bi&#8208;dentate Asp residue in the Cu coordination site.







Abstract
The redox activity of Cu ions bound to the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide is implicated as a source of oxidative stress in the context of Alzheimer's disease. In order to explain the efficient redox cycling between CuII&#8208;A&#946; (distorted square&#8208;pyramidal) and CuI&#8208;A&#946; (digonal) resting states, the existence of a low&#8208;populated &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; state, prone to bind Cu in both oxidation states, has been postulated. Here, we exploited the partial X&#8208;ray induced photoreduction at 10&#8197;K, followed by a thermal relaxation at 200&#8197;K, to trap and characterize by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) a partially reduced Cu&#8208;A&#946;1&#8211;16 species different from the resting states. Remarkably, the XAS spectrum is well&#8208;fitted by a previously proposed model of the &#8220;in&#8208;between&#8221; state, hence providing the first direct spectroscopic characterization of an intermediate state. The present approach could be used to explore and identify the catalytic intermediates of other relevant metal complexes.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of Platinum in Hybrid&#8208;Nanoparticle Assemblies for use in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, we found that the contact of small Pt nanoparticles with large Au or Ag nanoparticles changes the Fermi level of Pt. This change could tune the performance of Pt catalysts in electrocatalytic water splitting.







Abstract
Platinum is the best electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we demonstrate that by contact electrification of Pt nanoparticle satellites on a gold or silver core, the Fermi level of Pt can be tuned. The electronic properties of Pt in such hybrid nanocatalysts were experimentally characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with the probe molecule 2,6&#8208;dimethyl phenyl isocyanide (2,6&#8208;DMPI). Our experimental findings are corroborated by a hybridization model and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that tuning of the Fermi level of Pt results in reduced or increased overpotentials in water splitting.

         <title>A Time&#8208;Resolved FRET Assay Identifies a Small Molecule that Inhibits the Essential Bacterial Cell Wall Polymerase FtsW</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FtsW is a newly discovered peptidoglycan polymerase essential for cell division. We developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay, which we used to screen a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a small molecule that inhibits FtsW in vitro. Using a fluorescently labeled, non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound displaces Lipid&#8197;II from FtsW.







Abstract
The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival. To form the cell wall, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) polymerize Lipid&#8197;II to make glycan strands and then those strands are crosslinked by transpeptidases (TPs). Recently, the SEDS (for shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins were identified as a new class of PGTs. The SEDS protein FtsW, which produces septal peptidoglycan during cell division, is an attractive target for novel antibiotics because it is essential in virtually all bacteria. Here, we developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay to monitor PGT activity and screened a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a compound that inhibits S.&#8197;aureus FtsW in vitro. Using a non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid&#8197;II derivative, we showed that this compound competes with Lipid&#8197;II for binding to FtsW. The assays described here will be useful for discovering and characterizing other PGT inhibitors.

The spontaneous cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamines to thiazolines and its application to the efficient and epimerization&#8208;free synthesis of thiazoline&#8208;containing peptides is described.

Abstract
Herein we report a mild, efficient, and epimerization&#8208;free method for the synthesis of peptide&#8208;derived 2&#8208;thiazolines and 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazines based on a cyclodesulfhydration of N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptoethylamine or N&#8208;thioacyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropylamine derivatives. The described reaction can be easily carried out in aqueous solutions at room temperature and it is triggered by change of the pH, leading to complex thiazoline or dihydrothiazine derivatives without epimerization in excellent to quantitative yields. The new method was applied in the total synthesis of the marine metabolite mollamide&#8197;F, resulting in the revision of its stereochemistry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric P&#8722;C Coupling of Secondary Phosphine Oxides and Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular dynamic kinetic asymmetric P&#8722;C coupling of secondary phosphine oxides and aryl iodides is catalyzed by copper complexes with a carefully tuned diamine ligand. The reaction features a broad substrate scope and affords the corresponding products with high yields and enantioselectivities. Versatile transformations of these products gave diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are valuable in asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective P&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs) is an attractive method for synthesizing P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds, but the development of such a dynamic kinetic asymmetric process remains a considerable challenge. Here we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic intermolecular P&#8722;C coupling of SPOs and aryl iodides catalyzed by copper complexes ligated by a finely modified chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. The reaction tolerates a wide range of SPOs and aryl iodides, affording P&#8208;stereogenic tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) in high yields and with good enantioselectivity (average 89.2&#8201;%&#8201;ee). The resulting enantioenriched TPOs were transformed into structurally diverse P&#8208;chiral scaffolds, which are highly valuable as ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Dual Photochemical H&#8208;Atom Transfer and Cobalt Catalysis for the Desaturative Synthesis of Phenols from Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic photocatalytic H&#8208;atom transfer and cobalt dual catalysis enables the desaturative synthesis of phenols from cyclohexanone derivatives by formal removal of four H&#8208;atoms.







Abstract
Phenols are integral aromatic molecules widely encountered in the structure of natural products and routinely utilised for the synthesis of high&#8208;value materials. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult, especially when their functionalization pattern does not match the intrinsic reactivity leveraged by electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Here, we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach for phenol synthesis using saturated cyclohexanone precursors. This process operates at ambient temperature, under simple purple light irradiation, and features a dual catalytic manifold carrying four sequential H&#8208;atom transfer processes.

         <title>Elucidation of a Dearomatization Route in the Biosynthesis of Oxysporidinone Involving a TenA&#8208;like Cytochrome P450 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dearomative biosynthetic route from sambutoxin to oxysporidinone in Fusarium oxysporum, in which two enzymes act sequentially and repeatedly on the phenol moiety of the substrate, was elucidated. OsdM, a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 enzyme, oxidizes the phenol ring and forms a [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN then catalyzes two successive ene reduction steps, which are followed by another hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by OsdM.







Abstract
Oxidative dearomatization of phenols is an important transformation for synthesis of complex molecules. Oxysporidinone and related 2&#8208;pyridones feature a hydroxy&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone ring, which has been proposed to form by phenol dearomatization, although the details of the biochemical process are still unknown. In this study, we identified the oxysporidinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum by regulator activation and gene knockout studies. Through in vivo and in vitro studies, we confirmed that the phenol dearomatization process involves two enzymes. OsdM, a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 with expected ring&#8208;expansion activity, converts the phenol ring and the 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone core into an unexpected fused [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN, on the other hand, catalyzes two successive ene reduction reactions, followed by hydroxylation by OsdM. This new route enriches current knowledge on enzymatic phenol dearomatization and the mechanism of TenA&#8208;like P450s.

         <title>C64 Nanographene Tetraimide&#8212;A Receptor for Phthalocyanines with Subnanomolar Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble and thus challenging to dissolve as monomers in solution. Here a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy is described to solubilize phthalocyanines in organic solvents by complexation with a C64 nanographene tetraimide. A subnanomolar binding affinity of C64 nanographene&#8211;phthalocyanine complex allowed the capture of phthalocyanines into the solution phase.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are extensively used by the dye and pigment industry and in photovoltaic and photodynamic therapy research due to their intense absorption of visible light, outstanding stability, and versatility. As pigments, the unsubstituted phthalocyanines are insoluble owing to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions, which causes limitations for the solution chemistry for both free base and metalated phthalocyanines. Here we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to dissolve phthalocyanines into solution. C64 nanographene tetraimide (1) binds two free base/zinc/copper phthalocyanines in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry to solubilize phthalocyanines as evidenced by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis absorption and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Binding studies using a tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted soluble phthalocyanine revealed binding affinities of up to 109&#8197;M&#8722;1 in tetrachloromethane, relating to a Gibbs free energy of &#8722;52&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Energy decomposition analysis revealed that complexes between 1 and phthalocyanines are stabilized by dispersion interactions followed by electrostatics as well as significant charge&#8208;transfer interactions.

         <title>Access to Polysulfides through Photocatalyzed Dithiosulfonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a general photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane with dithiosulfonates. The resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is an excellent nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, which can react with a variety of electrophiles to access unsymmetric disulfides efficiently.







Abstract
In this study, we outline a general method for photocatalyzed difunctionalization of alkenes, a diene, alkynes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and [1.1.1]propellane using dithiosulfonate reagents (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) with improved atom economy. Both &#8220;ArSO2&#8208;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8208;SSR&#8221; on the dithiosulfonate are transferred under mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high stereoselectivity, and complete regioselectivity. Significantly, the resulting dithiosulfonylated styrene is a general and practical nucleophilic disulfuration reagent, reacting with a variety of electrophiles efficiently. Both reactions can be conducted on gram scale, rendering the approach highly valuable.

         <title>Comprehensive Study of the Enhanced Reactivity of Turbo&#8208;Grignard Reagents

By adding LiCl to a Grignard reagent one can easily enhance the reactivity of these widely used organometallic reagents. While numerous examples of this extraordinary reactivity are reported, the reactive species stayed hidden. By using structural elucidation in the solid state and in solution, we were able not only to identify a reactive species but also to prove its mechanistic value by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Since its introduction in 2004, Knochel's so called Turbo&#8208;Grignard reagents revolutionized the usage of Grignard reagents. Through the simple addition of LiCl to a magnesium alkyl an outstanding increase in reactivity can be achieved. Though the exact composition of the reactive species remained mysterious, the reactive mixture itself is readily used not only in synthesis but also found its way into more distant fields like material science. To unravel this mystery, we combined single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction with in&#8208;solution NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and closed our investigations with quantum chemical calculations. Using such a variety of methods, we have gained insight into and an explanation for the extraordinary reactivity of this extremely convenient reagent by determining the structure of the first bimetallic reactive species [t&#8208;Bu2Mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;thf] with two tert&#8208;butyl anions at the magnesium center and incorporated lithium chloride.

         <title>Preserving Macroporosity in Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macropore&#8208;containing Type III porous liquid (PL) is prepared through a hierarchical filler design strategy. The 4&#8197;&#197; micropores in the hollow metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), function as a perfect size&#8208;exclusion barrier to prevent PDMS from occupying the inner cavities. Thus, it can reversibly host and release up to 27&#8197;wt&#8201;% water which enables its thermal conductivity to be tuned, making it a rare example of liquid thermal switch.







Abstract
Preserving large permanent pore structures in a fluid may endow conventional liquids with emergent physical properties. However, such materials are challenging to make because of the tendency of the pores to be filled and occupied by the solvent molecules. Here, we report the design and synthesis of the first Type III porous liquid (PL) containing uniform yet stable 480&#8197;nm cavities. This was achieved by first constructing a single crystalline hollow metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, through chemical etching. The thin yet defect&#8208;free MOF shell effectively excludes the bulky poly(dimethylsiloxane) solvent molecules from entering the cavity through its 4&#8197;&#197; aperture, resulting in the preservation of both micro&#8208; and macroporosity in the PL. These enormous void spaces allow the PL to reversibly host and release up to 27&#8197;wt&#8201;% water for up to 10&#8197;cycles. The switching between the &#8220;dry&#8221; state and the &#8220;wet&#8221; state led to a large changes of the thermal conductivity of the PL from 0.140 to 0.256&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, affording a guest&#8208;responsive liquid thermal switch with a switching ratio of 1.8.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole alkaloids are of great interest to organic and medicinal chemists and material scientists. This unique direct C&#8722;H functionalization has enabled efficient derivatization of commercially available carbazoles in a highly site&#8208;selective manner via a unique six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate. This reaction boasts good functional group compatibility and displays distinct reactivities based on C3&#8208;substituents of unsymmetrical substrates.







Abstract
Carbazole alkaloids hold great potential in pharmaceutical and material sciences. However, the current approaches for C1 functionalization of carbazoles rely on the use of a pre&#8208;installed directing group, severely limiting their applicability and hindering their overall efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time the development of direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and acylation of carbazoles assisted by norbornene (NBE) as a transient directing mediator. Notably, the involvement of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate was suggested in this case, representing the first example of such intermediacy within the extensively studied Pd/norbornene reactions realm.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Redox Properties of Heteroleptic Molybdenum Complexes through Ligand&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Cooperativity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;ligand cooperativity is introduced as a novel option for fine&#8208;tuning redox properties of molecular complexes. The effect was found when combining dithiolene and 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligands in one complex. During electrochemical measurements, a non&#8208;covalent interaction in the second ligand&#8208;sphere results in an electronic conversation between both ligands, which has an unprecedented impact on the observed redox transitions.







Abstract
Heteroleptic molybdenum complexes bearing 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane (P2N2) and non&#8208;innocent dithiolene ligands were synthesized and electrochemically characterized. The reduction potentials of the complexes were found to be fine&#8208;tuned by a synergistic effect identified by DFT calculations as ligand&#8208;ligand cooperativity via non&#8208;covalent interactions. This finding is supported by electrochemical studies combined with UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent NMR spectroscopy. The observed behavior is reminiscent of enzymatic redox modulation using second ligand sphere effects.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Internal Hydrogen Bonds of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Acid Sites in the Zeolite H&#8208;MFI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use chemically accurate quantum mechanical (QM) methods to study the Br&#248;nsted acid site heterogeneity due to aluminum substitution in different crystallographic positions of H&#8208;MFI. We assign free Br&#248;nsted acid sites (blue) to observed OH stretching vibrations and 1H NMR shifts at around 3610&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 4&#8197;ppm, respectively, and H&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (orange) to the signals observed at around 3250&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 7&#8197;ppm, respectively.







Abstract
The location of Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid sites (bridging OH groups, b&#8208;OH) at different crystallographic positions of zeolite catalysts influences their reactivity due to varying confinement. Selecting the most stable b&#8208;OH conformers at each of the 12 T&#8208;sites (T=Si/Al) of H&#8208;MFI, a representative set of 26 conformers is obtained which includes free b&#8208;OH groups pointing into the empty pore space and b&#8208;OH groups forming H&#8208;bonds across five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered rings of TO4 tetrahedra. Chemically accurate coupled&#8208;cluster&#8208;quality calculations for periodic models show that the strength of internal H&#8208;bonds and, hence, the OH bond length vary substantially with the framework position. For 11 of the 19 H&#8208;bonded b&#8208;OH groups examined, our predictions fall into the full width at half maximum range of the experimental signals at 3250&#177;175&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 7.0&#177;1.4&#8197;ppm which supports previously debated assignments of these signals to H&#8208;bonded b&#8208;OH sites.

We assign free Br&#248;nsted acid sites (blue) to observed OH stretching vibrations and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR shifts at around 3610&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4&#8197;ppm, respectively, and H-bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (orange) to the signals observed at around 3250&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 7&#8197;ppm, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of Br&#248;nsted-acid sites (bridging OH groups, b-OH) at different crystallographic positions of zeolite catalysts influences their reactivity due to varying confinement. Selecting the most stable b-OH conformers at each of the 12 T-sites (T=Si/Al) of H-MFI, a representative set of 26 conformers is obtained which includes free b-OH groups pointing into the empty pore space and b-OH groups forming H-bonds across five- or six-membered rings of TO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. Chemically accurate coupled-cluster-quality calculations for periodic models show that the strength of internal H-bonds and, hence, the OH bond length vary substantially with the framework position. For 11 of the 19 H-bonded b-OH groups examined, our predictions fall into the full width at half maximum range of the experimental signals at 3250&#177;175&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 7.0&#177;1.4&#8197;ppm which supports previously debated assignments of these signals to H-bonded b-OH sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Methanol induces a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefins. The products of these formal (3+3) cycloaddition reactions, quinoidal tetrazines, are strong organic reducing agents.







Abstract
The head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization of N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefins is described. The products of these formal (3+3) cycloaddition reactions are strongly reducing quinoidal tetrazines. Oxidation of the tetrazines occurs in a stepwise fashion, and we were able to isolate a stable radical cation and diamagnetic dications. The latter are also accessible by oxidative dimerization of diazoolefins.

The development of aryl alkyl sulfides as dichotomous electrophiles for the site&#8208;selective silylation via C&#8722;S bond cleavage has been achieved.

         <title>Practical Antibody Recruiting by Metabolic Labeling with Caged Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a glycan&#8208;display approach that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile method for editing cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting in the presence of their antibodies, demonstrating the practical utility of the caging strategy in glycocalyx editing.







Abstract
We propose a de novo glycan display approach that combines metabolic labeling and a glycan&#8208;caging strategy as a facile editing method for cell&#8208;surface glycans. This method enables the introduction of antigen glycans onto cancer cells to induce immune responses through antibody recruiting. The caging strategy prevents the capture of &#945;&#8208;rhamnose (an antigen glycan) by endogenous antibodies during the introduction of the glycan to the targeted cell surface, and subsequent uncaging successfully induces immune responses. Therefore, this study proposes a practical method for editing the cell&#8208;surface glycocalyx under promiscuous conditions, such as those in vivo, which paves the way for the development of glycan function analysis and regulation.

         <title>A Simple, Selective, and General Catalyst for Ring Closing Depolymerization of Polyesters and Polycarbonates for Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters and polycarbonates are depolymerized using the combination of zinc dichloride and polyethylene glycol as a catalyst under reactive distillation conditions carried out at temperatures significantly below the ceiling temperature of the polymers evaluated. Selective polyester depolymerization occurred in the presence of other polymer classes, thereby demonstrating the promise for using the chemistry for the chemical recycling of plastics.







Abstract
The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl2 and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (Tc&gt;200&#8201;&#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl2 per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol). In addition to being general for a wide variety of polyesters and polycarbonates, the catalyst system could selectively depolymerize a polyester in the presence of other commodity plastics, demonstrating how reactive distillation using the ZnCl2/PEG600 catalyst system can be used to separate mixed plastic waste.

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Chiral Tricyclic Lactams by Tandem Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Reductive Amination/Lactamization Using Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and economical one&#8208;pot approach to chiral fused tricyclic lactams from readily available ketoesters was developed by using cheap ammonium salts as the nitrogen source through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed tandem dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination/lactamization. This protocol provides highly efficient access to drug intermediates and organocatalysts containing chiral polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
The atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient synthesis of chiral fused tricyclic lactams from readily available ketoesters using cheap ammonium salts as the nitrogen source is reported. This ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed system operates through an efficient tandem dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive amination (ARA)/lactamization and produces chiral fused tricyclic lactams in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr and 98&#8201;% yield). The robust method was also applied to the concise synthesis of key intermediates in the synthesis of rivastigmine analogues and chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysts.

The robust method was also applied to the concise synthesis of key intermediates in the synthesis of rivastigmine analogues and chiral N-heterocyclic carbene catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formal &#947;&#8722;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Cyclobutyl Ketones: Synthesis of cis&#8208;1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;C functionalization strategy was reported to effect the otherwise challenging synthesis of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutane building blocks. Numerous aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups can be installed at the 3&#8208;position of the cyclobutane ring with exclusive cis&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Difunctionalized cyclobutanes are an emerging scaffold in medicinal chemistry that can confer beneficial pharmacological properties to small&#8208;molecule drug candidates. However, the diastereocontrolled synthesis of these compounds typically requires complicated synthetic routes, indicating a need for novel methods. Here, we report a sequential C&#8722;H/C&#8722;C functionalization strategy for the stereospecific synthesis of cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;functionalized cyclobutyl ketones from readily available cyclobutyl aryl ketones. Specifically, a bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol intermediate is generated from the parent cyclobutyl ketone via an optimized Norrish&#8208;Yang procedure. This intermediate then undergoes a ligand&#8208;enabled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cleavage/functionalization to produce valuable cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;(hetero)arylated, alkenylated, and alkynylated cyclobutyl aryl ketones, the benzoyl moiety of which can subsequently be converted to a wide range of functional groups including amides and esters.

         <title>Isolated Electron Trap&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Mo atoms in a high oxidation state have been incorporated into the lattice of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS@Mo) nanorods, which exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 11.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Experimental and theoretical simulation results imply that the highly oxidized Mo species lead to mobile&#8208;charge imbalances in CZS and induce the directional photogenerated electrons transfer, resulting in effectively inhibited electron&#8208;hole recombination and greatly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven evolution of hydrogen from water using particulate photocatalysts is considered one of the most economical and promising protocols for achieving a stable supply of renewable energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting is far from satisfactory due to the sluggish electron&#8208;hole pair separation kinetics. Herein, isolated Mo atoms in a high oxidation state have been incorporated into the lattice of Cd0.5Zn0.5S (CZS@Mo) nanorods, which exhibit photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 11.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (226.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1; catalyst dosage 20&#8197;mg). Experimental and theoretical simulation results imply that the highly oxidized Mo species lead to mobile&#8208;charge imbalances in CZS and induce the directional photogenerated electrons transfer, resulting in effectively inhibited electron&#8208;hole recombination and greatly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of a P450 Dimerase Enables the Collective Biosynthesis of Heterodimeric Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Diketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 25, June 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of heterodimeric tryptophan&#8208;containing diketopiperazines (HTDKPs) is restricted by the limited substrate scopes of the HTDKP&#8208;forming P450 dimerases. Engineering of three important residues (F387, F388, and E73) in NasF5053 significantly expanded its substrate specificity and enabled the collective biosynthesis of at least 93 HTDKPs.







Abstract
Heterodimeric tryptophan&#8208;containing diketopiperazines (HTDKPs) are an important class of bioactive secondary metabolites. Biosynthesis offers a practical opportunity to access their bioactive structural diversity, however, it is restricted by the limited substrate scopes of the HTDKPs&#8208;forming P450 dimerases. Herein, by genome mining and investigation of the sequence&#8208;product relationships, we unveiled three important residues (F387, F388 and E73) in these P450s that are pivotal for selecting different diketopiperazine (DKP) substrates in the upper binding pocket. Engineering these residues in NasF5053 significantly expanded its substrate specificity and enabled the collective biosynthesis, including 12&#8197;self&#8208;dimerized and at least 81 cross&#8208;dimerized HTDKPs. Structural and molecular dynamics analysis of F387G and E73S revealed that they control the substrate specificity via reducing steric hindrance and regulating substrate tunnels, respectively.

         <title>Tailoring Extremely Narrow FWHM in Hypsochromic and Bathochromic Shift of Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin MR&#8208;TADF Materials for High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing double boron&#8208;based emitters with extremely narrow band spectrum and high efficiency in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is crucial and challenging. Herein, we report two materials, NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, based on polycyclic heteraborin skeletons by role&#8208;play of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The NO&#8208;DBMR contains an oxygen atom, whereas the Cz&#8208;DBMR has a carbazole core in the double boron&#8208;embedded &#957;&#8208;DABNA structure. The synthesized materials resulted in an unsymmetrical pattern for NO&#8208;DBMR and surprisingly a symmetrical pattern for Cz&#8208;DBMR. Consequently, both materials showed extremely narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 14 nm in hypsochromic (pure blue) and bathochromic (Bluish green) shifted emission without losing their high color fidelity. Furthermore, both materials show high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of over 82%, and an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) of 0.04 eV, resulting in high&#160;kRISC&#160;of 105 s&#8722;1. Due to the efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, the&#160; OLEDs based on&#160;heteraborins manifested maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 33.7 and 29.8% for NO&#8208;DBMR and Cz&#8208;DBMR, respectively. This is the first work reported with this type of strategy for achieving an extremely narrow FWHM in hypsochromic and bathochromic shifted emissions with a similar molecular skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of Cysteine&#8208;Lysine Covalent Linkage &#8208; The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Competition with Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, a new naturally occurring covalent linkage was characterised, involving a cysteine and a lysine, bridged through an oxygen atom. The latter was dubbed as the NOS bond, reflecting the individual atoms involved in this uncommon bond which finds little parallel in lab chemistry. It is found to form under oxidising conditions and reversible upon addition of reducing agents. Further studies have identified the bond in crystal structures across a variety of systems and organisms, potentially playing an important role in regulation, cellular defense and replication. Not only that, double NOS bonds have been identified and even found to be competitive in relation to the formation of disulfide bonds. This raises several questions about how this exotic bond comes to be, what are the intermediates involved in its formation and how it competes with other pathways of sulfide oxidation. With this objective in mind, we revisited our first proposed mechanism for the reaction with model electronic structure calculations, adding information about the reactivity with alternative reactive oxygen species and other potential competing products of oxidation. We present a network with more than 30 reactions which provides one of the most encompassing pictures for cysteine oxidation pathways to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Stability and Outgassing Behaviors of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiNiO2&#8208;based high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes are regarded as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density automotive lithium batteries. Most of the attention thus far has been paid towards addressing their surface and structural instability issues brought by the increase of Ni content (&gt; 90%) with an aim to enhance the cycle stability. However, the poor safety performance remains an intractable problem for their commercialization in the market, yet it has not received appropriate attention. In this review, we focus on the gas generation and thermal degradation behaviors of high&#8208;Ni cathodes, which are critical factors in determining their overall safety performance. A comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of outgassing and thermal runaway reactions is presented and analyzed from a chemistry perspective. Finally, we discuss the challenges and the insights into developing robust, safe high&#8208;Ni cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Synthesis and Concurrent Immobilization of Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks on Electrodes Using an Electrogenerated Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous materials with prospective uses in various devices. However, general bulk synthetic methods usually produce COFs as powders that are insoluble in most of the common organic solvents, arising challenges for the subsequent molding and fixing of these materials on substrates.&#160;Here, we report a novel synthetic methodology that utilizes an electrogenerated acid (EGA), which is produced at an electrode surface by electrochemical oxidation of a suitable precursor, acting as an effective Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst for imine bond formation from the corresponding amine and aldehyde monomers. Simultaneously, it provides the corresponding COF film deposited on the electrode surface. The COF structures obtained with this method exhibited high crystallinities and porosities, and the film thickness could be controlled. Furthermore, such process was applied for the synthesis of various imine&#8208;based COFs, including a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydrodifluoromethylation of alkynes with BrCF2H via nickel catalysis is described. This protocol proceeds via a migratory insertion of nickel hydride to alkyne followed by a CF2H&#8208;coupling, enabling straightforward access to diverse branched CF2H&#8208;alkenes with high efficiency and exclusive regioselectivity. The mild condition applies to a wide array of aliphatic and aryl alkynes with good functional group compatibility.

         <title>A Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Pathologically Activated Assay for Efficient Bioorthogonal Catalytic Selective Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since polyoxometalates (POMs) can undergo reversible multi&#8208;electron redox transformations, they have been used to modulate the electronic environment of metal nanoparticles for catalysis. Besides, POMs possess unique electronic structures and acid&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly ability. These properties inspire us to tackle the drawbacks of the well&#8208;known copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction when applied in biomedical applications, such as low catalytic efficiency and unsatisfactory disease selectivity in living systems. Herein, we construct the molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;based POM nanoclusters doped with Cu (Cu&#8208;POM NCs) as a highly efficient bioorthogonal catalyst, which is responsive to pathologically acid and H2S for selective antibiofilm therapy. Leveraging the merits of POM, the Cu&#8208;POM NCs exhibit biofilm&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assemble behavior, efficient CuAAC reactions&#8208;mediated in situ synthesis of antibacterial molecules, and NIR&#8208;II photothermal effect selectively triggered by H2S in pathogens. It should be noted that the consumption of bacterial H2S at the pathological site by Cu&#8208;POM NCs extremely decreases the number of persister bacteria, which is conducive to the inhibition of bacterial tolerance and elimination of biofilms. Unlocked at pathological sites and endowed with NIR&#8208;II photothermal property, the constructed POM&#8208;based bioorthogonal catalytic platform provides new insights into the design of efficient and selective bioorthogonal catalysts for disease therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic 2&#8208;Iodoethanol Coupling to Produce 1,4&#8208;Butanediol Mediated by TiO2 and a Catalytic Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic 2&#8208;iodoethanol (IEO) coupling provides 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO) of particular interest to produce degradable polyesters. However, the reduction potential of IEO is too negative (&#8722;1.9 vs NHE) to be satisfied by most of the semiconductors, and the kinetics of transferring one electron for IEO coupling is slow. Here we design a Ni&#8208;complex cocatalyst, which works synergistically with TiO2, realizing reductive coupling of IEO powered by photo&#8208;energy. Coordinating by terpyridine stabilizes Ni2+ from being photo&#8208;deposited to TiO2, thereby retaining the steric configuration beneficial for IEO coupling. The Ni&#8208;complex can rapidly extract electrons from TiO2, generating a low&#8208;valent Ni capable of reducing IEO. The photocatalytic IEO coupling thus provides BDO in 72% selectivity. By a stepwise procedure, BDO is obtained with 70% selectivity from ethylene glycol. This work put forward a strategy for the photocatalytic reduction of molecules requiring strong negative potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Anthracene&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated nanoribbons attract interest because of their unusual electronic structures and charge&#8208;transport behavior. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of fully edge&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;anthracene oligomeric ribbons (dimer and trimer), together with a computational study of the corresponding infinite polymer. The porphyrin dimer and trimer were synthesized in high yield, via oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of singly linked precursors, using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). The crystal structure of the dimer shows that the central &#960;&#8208;system is flat, with a slight S&#8208;shaped wave distortion at each porphyrin terminal. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation causes a dramatic red&#8208;shift in the absorption spectra: the absorption maxima of the fused dimer and trimer appear at 1188 nm and 1642 nm, respectively (for the nickel complexes dissolved in toluene). The coordinated metal in the dimer was changed from Ni to Mg, using p&#8208;tolylmagnesium bromide, providing access to free&#8208;base and Zn complexes. These results open a versatile avenue to longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanoribbons with integrated metalloporphyrin units.</dc:description>

         <title>Methane Oxidation over Cu2+/[CuOH]+ Pairs and Site&#8208;Specific Kinetics in Copper Mordenite Revealed by Operando Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and UV&#8208;Visible Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite (MOR) is a promising material for partial CH4 oxidation. The structural diversity of Cu species within MOR makes it difficult to identify the active Cu sites and to determine their redox and kinetic properties. In this study, the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;MOR materials with different Cu loadings has been determined using operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy as well as in situ photoluminescence (PL) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A novel pathway for CH4 oxidation involving paired [CuOH]+ and bare Cu2+ species has been identified. The reduction of bare Cu2+ ions facilitated by adjacent [CuOH]+ demonstrates that the frequently reported assumption of redox&#8208;inert Cu2+ centers does not generally apply. The measured site&#8208;specific reaction kinetics show that dimeric Cu species exhibit a faster reaction rate and a higher apparent activation energy than monomeric Cu2+ active sites highlighting their difference in the CH4 oxidation potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles with Chlorodiazirines: Synthetic Methodology and Thermal Hazard Assessment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that arylchlorodiazirines serve as photo&#8208;activated halocarbene precursors for the selective one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of N&#8208;substituted pyrroles and indoles to the corresponding pyridinium and quinolinium salts. Preliminary investigations indicate that the same strategy also enables the conversion of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles to pyrimidinium salts. The N&#8208;substituent of the substrate plays an essential role in: (1) increasing substrate scope by preventing product degradation, (2) enhancing yields by suppressing co&#8208;product inhibition, and (3) activating the azinium products towards subsequent synthetic manipulations. This latter point is illustrated by subjecting the quinolinium salts to four complementary partial reductions, which provide concise access to ring&#8208;expanded products with different degrees of increased C(sp3) character. Thermal analysis of the diazirines by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) provides detailed insight into their energetic properties, and highlights the safety benefits of photolyzing &#8211; rather than thermolyzing &#8211; these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Induced Large Electronic Conductivity Change of 107&#160;on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Sensitive Water Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic conductivity (EC) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is sensitive to guest molecules with strong oxidation. Water, nearly ubiquitous, is a relatively mild species, however the effect of H2O on the EC of MOFs is rarely reported. Herein, we explored the effect of H2O on EC in representative MOFs, (NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and its derivatives, by experimental and theoretical investigations. Unexpectedly, a large EC increase of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 by H2O was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed between the &#8208;NH2 and H2SO4 played an important role in promoting the charge transfer from H2O to MOF and resulted in large change in the EC. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, an high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensing material was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range and lowest limit of detection amongst all the reported sensing materials. This work not only demonsrate that H2O with a weak oxidation nature could remarkably influence the EC of MOFs, but it also revealed that the post&#8208;modification of the structure of MOFs could enhance the influence of the guest molecule on their EC to design high&#8208;performance sensing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted TADF Molecules and Their Applications in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters has become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress of highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and overviewed the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and relative OLEDs are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long-term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro-1,6- hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in-situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the -CF2- hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb-related and I-related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer-incorporated devices are 24.76% (0.09 cm2) and 20.66% (14 cm2).

         <title>Vibration&#8208;driven Reduction of CO2&#160;to Acetate with 100% Selectivity by SnS Nanobelt Piezocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 chemicals such as acetate with high selectivity and efficiency is a critical issue in renewable energy storage. Herein, for the first time we present a vibration&#8208;driven piezocatalysis with tin (II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts for conversion of CO2 to acetate with 100% selectivity, and the highest production rate (2.21 mM h&#8722;1) compared with reported catalysts. Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built&#8208;in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8208;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran&#8208;new strategy for converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products with efficient, low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Boost Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane: Nickel&#8211;Platinum Nanoparticles Supported on Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Titania</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia borane (AB) is a promising material for chemical H2 storage owing to its high H2 density (up to 19.6 wt%). However, the development of an efficient catalyst for driving H2 evolution through AB hydrolysis remains challenging. Therefore, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for generating H2 through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8211;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus&#8208;doped TiO2 (Ni&#8211;Pt/P&#8208;TiO2) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P&#8208;TiO2 was prepared by phytic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8211;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co&#8208;reduction strategy. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation at 283 K, Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8 molH2&#8729;molPt&#8208;1&#8729;min&#8208;1. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 originated from a combination of the Ni&#8211;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal&#8211;semiconductor interface, and strong metal&#8211;support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB&#8208;hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal&#8211;support interactions for other visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we show the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/Cu(II) complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six continuous stereocenters was generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the in situ formed 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2 and/or C3 substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion, and reveal the originations of the stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Emitters Enable High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Red Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Didoes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are receiving significant attention and have demonstrated impressive performance in blue and green OLEDs. However, developing high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs remains a highly desired yet challenging task. Herein, we have developed narrowband red fluorescent emitters by utilizing a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton in combination with a methyl&#8208;shield strategy. These emitters exhibit small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) ranging from 21 nm (0.068 eV) to 25 nm (0.081 eV) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) ranging from 88.5% to 99.0% in toluene solution. Using BODIPY&#8208;based luminescent materials as emitters, high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs have been assembled with external quantum efficiency as high as 18.3% at 623 nm and 21.1% at 604 nm. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first successful case of achieving NTSC pure&#8208;red OLEDs with the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of [0.67, 0.33] based on conventional fluorescent emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroatomic&#8208; and heptagons&#8208; doped multiple helicenes were successfully synthesized and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which exhibit distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circular dichroism (CD) signals, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron-doped heptagon-containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz-NBN with two nitrogen-boron-nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz-NBN-P1 bearing two NBN-doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two-fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz-NBN and 4Cz-NBN-P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz-NBN-P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz-NBN-P1-F1) to yellow (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-4Cz-NBN-P1-F2) with near-unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spiro&#8208;type hole transport material (HTM) was developed by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system (DP). The new HTM features a stabilized HOMO level, a higher glass transition temperature, and improved morphology on the perovskite layer compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. When incorporated into an n&#8208;i&#8208;p device, the DP&#8208;based HTM achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area (0.06&#8197;cm2) devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules (designated area of 27.56&#8197;cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78&#8201;% on a designated area of 27.86&#8197;cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1&#8201;% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2560&#8197;hours and 87&#8201;% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600&#8197;hours.

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent engineering of dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine&#8208;based fluorophores was demonstrated to access broadband triple fluorescent emissions from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm. Mechanistic studies revealed that the steric effect modulates the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface, enabling the molecule to undergo multistep transformation along the sequence of bent, planar, and twisted structures.







Abstract
We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt;500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, the introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized Terthiophene Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although main group redox systems are attractive as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, achieving high cell voltages via extreme redox couples typically compromises their long&#8208;term stabilities. We show that phosphine oxide functionalization can render terthiophenes robust two&#8208;electron acceptors at very low potentials, thus opening fundamentally new parameter space in the search for stable main group redox systems with high cell voltages.







Abstract
Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8722; reductions at potentials below &#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc=ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2&#8201;e&#8722; galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2&#8201;e&#8722; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzimidazoles Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a conceptually new, highly efficient radical route for the benzimidazole synthesis via radical&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols and o&#8208;arylenediamines concomitantly with hydrogen (H2) production over Pd modified ultrathin ZnO NSs (Pd/ZnO) under mild conditions.







Abstract
Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). The mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8208;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazole synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.

         <title>Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one&#8208;pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.







Abstract
Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease&#8208;relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one&#8208;pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with TiIV ions and a membrane&#8208;penetrating peptide, octa&#8208;arginine R8+, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on&#8208;bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to TiIV ion&#8208;only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra&#8208;sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We explored its clinical application of monitoring the outcome of chemotherapy of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with a small volume of CSF, presenting a powerful tool for broad clinical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one-pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease-relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one-pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; ions and a membrane-penetrating peptide, octa-arginine R&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on-bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; ion-only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra-sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial synapse where non&#8208;relevant biomolecules (urea, lactic acid (LA) and fructose (Fru)) cannot modulate its plasticity, while only relevant biomolecules (glucose) can selectively activate the device and induce long&#8208;term modulation and memory effect. The device works properly in blood serum and shows enhanced synaptic behaviors at high glucose concentrations, suggesting its potential application as artificial neurons in vivo.







Abstract
The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The systematic high&#8208;throughput investigation of the system AlCl3/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O led to the discovery of a series of porous salts from readily available starting materials in high yields. In situ crystallisation studies confirm the rapid formation of the highly crystalline compounds within minutes under mild conditions.







Abstract
The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, HSO4&#8722;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt;95&#8201;%, 215&#8197;g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 430&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140&#8197;nm and 1250&#8197;nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

         <title>Alkali Chloride Adducts of Acyclic Acylaluminum: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. The reaction of the acylaluminums with TMSOTf and DMAP gave a ring&#8208;expanded iminium&#8208;substituted aluminate and a 2&#8208;C&#8722;H cleaved product. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated. Throughout the study, acyclic acylaluminums exhibited higher reactivity than that of the cyclic dimer.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework birefringent crystal exhibits strikingly large birefringence of exp. 0.60@550&#8197;nm. This attribute would enable it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Alkoxide Powered Zincation of Fluoroarenes Employing Zinc Bis&#8208;Amide Zn(TMP)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the metalation potential of Zn(TMP)2 the addition of KOtBu enables the activation of its amide groups to promote the regioselective zincation of a range of fluoroarenes forming higher order potassium zincates. This methodology can even be extended to non&#8208;activated arenes toluene and benzene under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Reminiscent of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser superbase recipes, the addition of two molar equivalents of KOtBu to Zn(TMP)2 (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) transforms this mild zinc bis&#8208;amide base to a powerful metalating agent able to perform facile regioselective zincation of a wide range of sensitive fluoroarenes. Structural authentication of the intermediates post Zn&#8722;H exchange demonstrates activation of both TMP groups to form a range of higher order bis&#8208;aryl potassium zincates, isolable as solids and further functionalized in electrophilic interception reactions. Studies assessing the role of KOtBu reveal that the first equivalent undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Zn(TMP)2, enabling kinetic activation of the amide groups; whereas the second equivalent stabilizes the metalated intermediate preventing ligand redistribution. Showcasing its metalating power, this bimetallic KOtBu/Zn(TMP)2 partnership, can effect zincation of toluene and benzene at room temperature.

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel architecture with FeP nanodots fully embedded in nitrogen doped carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) . Such a structure allows the stress transfer between FeP nanodots and self&#8208;adaptive carbon matrix in sodium storage, which overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), which outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated iontronic nanotool was developed for the study of single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation. With the nanotool, an N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;modified deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) was used for profiling a representative m6&#8197;A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO), which also released a DNA sequence that could be programmed as an antisense strand against intracellular FTO&#8208;mRNA.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell studies; however, solutions to epigenetic questions remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within a nanopipette for profiling a representative m6A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.

         <title>Design of the Ionic Organic Nonlinear Optical Material NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4] with Ultrawide Band Gap and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent organic flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit, through reasonable nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;favourable layered design, a deep&#8208;ultraviolet ionic organic nonlinear optical crystal, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], with an ultrawide band gap and moderate birefringence was successfully obtained.







Abstract
Ionic organic crystals containing organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units has become one of the hot spots as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although this type of ionic organic NLO crystals commonly have remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, they also suffer from overlarge birefringences and relatively small band gaps that be hardly beyond 6.2&#8197;eV. Herein, a flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit was theoretically revealed, showing great potential for designing NLO crystals with balanced optical properties. Accordingly, through the reasonable NLO&#8208;favourable layered design, a new ionic organic material, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], was successfully obtained. As expected, it achieves not only a large SHG effect (4&#215;KDP), but also a suitable birefringence (0.06@546&#8197;nm) and an ultrawide band gap (&gt;6.5&#8197;eV). This study provides a new flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO&#8208;active unit, contributing to design more ionic organic NLO materials with excellent balanced optical properties.

The largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4) is prepared. It is a disc&#8208;shaped structure, its Ag69 kernel consists of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 wrapped by six Ino decahedral Ag13 units through edge&#8208;sharing. The central silver atom has an unprecedented high coordination number of 14. This is the first time that Ino decahedra act as building blocks to assemble a supercluster.







Abstract
The reduction of alkynyl&#8208;silver and phosphine&#8208;silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph2SiH2 led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc&#8208;shaped cluster has a Ag69 kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 unit wrapped by six Ino decahedra through edge&#8208;sharing. This is the first time that Ino decahedra are used as a building block to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for understanding metal cluster assembling mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;The reduction of alkynyl-silver and phosphine-silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag&lt;sub&gt;93&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (R=4-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc-shaped cluster has a Ag&lt;sub&gt;69&lt;/sub&gt; kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; unit wrapped by six Ino decahedra through edge-sharing. This is the first time that Ino decahedra are used as a building block to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for understanding metal cluster assembling mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation and Hydroalkynylation of Alkenes Enabled by a Transient Directing Group: Catalyst Generality through Rigidification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of tert&#8208;leucine as a chiral transient directing group enables the enantioselective reductive&#8208;Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl benzaldehydes under palladium catalysis. The dual catalytic reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the &#948;&#8208;position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies reveal the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between the ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40 A cm&#8722;2 at 800 &#176;C and 2.0 V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Structure with Enhanced Anionic Coordination for Stable Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries have garnered much attention due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the irreversible lithium plating/stripping on the anode limits their performance, which has been paid little attention. Herein, a solvation&#8208;regulated strategy for stable lithium anodes in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) based electrolyte is attempted in Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Trifluoroacetate anions (TFA&#8208;) with strong Li+ affinity are incorporated into the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/G4 electrolyte to attenuate the Li+&#8208;G4 interaction and form anion&#8208;dominant solvates. The bisalt electrolyte with 0.5 M LiTFA and 0.5 M LiTFSI mitigates G4 decomposition and induces an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This contributes to decreased desolvation energy barrier from 58.20 to 46.31 kJ mol&#8208;1, compared with 1.0 M LiTFSI/G4, for facile interfacial Li+ diffusion and high efficiency. It yields extended lifespan of 120 cycles in Li&#8208;O2 battery with a limited Li anode (7 mAh cm&#8208;2). This work gains comprehensive insights into rational electrolyte design for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8208;, or a combination of CF3S./CF3. species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArSOCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7 &#8211; 12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insights, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein. This work contributes to a better understanding of HS&#8208;protein interactions and provides a useful tool for the development of anti&#8208;heparanase therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Chemistry Derived Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes Working at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 and 20 mAh cm&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is crucial for lithium metal anode (LMA) to survive in long&#8208;term cycling. However, chaotic structures and chemical inhomogeneity of natural SEI make LMA suffer from exasperating dendrite growth and severe electrode pulverization, hindering the practical application of LMAs. Here, we design a catalyst&#8208;derived artificial SEI layer with an ordered polyamide (PA)&#8208;LiOH (PA&#8208;LiOH) bi&#8208;phase structure to modulate ion transport and enable dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition. The PA&#8208;LiOH layer can substantially suppress the volume changes of LMA during cyclic Li plating/stripping, as well as the parasitic reactions between LMA and electrolyte. The optimized LMAs demonstrate excellent stability in cyclic Li plating/stripping tests for over 1000 hours at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20 mA [[EQUATION]] in Li||Li symmetric cells. A high coulombic efficiency up to 99.2% in Li half cells under additive&#8208;free electrolyte is achieved even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1mA cm&#8208;2 with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimeric Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkenylation of Alkynes with a Versatile Silicon&#8208;Based Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, branched&#8208;selective hydroalkenylation of terminal alkynes, under mild conditions through facile installation of a versatile silanol as a removable directing group. With an alkenyl boronic acid as the coupling partner, this reaction produces stereodefined (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with high regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The protocol features mild reaction conditions such as room temperature and an air atmosphere, while maintaining excellent functional group compatibility. The resulting 1,3&#8208;dienesilanol products serve as versatile building blocks, as the removal of the silanol group allows for the synthesis of both branched terminal 1,3&#8208;dienes for downstream coupling reactions, as well as stereoselective construction of linear (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and (E,E,E)&#8208; or (E,E,Z)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienes. In addition, a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition can smoothly and selectively deliver silicon&#8208;containing pentasubstituted cyclohexene derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, in conjunction &#160;with DFT calculations, suggest a bimetallic synergistic activation model to account for the observed enhanced catalytic efficiency and good regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Histidine&#8208;Rich Peptides Enhance Endosomal Escape for Antibody&#8208;Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal&#160;entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome&#8208;to&#8208;cytosol delivery based on an extension of the "histidine switch" principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity. These peptides that do not penetrate cells randomly (like CPPs) yet do imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16&#8208;residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and successively achieved antibody&#8208;targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes &#8212;including the pro&#8208;apoptotic protein BID (BH3&#8208;interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase &#8212;into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab&#8208;hsLMWP&#8208;BID fusion conferred strong anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Capacity Degradation of Ge Anode Triggered by Interfacial LiH Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Germanium (Ge), as a fast&#8208;charging and high specific capacity (1568 mAh g&#8722;1) alloy anode, is greatly hampered in practical application by poor cyclability. To date, the understanding of cycling performance degradation remains elusive. This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li4Ge2H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever&#8208;growing and ever&#8208;insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of SEI is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li4Ge2H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparative Scale Applications of C&#8211;H Activation in Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H activation is an attractive methodology to increase molecular complexity without requiring substrate prefunctionalization. In contrast to well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling methods, C&#8211;H activation is less explored on large scales and its use in the production of pharmaceuticals faces substantial hurdles. However, the inherent advantages, such as shorter synthetic routes and simpler starting materials, motivate medicinal chemists and process chemists to overcome these challenges, and exploit C&#8211;H activation steps for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. In this review, we will cover examples of drugs/drug candidates where C&#8211;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale (range between 355 mg and 130 kg). The optimization processes will be described, and each example will be examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages, providing the reader with an in&#8208;depth understanding of the challenges and potential of C&#8211;H activation methodologies in the production of pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of the Bacterial Sesterviridene Synthase from Kitasatospora viridis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gene coding for a terpene synthase homolog from Kitasatospora viridis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein possessed sesterterpene synthase activity and efficiently converted geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP) with 19% yield into the sesterterpene hydrocarbon sesterviridene A. Large scale enzymatic conversions also allowed for the isolation of two side products that are generated with very low yields of ca. 0.1%. Several derivatives of sesterviridene A were obtained by chemical transformations, securing the NMR&#8208;based structural assignments. The absolute configuration of sesterviridene A was determined by chemical correlation using stereoselectively deuterated precursors and by anomalous dispersion X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cyclisation mechanism from GFPP to sesterviridene A was extensively studied through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamical Equilibrium between Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Sites in Zeolites: Framework&#8208;Associated Octahedral Aluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the structures of Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites are well understood, those of Lewis acid sites (LAS) remain an active area of investigation.&#160;Under hydrated conditions, the reversible formation of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum has been observed in zeolites in the acidic form.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the structures of Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites are well understood, those of Lewis acid sites (LAS) remain an active area of investigation.&#160;Under hydrated conditions, the reversible formation of framework-associated octahedral aluminum has been observed in zeolites in the acidic form. However, the structure and formation mechanisms are currently unknown. In this work, combined experimental&#160;27Al NMR spectroscopy and computational data reveal for the first time the details of the zeolite framework-associated octahedral aluminium.

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Directed Proximity&#8208;Driven Crosslinking Method for Native Peptide Bicyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and site&#8208;specific modification of native peptides and proteins is desirable for synthesizing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates as well as for constructing chemically modified peptide libraries using genetically encoded platforms such as phage display. In particular, there is much interest in efficient multicyclization of native peptides due to the appeals of multicyclic peptides as therapeutics. However, conventional approaches for multicyclic peptide synthesis require orthogonal protecting groups or non&#8208;proteinogenic clickable handles. Herein, we report a cysteine&#8208;directed proximity&#8208;driven strategy for the constructing bicyclic peptides from simple natural peptide precursors. This linear to bicycle transformation initiates with rapid cysteine labeling, which then triggers proximity&#8208;driven amine&#8208;selective cyclization. This bicyclization proceeds rapidly under physiologic conditions, yielding bicyclic peptides with a Cys&#8208;Lys&#8208;Cys, Lys&#8208;Cys&#8208;Lys or N&#8208;terminus&#8208;Cys&#8208;Cys stapling pattern. We demonstrate the utility and power of this strategy by constructing bicyclic peptides fused to proteins as well as to the M13 phage, paving the way to phage display of novel bicyclic peptide libraries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this article we report that a cationic version of Akiba&#8217;s Bi(III) complex catalyzes the reduction of amides to amines using silane as hydride donor. The catalytic system features low catalyst loadings and mild conditions, en route to secondary and tertiary aryl&#8208; and alkylamines. The system permits that functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, ester, nitrile, furan, and thiophene remain intact. Kinetic studies on the reaction mechanism result in the identification of a reaction network with an important product inhibition that is in agreement with the experimental reaction profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Ring&#8208;Opening Dihydroboration of Arylidenecyclopropanes to Access Skipped Diboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening dihydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access synthetically versatile skipped diboronates with catalysts generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and dpephos or xantphos. A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Comparison of Lysine versus Site&#8208;Specific Protein Surface Immobilization in Single&#8208;molecule Mechanical Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force&#8208;transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site&#8208;specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site&#8208;specific vs. lysine&#8208;based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine&#8208; vs. ybbR&#8208;based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine&#8208;based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin&#8208;biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin&#8208;Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site&#8208;specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface&#8208;bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on&#160;in vivo&#8208;derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Heteroatom&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Bridging Electron Transport in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Supramolecular System for Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular systems consisting of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and Ni complex are designed for robust photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Multiple heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonding between the COF and Ni complex is identified to play a decisive role in the photoexcited electron transfer across the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The diminution of steric groups on COF or metal complex can optimize catalytic performance, which is more attributable to the enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction rather than their intrinsic activity. The photosystem with relatively strong strength of hydrogen bonds exhibits remarkable photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, far superior to photosystems with supported atomic Ni or metal complex alone in the absence of hydrogen&#8208;bond effect. Such heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway confers supramolecular system with high photocatalytic performance, providing an avenue to rationally design efficient and steadily available photosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photosensitizer Coupled Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we innovatively assembled two types of traditional photosensitizers, that is pyridine ruthenium/ferrum (Ru(bpy)32+/Fe(bpy)32+) and porphyrin/metalloporphyrin complex (2HPor/ZnPor) by covalent linkage to get a series of dual photosensitizer&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs), which behaved strong visible light&#8208;absorbing ability, efficient electron transfer and suitable band gap for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution. Rubpy&#8208;ZnPor COF achieved the highest H2 yield (30338 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8208;1) with apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.68%@420 nm, which showed one of the best performances among all reported COF based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ produced H2 was successfully tandem used in the alkyne hydrogenation with ~99.9% efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that both the two photosensitizer units in MCOFs can be photoexcited and thus contribute optimal photocatalytic activity. This work develops a general strategy and shows the great potential of using multiple photosensitive materials in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum Metallacycle&#8208;Based Molecular Recognition: Establishment and Application in Spontaneous Formation of a [2]Rotaxane with Light&#8208;Harvesting Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic molecule&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems, which provide contributions for the design and construction of functional supramolecular structures, have gained increasing attention in recent years. In particular, platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems provide opportunities for chemical scientists to prepare&#160;novel&#160;materials with various functions and structures due to the well&#8208;defined shapes and cavity sizes of platinum(II) metallacycles. However, the research on platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems has received less attention. In this article, we demonstrate the host&#8211;guest complexation between a platinum(II) metallacycle and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule, naphthalene. Taking advantage of metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest interactions and the dynamic covalent chemistry in the formation of reversible Pt coordination bonds, a [2]rotaxane is efficiently prepared by employing a template&#8208;directed clipping procedure. The [2]rotaxane is further applied to the fabrication of&#160;&#160;an efficient light&#8208;harvesting system with multi&#8208;step energy transfer process. This work comprises an important supplement to macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems and demonstrates a strategy for efficient production of well&#8208;defined mechanically interlocked molecules with practical values.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Large Pore Apertures and High Surface Areas for NO2 Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with pronounced electrical properties (e. g., high conductivity) has provided a novel platform for efficient energy storage, sensing, and electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the limited availability of suitable ligands restricts the number of available types of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, especially those with large pore apertures and high surface areas are rare. Herein, we develop two new 2D c&#8208;MOFs (HIOTP&#8208;M, M = Ni, Cu) employing a large p&#8208;&#960; conjugated ligand of hexaamino&#8208;triphenyleno[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b':10,11&#8208;b'']tris[1,4]benzodioxin (HAOTP). Among the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, HIOTP&#8208;Ni exhibits the largest pore aperture of 3.3 nm and one of the highest surface areas (up to 1300 m2 g&#8208;1). As an exemplary application, HIOTP&#8208;Ni has been used as a chemiresistive sensing material and displays high selective response (405%) and a rapid response (1.69 min) towards 10 ppm NO2 gas. This work demonstrates significant correlation linking the pore aperture of 2D c&#8208;MOFs to their sensing performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystal LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x + y + z = 1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77% capacity retention below 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56% for 4.7 V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO&#8208;type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition&#8208;metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock&#8208;salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modelling analysis further indicate that the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Ultrasmall Recyclable Iridium(0) Nanoparticles for Regioselective Aromatic Hydrogenation of Phosphine Oxide Scaffolds: An Easy Access to New Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed the recyclable ligand&#8208;free Ir&#8208;H based Ir(0) nanoparticles (NPs) for the first regioselective partial hydrogenation of P(V)&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. Both the isolated and in&#8208;situ generated NPs are catalytically active. Control NMR study revealed the presence of metal&#8217;s surface&#8208;bound hydrides, most likely formed from Ir(0) species. A control NMR study confirmed that HFIP as a solvent was accountable for substrate activation via hydrogen bonding. HRTEM analysis of the catalyst supports the formation of ultrasmall NPs, while XPS analysis confirmed the dominance of Ir(0) in the NPs. The catalytic activity of NPs is broad as showcased by highly regioselective aromatic ring reduction in various phosphine oxides or phosphonates. The study also showcased a novel pathway toward preparing H8&#8208;BINAP and its derivatives without losing enantioselectivity during catalytic events.</dc:description>

         <title>An Implantable Fiber Biosupercapacitor with High Power Density by Multi&#8208;Strand Twisting Functionalized Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable fiber biosupercapacitor with high power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is created by design of a multi&#8208;strand twisted structure. It can be successfully operated in vivo and is demonstrated to achieve the electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve.







Abstract
Biosupercapacitors (BSCs) that can harvest and store chemical energy show great promise for power delivery of biological applications. However, low power density still limits their applications, especially as miniaturized implants. Here, we report an implantable fiber BSC with maximal power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the previous reports. The fiber BSC was fabricated by integrating anode and cathode fibers of biofuel cell with supercapacitor fibers through multi&#8208;strand twisting. This twisting structure endowed many channels inside and high electrochemical active area for efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer among different fibers, benefiting high power output. The obtained thin and flexible fiber BSC operated stably under deformations and performed high biocompatibility after implantation. Eventually, the fiber BSC was implanted subcutaneously in rats and successfully realized electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve, showing promise as a power source in vivo.

         <title>Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;Enabled Cell&#8208;Surface Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling toward More Efficient Capture of Physically Interacting Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;1O2&#8208;hydrazide system is a photocatalytic proximity labeling system on the cell surface, which enables a more efficient capture of physically interacting cells. This system can be employed to identify trace cellular interactions and serves as a &#8220;live&#8221; TCR multimer to discriminate dendritic cells presenting different antigens, which paves the way for exploring the heterogeneity of antigen&#8208;presenting cells.







Abstract
Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)32+ to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru&#8208;mediated PPL. Ru(bpy)32+ catalysts with different cell&#8208;anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on primary cells. Finally, based on this system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR&#8208;T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.

Finally, based on this system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR-T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Merging Styrene and Diene Structures to a Cyclic Diene: Anionic Polymerization of 1&#8208;Vinylcyclohexene (VCH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic living polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH) with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator in cyclohexane is possible. It is a key question whether the monomer acts as a 1,3&#8208;diene or as a styrenic monomer. The cyclic structure of the 1,2&#8208;substituted monomer shows extraordinary consequences on copolymerization behavior, microstructure and thermal behavior, compared to other conventional linear dienes (e.g. butadiene, isoprene).







Abstract
We report the first anionic polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH). This structure may be considered as an intermediate between dienes and styrene. The polymerization of this cyclic 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;diene proceeded quantitatively in cyclohexane at 25&#8201;&#176;C with sec&#8208;butyllithium as an initiator. The obtained polymers have well&#8208;controlled molecular weights in the range of 5 to 142&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, controlled by the molar ratio of monomer and initiator, with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#272;&lt;1.07&#8211;1.20). In situ 1H NMR kinetic characterization revealed a weak gradient structure for the copolymers of styrene and VCH, (rSty=2.55, rVCH=0.39). P(VCH) obtained in cyclohexane with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator showed both 1,4&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;incorporation mode (ratio: 64&#8201;:&#8201;36). It was demonstrated that the microstructure of the resulting P(VCH) can be altered by the addition of a modifier (THF), resulting in increasing 3,4&#8208;microstructure (up to 78&#8201;%) and elevated glass&#8208;transition temperature up to 89&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, the monomer VCH polymerizes carbanionically like a diene, however leading to rigid polymers with high glass transition temperature, which provides interesting options for combination with other dienes to well&#8208;defined polymer architectures and materials.

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion through Coupling Spin Crossover and Rhombus Deformation in a Hexanuclear {FeIII4FeII2} Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexanuclear spin crossover compound [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1) was synthesized by assembling the spin crossover FeII units and asymmetric Ppmp ligands into a rhombic core structure. It showed the colossal positive and negative anisotropic thermal expansion coupled with spin transition.







Abstract
Colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion is a key function for microscale or nanoscale actuators in material science. Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1, Tp*=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate and Ppmp=2&#8208;[3&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {FeIII2FeII2}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1 underwent thermally&#8208;induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The FeII site in 1 behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the FeII centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {FeIII2FeII2} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.

         <title>Coronaviruses Use ACE2 Monomers as Entry&#8208;Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
dSTORM imaging shows that the entry&#8208;receptor ACE2 of coronaviruses is homogeneously distributed in the plasma membrane of host cells with expression levels of only 1&#8211;2 ACE2 molecules&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2. In contrast to previous reports that suggested binding of multiple spikes per virus to ACE2 homodimers or oligomers our data reveal that ACE2 is expressed as monomer in the plasma membrane in the absence and presence of trimeric spike proteins.







Abstract
The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as entry receptor on cells enabling binding and infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) via trimeric spike (S) proteins protruding from the viral surface. It has been suggested that trimeric S proteins preferably bind to plasma membrane areas with high concentrations of possibly multimeric ACE2 receptors to achieve a higher binding and infection efficiency. Here we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in combination with different labeling approaches to visualize the distribution and quantify the expression of ACE2 on different cells. Our results reveal that endogenous ACE2 receptors are present as monomers in the plasma membrane with densities of only 1&#8211;2 receptors &#956;m&#8722;2. In addition, binding of trimeric S proteins does not induce the formation of ACE2 oligomers in the plasma membrane. Supported by infection studies using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing S proteins our data demonstrate that a single S protein interaction per virus particle with a monomeric ACE2 receptor is sufficient for infection, which provides SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 a high infectivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Deoxidizing Electrolyte Additive Enables Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a major cause of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitation during battery resting, usually attributed to protons. To tackle DO&#8208;induced issues, a chemical strategy for self&#8208;deoxygenation is proposed. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive, effectively improving the stability of Zn in aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, the Zn anode suffers from severe corrosion reactions and consequent dendrite growth troubles that cause fast performance decay. Herein, we uncover the corrosion mechanism and confirm that the dissolved oxygen (DO) other than the reputed proton is a principal origin of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitates, especially during the initial battery resting period. In a break from common physical deoxygenation methods, we propose a chemical self&#8208;deoxygenation strategy to tackle the DO&#8208;induced hazards. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced to aqueous electrolytes as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive. As a result, the Zn anode sustains a long&#8208;term cycling of 2500&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 1100&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 together with a high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6&#8201;%. The full cells also show a high capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. Our findings provide a renewed understanding of Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes and also a practical solution towards industrializing aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb&#8208;Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermoelectric properties of the EuCuSb&#8208;EuZn0.5Sb solid solution. Vacancies in the planar honeycomb lattice cause a decrease in sound velocity and a sharp increase in point defect scattering, which combine to yield an 80&#8201;% decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition varies from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.







Abstract
AMX compounds with the ZrBeSi structure tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50&#8201;% on the M&#8208;site in the planar MX&#8208;layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu1&#8722;xZn0.5xSb solid solution. The transition from a fully&#8208;occupied honeycomb layer (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn0.5Sb) leads to non&#8208;linear bond expansion in the honeycomb layer, increasing atomic displacement parameters on the M and Sb&#8208;sites, and significant lattice softening. This, combined with a rapid increase in point defect scattering, causes the lattice thermal conductivity to decrease from 3 to 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The effect of vacancies on the electronic properties is more nuanced; we see a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as we go from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.

         <title>Covalently Linked Hexakis(m&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Macrocycles as Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing organic nanotubes with defined lengths was developed by designing and synthesizing macrocycles with a &#946;&#8208;alanine linker. Oligomeric hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) macrocycles with four macrocyclic units as molecular nanotubes can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;s.







Abstract
The construction of nanotubular structures with non&#8208;deformable inner pores is of both fundamental and practical significance. Herein we report a strategy for creating molecular nanotubes with defined lengths. Macrocyclic (MC) units based on shape&#8208;persistent hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (m&#8208;PE) macrocycle MC&#8208;1, which are known to stack into hydrogen&#8208;bonded tubular assemblies, are tethered by oligo(&#946;&#8208;alanine) linkers to give tubular stacks MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 that have two and four MC units, respectively. The covalently linked MC units in MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 undergo face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking through intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions that further results in the helical stacks of these compounds. Oligomer MC&#8208;4 can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;seconds, which is among the longest open durations for synthetic ion channels and indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the self&#8208;assembling channels can be drastically enhanced by reducing the number of molecular components involved. This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 suggest the likelihood of constructing the next&#8208;generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.

         <title>Photocurrent Generation and Polarity Switching in Electrochemical Cells through Light&#8208;induced Excited State Proton Transfer of Photoacids and Photobases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism for photocurrent generation is introduced utilizing an excited state proton transfer (ESPT) mechanism of photoacids and photobases. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer. Tandem irradiation of the photoacid&#8208;photobase is resulting in polarity switching in an H&#8208;cell photoelectrochemical configuration.







Abstract
Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light&#8208;harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light&#8208;responsive energy production or energy storage.

         <title>Multistate Aggregation&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Properties of Enantiopure Disulfide&#8208;Mediated Bispyrene Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective double thiol&#8208;ene addition onto a bis enol ether macrocycle provides chiral disulfide bispyrene macrocycles able to exhibit excimer aggregation&#8208;induced emission predominantly. Upon increasing the water content, ECD and CPL monitoring evidence multistate chiroptical properties, rationalized by TDDFT calculations. Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films and AFM studies help decipher the organization of the luminophores at the interface of water.







Abstract
A chiral bispyrene macrocycle designed for exclusive intermolecular excimer fluorescence upon aggregation was synthesized by a double hydrothiolation of a bis&#8208;enol ether macrocycle followed by intramolecular oxidation of free thiols. Unusually high stereoselectivity was achieved for the thiol&#8208;ene additions under templated conditions and Et3B/O2 radical initiation. After enantiomer separation (chiral stationary phase HPLC), aqueous conditions provoked aggregation. Detailed structural evolution was afforded by ECD/CPL monitoring. Three regimes can be observed and characterized by strong modifications in chiroptical patterns under, at, or above a 70&#8201;% H2O&#8201;:&#8201;THF threshold. In luminescence, high glum dissymmetry factors values were obtained, up to 0.022, as well as a double sign inversion of CPL signals during the aggregation, a behavior rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Langmuir layers of enantiopure disulfide macrocycles were formed at the air&#8211;water interface and transferred onto solid substrates to afford Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films, which were then studied by AFM and UV/ECD/fluorescence/CPL.

         <title>A Triply [5]Helicene&#8208;Bridged (1,3,5)Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,3,5)cyclophane has been synthesized, in which the triply locked central benzene rings are parallel to each other, perfectly superimposed and rather close. These two benzene rings show abnormally low aromaticity, which is possibly due to the existence of an aromatic 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron macrocyclic circuit.







Abstract
A rigid propeller&#8208;shaped conjugated triple macrocycle consisting of two nearly perfectly stacked benzene rings and three linking [5]helicene moieties has been synthesized using a glyoxylic Perkin approach. Analysis of the electron delocalization in this atypical aromatic molecule revealed global aromaticity and a 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuit along the edge of its triple loop, to the detriment of the two 6&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuits in the two stacked benzene rings.

         <title>Sulfur Poisoning and Self&#8208;Recovery of Single&#8208;Site Rh1/Porous Organic Polymer Catalysts for Olefin Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even at the ppm level, sulfur poisoning and regeneration are challenges for metal nanoparticle catalysts, but little is known about single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts. Herein, we describe the unique character of single&#8208;site catalysts (Rh1/POPs) that suffer from H2S poisoning, but could self&#8208;recover and be regenerated by simply withdrawing the H2S. The corresponding Rh nanoparticle demonstrated poor activity and could not be regenerated.







Abstract
Sulfur poisoning and regeneration are global challenges for metal catalysts even at the ppm level. The sulfur poisoning of single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts and their regeneration is worthy of further study. Herein, sulfur poisoning and self&#8208;recovery are first presented on an industrialized single&#8208;Rh&#8208;site catalyst (Rh1/POPs). A decreased turnover frequency of Rh1/POPs from 4317&#8197;h&#8722;1 to 318&#8197;h&#8722;1 was observed in a 1000&#8197;ppm H2S co&#8208;feed for ethylene hydroformylation, but it self&#8208;recovered to 4527&#8197;h&#8722;1 after withdrawal of H2S, whereas the rhodium nanoparticles demonstrated poor activity and self&#8208;recovery ability. H2S reduced the charge density of the single Rh atom and lowered its Gibbs free energy with the formation of inactive (SH)Rh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2, which could be regenerated to active HRh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2 after withdrawing H2S. The mechanism and the sulfur&#8208;related structure&#8211;activity relationship were highlighted. This work provides an understanding of heterogeneous ethylene hydroformylation and sulfur&#8208;poisoned regeneration in the science of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Radical Coupling Initiated by Organophosphine Addition to Ynoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining established two electron nucleophilic catalysis of organophosphines with photoredox organocatalysis has allowed the discovery of a mechanistically unusual Giese coupling reaction. In addition to addressing a limitation in traditional photoredox coupling with electron&#8208;poor alkynes these studies demonstrate the viability of reaction designs that merge traditional nucleophilic phosphines organocatalysis and photoredox events.







Abstract
Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.

         <title>Diazoalkenes: From an Elusive Intermediate to a Stable Substance Class in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Early discoveries of diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) in organic synthesis and the identification of room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes since 2021 are summarized in this Minireview. The synthesis, properties, and reactivity of this novel molecule class are presented, and its use in organic synthesis, main&#8208;group, and transition&#8208;metal chemistry highlighted.







Abstract
Over decades diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) were postulated as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry even though their direct spectroscopic detection proved very challenging. In the 1970/80ies several groups probed their existence mainly indirectly by trapping experiments or directly by matrix&#8208;isolation studies. In 2021, our group and the Severin group reported independently the synthesis and characterization of the first room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes, which initiated a rapidly expanding research field. Up to now four different classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic substituted room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes have been reported. Their properties and unique reactivity, such as N2/CO exchange or utilization as vinylidene precursors in organic and transition metal chemistry are presented. This review summarizes the early discoveries of diazoalkenes from their initial postulation as transient, elusive species up to the recent findings of the room&#8208;temperature stable derivatives.

         <title>Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Pro&#8208;nanomodulators for Deep&#8208;Tissue Sono&#8208;immunotherapy of Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulator is developed for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Upon ultrasound activation, the polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulator generates singlet oxygen to cause immunogenic cell death and unleash immunomodulators for promoting antitumor immunity, leading to elimination of progression and metastasis of orthotopic pancreatic tumors, and alleviation of immune&#8208;related adverse events.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has provided a promising modality for cancer treatment, while it often has the issues of limited response rates and potential off&#8208;target side effects in clinical practice. We herein report the construction of semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulators (SPpMs) with ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated activatable pharmacological actions for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Such SPpMs consist of a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer backbone grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) chains linked with two immunomodulators (a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 blocker and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase inhibitor) via a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable segment. In view of the excellent sonodynamic property of the semiconducting polymer core, SPpMs enable effective generation of 1O2 under US treatment, even in a deep&#8208;tissue depth up to 12&#8197;cm. The generated 1O2 not only ablates tumors via a sonodynamic effect and induces immunogenic cell death, but also destroys the 1O2&#8208;cleavable segments to allow in situ release of immunomodulators in tumors. This synergetic action results in boosted antitumor immune response via reversing two tumor immunosuppressive pathways. As such, SPpMs mediate deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy to completely eradicate orthotopic pancreatic cancer and effectively prevent tumor metastasis. Moreover, such an immune activation reduces the possibility of immune&#8208;related adverse events. This study thus provides a smart activatable nanoplatform for precise immunotherapy of deep&#8208;seated tumors.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation of Polyesters to Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new upcycling strategies to address the threats from waste plastics can significantly improve global sustainability. An atom economic reaction was demonstrated to convert polyesters into diols with great selectivity over a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. The reaction could be operated in solvent&#8208;free mode with all atoms in the reactants fixed into the final product, eliminating the need for a separation process.







Abstract
The utilization of carbon resources stored in plastic polymers through chemical recycling and upcycling is a promising approach for mitigating plastic waste. However, most current methods for upcycling suffer from limited selectivity towards a specific valuable product, particularly when attempting full conversion of the plastic. We present a highly selective reaction route for transforming polylactic acid (PLA) into 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilizing a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. This reaction exhibits excellent reactivity (0.65&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99.5&#8201;%) towards 1,2&#8208;propanediol, and most importantly, can be performed in a solvent&#8208;free mode. Significantly, the overall solvent&#8208;free reaction is an atom&#8208;economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H2) fixed into the final product (1,2&#8208;propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high&#8208;purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.

Significantly, the overall solvent-free reaction is an atom-economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fixed into the final product (1,2-propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high-purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement of Diaryliodonium Salts in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement featuring an aryl transfer from I to C pathway was developed, where no metal&#8208; or photo&#8208;catalysts are needed. The interaction between ionic liquids and diaryliodonium salts largely contributed to the efficiency of the reaction under mild conditions. This method furnished 64&#8197;examples of sulfonyl substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as potentially valuable building blocks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is an intramolecular SNAr reaction, enabling the formation of a new arene carbon&#8208;carbon bond with sufficiently strong carbon&#8208;centered nucleophile. Reported here are ortho&#8208;tosylmethylene functionalized diaryliodonium salts, which can undergo an unprecedented Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement in ionic liquids, resulting in sulfonyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as a powerful class of building blocks in chemical synthesis. The protocol features aryliodo moiety as a hyper nucleofuge, facilitating the formation of Meisenheimer complex within the migratory system.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine 1&#8208;Imines via RuII/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization of sulfondiimines with sulfoxonium ylides using a RuII catalyst and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, thus expanding the accessible chemical space of chiral hexavalent organosulfur scaffolds relevant to biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;photoluminescent (PL) CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). The MSCs evolve from their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are relatively transparent in optical absorption. The non&#8208;absorbing PCs assist the transformation of the absorbing MSCs. Monomer substitution is involved in the PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization, and monomer addition in the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation.







Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor II&#8211;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at &#8776;322&#8197;nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373&#8197;nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.

         <title>Carrier Protein Mediated Formation of the Dihydropyridazinone Ring in Actinopyridazinone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinopyridazinone biosynthesis represents a unique biochemical transformation of an amino acid. It involves N&#947;&#8208;amination of DABA using alanine as a nitrogen donor. An acetyl hydrazone intermediate undergoes an unprecedented carrier protein mediated heterocyclization to give a dihydropyridazinone. This is a sophisticated biosynthetic strategy in which an acetylation temporarily protects the reactive hydrazone during biosynthesis.







Abstract
Heterocycles with nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bonds are privileged building blocks of synthetic drugs. They are also found in natural products, although the biosynthetic logic behind them is poorly understood. Actinopyridazinones produced by Streptomyces sp. MSD090630SC&#8208;05 possess unique dihydropyridazinone rings that have been studied as core nuclei in several approved synthetic therapeutics. Herein, we performed gene knockouts and in vitro biochemical experiments to elucidate the major steps in actinopyridazinone biosynthesis, including the unprecedented carrier protein mediated machinery for dihydropyridazinone formation.

         <title>Linking Composition, Structure and Thickness of CoOOH layers to Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity by Correlative Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our correlative multimodal approach can link local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, morphology and composition of surface species formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that a 6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) layer, grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, contains more hydroxyl ions and easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites, exhibiting a higher OER activity than 3&#8197;nm thick &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) formed on [02
&#8208;oriented Co.







Abstract
The role of &#946;&#8208;CoOOH crystallographic orientations in catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains elusive. We combine correlative electron backscatter diffraction/scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to establish the structure&#8211;activity relationships of various faceted &#946;&#8208;CoOOH formed on a Co microelectrode under OER conditions. We reveal that &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0), grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, exhibits higher OER activity than &#8776;3&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) or &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(0006) formed on [02
&#8208; and [0001]&#8208;oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites present in &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre&#8208;catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.

- and [0001]-oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O sites present in &#946;-CoOOH(01
0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic-scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre-catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8211;acetylene interactions adopting a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode enabled the synthesis of concave polyhedral cages upon anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;triggered interconversion of highly entangled polyhedra. In their Communication (e202303714), Yuya Domoto and co&#8208;workers describe skeletally edited 3D architectures having partially disconnected knot or link motifs at their polyhedral faces.

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment via hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Upon the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir&#8208;O and Ir&#8208;OO&#8208; intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate&#8208;limiting step of Ir&#8208;O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) have aroused great interest globally with their unique electrochemical, catalytic, and mechanical properties, as well as diverse activity and multielement tunability for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis method at atmospheric pressure is employed to synthesize Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell NPs with a single phase of face&#8208;centred cubic structure for promoting the oxidation of C1 and C2 alcohols. Interestingly, the lattice of both Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell enlarge during the formation process of HEA, with tensile strains included in the core and shell of HEA. Strikingly, the as&#8208;made PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Especially, the specific (mass) activity of PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs for MOR is 4.7 mA/cm2 (2874 mA mg(Pd+Pt)&#8208;1), about 1.7 (5.9) and 1.5 (4.8) times higher than that of commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Combined with high&#8208;entropy effect, Pt sites and Pd sites on the interface of the HEA act synergistically to facilitate the multi&#8208;step process towards EOR. This study offers a promising way to find a feasible route for scalable HEA manufacturing with promising applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure and Metal&#8208;confining Carbon Nanotubes through Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide in Ca&#8208;based Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To be successfully implemented, an efficient conversion, affordable operation and high values of CO2&#8208;derived products by electrochemical conversion of CO2 are yet to be addressed. Inspired by the natural CaO&#8211;CaCO3 cycle, we herein introduce CaO into electrolysis of SnO2 in affordable molten CaCl2&#8211;NaCl to establish an in situ capture and conversion of CO2. In situ capture of anodic CO2 from graphite anode by the added CaO generates CaCO3. The consequent co&#8208;electrolysis of SnO2 and CaCO3 confines Sn in carbon nanotube (Sn@CNT) in cathode and increases current efficiency of O2 evolution in graphite anode to 71.9%. The intermediated CaC2 is verified as the nuclei to direct a self&#8208;template generation of CNT, ensuring a CO2&#8211;CNT current efficiency and energy efficiency of 85.1% and 44.8%, respectively. The Sn@CNT integrates confined responses of Sn cores to external electrochemical or thermal stimuli with robust CNT sheaths, resulting in excellent Li storage performance and intriguing application as nanothermometer. The versatility of the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in Ca&#8208;based molten salts for template&#8208;free generation of advanced carbon materials is evidenced by the successful generation of pure CNT, Zn@CNT and Fe@CNT.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable van der Waals Heterostructures through Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method is demonstrated for the preparation of high&#8208;quality van der Waals heterostructures in solution through an electrochemical strategy. The produced van der Waals heterostructures exhibit strong interlayer coupling, extraordinary structural integrity, large lateral dimension and good optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWHs) have recently gained widespread attention because of their abundant and exotic properties, which open up many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, practical applications remain challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput techniques for fabricating high&#8208;quality vdWHs. Here, we demonstrate a general electrochemical strategy to prepare solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;quality vdWHs, in which electrostatic forces drive the stacking of electrochemically exfoliated individual assemblies with intact structures and clean interfaces into vdWHs with strong interlayer interactions. Thanks to the excellent combination of strong light absorption, interfacial charge transfer, and decent charge transport properties in individual layers, thin&#8208;film photodetectors based on graphene/In2Se3 vdWHs exhibit great promise for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection, owing to a high responsivity (267&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1), fast rise (72&#8197;ms) and decay (426&#8197;ms) times under NIR illumination. This approach enables various hybrid systems, including graphene/In2Se3, graphene/MoS2 and graphene/MoSe2 vdWHs, providing a broad avenue for exploring emerging electronic, photonic, and exotic quantum phenomena.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoboxes Enable Accelerated Redox Kinetics and Polysulfide Trapping for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems in view of the high theoretical energy density and low cost of sulfur resources. The suppression of polysulfide diffusion and promotion of redox kinetics are the main challenges for Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we design and prepare a novel type of ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) to serve as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The hollow architecture of ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can ensure fast charge transfer, improved sulfur utilization, and effective confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The atomically dispersed Co&#8208;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can firmly capture LiPSs and electrocatalytically accelerate their conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple structural advantages, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and superior cycling stability for 300 cycles.</dc:description>

The suppression of polysulfide diffusion and promotion of redox kinetics are the main challenges for Li-S batteries. Herein, we design and prepare a novel type of ZnCo-based bimetallic metal-organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo-MOF NBs) to serve as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The hollow architecture of ZnCo-MOF NBs can ensure fast charge transfer, improved sulfur utilization, and effective confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The atomically dispersed Co-O4 sites in ZnCo-MOF NBs can firmly capture LiPSs and electrocatalytically accelerate their conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple structural advantages, the ZnCo-MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and superior cycling stability for 300 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Framework&#8208;Hotspot Enhanced Trans Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Clinical Samples Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trans&#8208;cleavage property of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR&#8208;Cas system still require pre&#8208;amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework&#8208;Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100 fM) and rapid (&lt;15 min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Chitin&#8208; and Streptavidin&#8208;Mediated Affinity Purification Systems: A Screening Platform for Enzyme Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Affinity purification of recombinant proteins is an essential technique in biotechnology. However, current affinity purification methods are very cost intensive, and this imposes limits on versatile use of affinity purification for obtaining purified proteins for a variety of applications. To overcome this problem, we developed a new affinity purification system which we call CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification) for low&#8208;cost purification of Strep&#8208;tag II fusion proteins. The CSAP system is designed to utilize commercially available chitin powder as a chromatography matrix, thereby significantly improving the cost&#8208;efficiency of protein affinity purification. We investigated the CSAP system for protein screening in 96&#8208;well format as a demonstration. Through the screening of 96 types of purified hemoproteins, several proteins capable of the catalytic diastereo&#8208;divergent synthesis of cyclopropanes were identified as candidates for an abiotic carbene transfer reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Drug Release for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug delivery systems (DDSs) are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to specific target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Recent developments in drug&#8208;loaded DDSs have demonstrated promising characteristics and paved new pathways for cancer treatment. Light, a prevalent external stimulus, is widely utilized to trigger drug release. However, conventional light sources primarily concentrate on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light regions, which suffer from limited biological tissue penetration. This limitation hinders applications for deep&#8208;tissue tumor drug release. Given their deep tissue penetration and well&#8208;established application technology, X&#8208;rays have recently received attention for the pursuit of controlled drug release. With precise spatiotemporal and dosage controllability, X&#8208;rays stand as an ideal stimulus for achieving controlled drug release in deep&#8208;tissue cancer therapy. This article explores the recent advancements in using X&#8208;rays for stimulus&#8208;triggered drug release in DDSs and delves into their action mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Biomass Battery for Electricity Storage/generation and Concurrent Valuable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a rechargeable battery that can produce valuable chemicals in both electricity storage and generation processes hold great promise for increasing the electron economy and economic value. However, this battery has yet to be explored. Herein, we report a biomass flow battery that generates electricity while producing furoic acid, and store electricity while yielding furfuryl alcohol. The battery is composed of a rhodium&#8208;copper (Rh1Cu) single&#8208;atom alloy as anode, a cobalt&#8208;doped nickel hydroxide (Co0.2Ni0.8(OH)2) as cathode, and furfural&#8208;containing anolyte. In a full battery evaluation, this battery displays an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.29 V and a peak power density up to 107 mW cm&#8211;2, surpassing most catalysis&#8208;battery hybrid systems. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that this battery produces 1 kg furoic acid with 0.78 kWh electricity output, and yields 0.62 kg furfuryl alcohol when 1 kWh electricity is stored. This work may shed light on the design of rechargeable battery with value&#8208;added functionality such as chemicals production.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum/Copper Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition Reactions for the Synthesis of Functionalized Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of multicomponent ligands to improve catalytic reactivity and selectivity remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of chiral building blocks. Here, a modular synthesis of structurally diverse multiligated platinum complexes, characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, was revealed to open up a previously inaccessible reaction space. A library of more than 16 binary component&#8208;ligated platinum complexes was identified as a practical toolkit to enable faster screening. The isolated bench&#8208;stable Pt(II)(oxazoline)(phosphine) complex paired with a chiral copper complex exhibits fundamentally new cooperative reactivity. The newly designed Pt/Cu dual catalytic system contributed to the development of highly enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions between a Pt&#8208;activated electrophilic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbene and a Cu&#8208;activated nucleophile, resulting in a reliable process for the asymmetric synthesis of valuable functionalized indoles in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocarbon Oxidation by a Porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Cation Radical Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme and chlorin &#960;&#8208;cation radical oxidants are widely implicated in biological and synthetic oxidation catalysis. Little insight into the role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals in proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation is available. We prepared a NiII&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation complex ([NiII(P&#8226;+)]) and found it to be capable of the oxidation of a variety of simple hydrocarbon substrates. Interestingly, some of the products were hydroxylated, with ([NiII(P&#8226;+)]) working in concert with atmospheric O2 to yield hydroxylated hydrocarbons. Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical species oxidised substrates via a concerted PCET mechanism, where the nickel porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non&#8208;innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.</dc:description>

Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin-&#960;-cation radical species oxidised substrates via a concerted PCET mechanism, where the nickel porphyrin-&#960;-cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;-cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non-innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization and Fluorogenic Labeling of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific introduction of bioorthogonal handles into RNAs is in high demand for decorating RNAs with fluorophores, affinity labels or other modifications. Aldehydes represent attractive functional groups for post&#8208;synthetic bioconjugation reactions. Here, we report a ribozyme&#8208;based method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;functionalized RNA by directly converting a purine nucleobase. Using the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 as an alkyltransferase, the reaction is initiated by site&#8208;specific N1 benzylation of purine, followed by nucleophilic ring opening and spontaneous hydrolysis under mild conditions to yield a 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;formylimidazole residue in good yields. The modified nucleotide is accessible to aldehyde&#8208;reactive probes, as demonstrated by the conjugation of biotin or fluorescent dyes to short synthetic RNAs and full&#8208;length tRNA transcripts. Upon fluorogenic condensation with a 2,3,3&#8208;trimethylindole moiety, a novel hemicyanine chromo&#173;phore was generated directly on the RNA. This work expands the MTR1 ribozyme&#8217;s area of application from a methyltransferase to a tool for site&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage functionalization of RNA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The possibility for Au(III) &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes to undergo ring&#8208;opening and give &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes was interrogated. The transformation was first evidenced within (P,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, it occurs within hours at &#8211;50&#176;C. It was then generalized to other ancillary ligands. With (N,C)&#8208;cyclometalated complexes, the rearrangement occurs at room temperature while it proceeds already at &#8211;80&#176;C with a dicationic (P,N)&#8208;chelated complex. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the mechanism of the transformation, a disrotatory electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening. Intrinsic Bond Orbital (IBO) analysis along the reaction profile shows the cleavage of the distal &#963;(CC) bond to give a &#960;&#8208;bonded allyl moiety. Careful inspection of the structure and bonding of cationic &#963;&#8208;cyclopropyl complexes support the possible existence of C&#8211;C agostic interactions at Au(III).</dc:description>

         <title>Organopotassium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzylsilanes have found increasing applications in organic synthesis as bench&#8208;stable synthetic intermediates, yet are mostly produced by stoichiometric procedures. Catalytic alternatives based on the atom&#8208;economical silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds remain scarcely available as specialized directing groups and catalytic systems are needed to outcompete the kinetically&#8208;favored silylation of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds. Herein, we describe the first general and catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8211;N=N&#8211;SiR3) as silicon source. The high activity and selectivity of the catalytic system, exemplified by the preparation of various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes, originates from the facile generation of organopotassium reagents, including the tert&#8208;butylpotassium.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#181;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. Here, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#181;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(&#8722;)&#8208;Adenophorone (1), a caged polycyclic sesquiterpene featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[4.3.1.05,9]decane skeleton, was isolated from Eupatorium adenopharum Spreng. The structure of 1 was unambiguously established by a combination of spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and bioinspired total synthesis. Key synthetic features include a sequential Reformatsky/oxidation/regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydrogenation, and subsequent merged MBH&#8208;Tsuji&#8208;Trost cyclization. The concise synthetic sequence efficiently constructs the bicyclic skeleton of cadinene sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;euptox A (2) in 8 steps from commercially available monoterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;carvone (6), with outstanding performance on diastereocontrol. The bioinspired synthesis of 1 was achieved from 2, a plausible biogenetic precursor, via transannular Michael addition. This work provides experimental evidence of our proposed biosynthetic hypothesis of 1. Additionally, compound 1 showed potent neuroprotective activity in H2O2&#8208;treated SH&#8208;SY5Y and PC12 cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of high metal utilization in heterogeneous catalysis has triggered the burgeoning interest of various atomically dispersed catalysts. Our aim in this review is to assess key recent findings in the synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;property relationship and computational studies of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), which cover the full spectrum of applications in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In particular, combination of qualitative and quantitative characterization with cooperation with DFT insights, synergies and superiorities of DACs compare to counterparts, high&#8208;throughput catalyst exploration and screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms are highlighted. Undoubtably, it would be wise to expect more fascinating developments in the field of DACs as tunable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Functionalization with Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Disulfide Giving Symmetric and Unsymmetric Hydrazido Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we show that a tridentate bis(aryloxide)anilide&#8208;ligated titanium/potassium scaffold promotes functionalization of coordinated N2 with CO2 and CS2 through formation of N&#8211;C bonds. Treatment of a naphthalene complex with N2 gave an end&#8208;on bridging dinitrogen complex featuring a [Ti2K2N2] core. The dinitrogen complex underwent insertion of CO2 into each Ti&#8211;NN bond to afford an N,N&#8217;dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. Stepwise nitrogen&#8211;carbon bond formation at coordinated N2 proceeded to afford an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating the dinitrogen complex with CS2 and CO2. Addition of Me3SiCl to the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex resulted in partial silylation of the carboxylate groups but did not lead to removal of the functionalized N2 unit from the metal centers. However, reduction of the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex with potassium naphthalenide afforded an oxo&#8208;bridged dinuclear complex along with release of free potassium cyanate.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation of Type III to Type II Porous Liquids by Tuning Surface Rigidity of Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquids (PLs), a summation of porous hosts and bulky solvents bestowing permanent cavities, are the prominent emerging materials. Despite great efforts, exploration of porous hosts and bulky solvents is still needed to develop new PL systems. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with discrete molecular architectures can be considered as porous hosts; however, many of them are insoluble entities. Here we report the transformation of type III PL to type II PLs by tuning the surface rigidity of insoluble MOP, Rh24L24, in a bulky ionic liquid (IL). Functionalization of N&#8208;donor molecules on Rh&#8208;Rh axial sites ensue their solubilization in bulky IL which confer type II PLs. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal the bulkiness of IL as per the cage apertures, and the cause of their dissolution as well. The obtained PLs, capturing more CO2 than neat solvent, have depicted higher catalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition compared to individual MOPs and IL.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Redox Molecular Junctions in Covalent Organic Frameworks for H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass&#8208;valorization can not only maximize the energy utilization but also realize the production of value&#8208;added products. Here, a series of COFs (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF and TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with regulated redox molecular junctions have been prepared to study the H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with furfuryl alcohol (FFA) photo&#8208;oxidation to furoic acid (FA). Best of them, the FA generation&#8208;efficiency of Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can be 575 mM g&#8208;1 (conv. ~100% and sele. &gt;99%) and meanwhile the H2O2 production&#8208;rate can reach up to 187,000 &#956;M g&#8208;1, much higher than Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF, TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF and its monomers. As proved by theoretical calculations, the covalent coupling of Cu cluster and thiazole group can promote the charge&#8208;transfer, substrate&#8208;activation and FFA&#8208;dehydrogenation, thus boosting the both kinetics of H2O2 production and FFA photo&#8208;oxidation to increase the efficiency. This is the first work about COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass&#8208;valorization, which might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline&#8208;catalysts in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) Imaging of Individual Vesicles to Investigate the Relation between Fraction of Chemical Release and Vesicle Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging were used to measure vesicle size and vesicular isotopic dopamine content in cellular vesicles. Measurements before and after stimulated exocytotic release show the fraction of chemical release is independent of vesicle size.







Abstract
We used correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging to quantify the contents of subvesicular compartments, and to measure the partial release fraction of 13C&#8208;dopamine in cellular nanovesicles as a function of size. Three modes of exocytosis comprise full release, kiss&#8208;and&#8208;run, and partial release. The latter has been subject to scientific debate, despite a growing amount of supporting literature. We tailored culturing procedures to alter vesicle size and definitively show no size correlation with the fraction of partial release. In NanoSIMS images, vesicle content was indicated by the presence of isotopic dopamine, while vesicles which underwent partial release were identified by the presence of an 127I&#8208;labelled drug, to which they were exposed during exocytosis allowing entry into the open vesicle prior to its closing again. Demonstration of similar partial release fractions indicates that this mode of exocytosis is predominant across a wide range of vesicle sizes.

         <title>Merging Boron and Carbonyl based MR&#8208;TADF Emitter Designs to Achieve High Performance Pure Blue OLEDs
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DOBDiKTa merges the motifs of boron&#8208;based and ketone&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Using this molecular design, this compound shows deep blue, narrowband emission. The co&#8208;host device with DOBDiKTa achieved a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;% and blue emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12).







Abstract
Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds are attractive as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) as they can simultaneously harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light in the device and show very narrow emission spectra, which translates to excellent color purity. Here, we report the first example of an MR&#8208;TADF emitter (DOBDiKTa) that fuses together fragments from the two major classes of MR&#8208;TADF compounds, those containing boron (DOBNA) and those containing carbonyl groups (DiKTa) as acceptor fragments in the MR&#8208;TADF skeleton. The resulting molecular design, this compound shows desirable narrowband pure blue emission and efficient TADF character. The co&#8208;host OLED with DOBDiKTa as the emitter showed a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;%, an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 32&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12). Compared to DOBNA and DiKTa, DOBDiKTa shows higher device efficiency with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off while maintaining a high color purity, which demonstrates the promise of the proposed molecular design.

         <title>Free Amino Group Transfer via &#945;&#8208;Amination of Native Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino group transfer strategy was developed to install free NH2 to the &#945;&#8208;position of native carbonyls under mild conditions. The resulting primary &#945;&#8208;aminated products are amenable to in situ peptide coupling or Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization in one&#8208;pot procedures. We anticipate this method to provide a general platform towards the synthesis of amines, ultimately opening exciting avenues in the synthesis and medicinal study of peptidomimetics.







Abstract
We report herein a straightforward transfer of a free amino group (NH2) from a commercially available nitrogen source to unfunctionalized, native carbonyls (amides and ketones) resulting in direct &#945;&#8208;amination. Primary &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls are readily produced under mild conditions, further enabling diverse in situ functionalization reactions&#8212;including peptide coupling and Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization&#8212;that capitalize on the presence of the unprotected primary amine.

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanorings: Synthesis, Properties and Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Ternary Complexes Featuring a Narcissistic Chiral Self&#8208;Recognition for Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral carbon nanorings with excellent photophysical and chiroptical properties have been synthesized. Importantly, Chiral ternary complexes, consisted of chiral carbon nanorings, 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and protonated chiral amines, display excellent narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognitions for protonated chiral amines.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and chiroptical properties of novel chiral carbon nanorings Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP containing a planar chiral [2.2]PCP unit, and demonstrate that Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP can not only host crown ether 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring complexes with a binding constant 3.35&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, but also accommodate the complexes of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and S/R&#8208;protonated amines to form homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; and heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ternary complexes, displaying significantly larger binding constants of up to 3.31&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 depending on the chiral guests. Importantly, homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes exhibit an enhanced CD signal, while the heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ones have a constant CD signal compared with the chiral carbon nanorings, respectively, which suggests that homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes display a highly narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for S/R&#8208;protonated chiral amines, respectively. Finally, the chiral ternary complexes can be further applied to determine the ee values of chiral guests. The findings highlight a new application of carbon nanorings in supramolecular sensors, beyond the common recognition of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diarylmethylamines by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8208;H Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMAs) via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation was reported. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.

         <title>Guiding Principles for the Rational Design of Hybrid Materials: Use of DFT Methodology for Evaluating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in a Uranyl Tetrahalide Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl tetrahalide supramolecular systems are investigated using both experiment and Density Functional Theory. We intend to investigate the effect that hydrogen bonding may have on the formation enthalpies of these systems. Here, we demonstrate that an expanded network of hydrogen bonds can stabilize supramolecular complexes and directly affect their formation enthalpies.







Abstract
Together with the synthesis and experimental characterization of 14 hybrid materials containing [UO2X4]2&#8722; (X=Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;) and organic cations, we report on novel methods for determining correlation trends in their formation enthalpy (&#916;Hf) and observed vibrational signatures. &#916;Hf values were analyzed through isothermal acid calorimetry and a Density Functional Theory+Thermodynamics (DFT+T) approach with results showing good agreement between theory and experiment. Three factors (packing efficiency, cation protonation enthalpy, and hydrogen bonding energy [
]) were assessed as descriptors for trends in &#916;Hf. Results demonstrated a strong correlation between 
 and &#916;Hf, highlighting the importance of hydrogen bonding networks in determining the relative stability of solid&#8208;state hybrid materials. Lastly, we investigate how hydrogen bonding networks affect the vibrational characteristics of uranyl solid&#8208;state materials using experimental Raman and IR spectroscopy and theoretical bond orders and find that hydrogen bonding can red&#8208;shift U&#8801;O stretching modes. Overall, the tightly integrated experimental and theoretical studies presented here bridge the trends in macroscopic thermodynamic energies and spectroscopic features with molecular&#8208;level details of the geometry and electronic structure. This modeling framework forms a basis for exploring 3D hydrogen bonding as a tunable design feature in the pursuit of supramolecular materials by rational design.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic NO Oxidation with Simultaneous Nitrate Storage Using A Flow Photoanode Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr)/nickel foam with abundant mesoporous pores can enable the progressive conversion of NO into nitrate without releasing remarkable NO2 by refining the reactive oxygen species to &#8901;OH and achieve the simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants through a flow photoanode reactor. This study can provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for NO removal and sustainable nitrate storage.







Abstract
The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low&#8208;toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study demonstrates that this bottleneck can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS) on Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr) (Ni@NU) using nickel foam (NF) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas&#8208;phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8901;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82&#8201;% of NO without releasing remarkable NO2 under a low bias voltage (0.3&#8197;V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99&#8201;% for long&#8208;term use. Through calculation, 90&#8201;% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NOx control.

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer vesicles deform their shape gradually as every breath they take. SO2 gas reacting with the cyanine species in polymersomes can drive a continuous 1D stretching motion of membranes that transform them to tubesomes. Such a membrane plastic deformation process can be programmed by SO2 level, which will well regulate the membrane permselectivity to realize transmembrane traffic management towards cargos of different size.







Abstract
Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.

         <title>Influence of the Time Scale on the Reaction Mechanism of CO Oxidation over a Au/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) cell for rapid concentration modulation and applied it to study the reaction pathway of CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 at different time scales. We found that the reaction time could influence the reaction pathway. Multiple reaction mechanisms can be present under the same reaction conditions. At long reaction times, electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) play an important role.







Abstract
Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc., whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds, CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds, the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.

         <title>The Formation of NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+, Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles was followed using in situ X&#8208;ray scattering. The experiments reveal the kinetics of particle growth (small&#8208;angle scattering) and phase transformation (wide&#8208;angle scattering). A surprising particle size evolution is observed, where &#945;&#8208;phase particles develop a bimodal size distribution before they transform into &#946;&#8208;phase.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core&#8208;multi&#8208;shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles using in situ small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ex situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a unimodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to unimodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part before the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles, potentially due to inter&#8208;particle differences in stoichiometry. Rate equation modeling confirms that a continuous distribution of reactivities can result in the observed particle growth dynamics.

         <title>When Weak Is Strong: A Plea for Low&#8208;Affinity Binders for Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein labeling is a cornerstone of fluorescence microscopy. This is achieved using covalent or high&#8208;affinity target labels, which leads to a loss in fluorescence signal with time. Here, we highlight the new avenue of using reversible fluorophore labels, which exhibit a low binding affinity to their target and constantly &#8220;renew&#8221; the fluorescence signal. This enables novel biophysical applications across imaging platforms.







Abstract
The exploitation of low&#8208;affinity molecular interactions in protein labeling is an emerging topic in optical microscopy. Such non&#8208;covalent and low&#8208;affinity interactions can be realized with various concepts from chemistry and for different molecule classes, and lead to a constant renewal of fluorescence signals at target sites. Further benefits are a versatile use across microscopy methods, in 3D, live and many&#8208;target applications. In recent years, several classes of low&#8208;affinity labels were developed and a variety of powerful applications demonstrated. Still, this research field is underdeveloped, while the potential is huge.

         <title>Switchable Fluorescent Light&#8208;Up Aptamers Based on Riboswitch Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of switchable fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers is created by adopting a conformational switching principle derived from natural riboswitches. The aptamers can be activated or deactivated with RNA triggers or small molecules like guanine and adenine, providing highly sensitive switches with minimal signal leakage.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) such as Spinach or Mango can bind small fluorogens and activate their fluorescence. Here, we adopt a switching mechanism otherwise found in riboswitches and use it to engineer switchable FLAPs that can be activated or repressed by trigger oligonucleotides or small metabolites. The fluorophore binding pocket of the FLAPs comprises guanine (G) quadruplexes, whose critical nucleotides can be sequestered by corresponding anti&#8208;FLAP sequences, leading to an inactive conformation and thus preventing association with the fluorophore. We modified the FLAPs with designed toehold hairpins that carry either an anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence within the loop region. The addition of an input RNA molecule triggers a toehold&#8208;mediated strand invasion process that refolds the FLAP into an active or inactive configuration. Several of our designs display close&#8208;to&#8208;zero leak signals and correspondingly high ON/OFF fluorescence ratios. We also modified purine aptamers to sequester a partial anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence to control the formation of the fluorogen&#8208;binding conformation, resulting in FLAPs whose fluorescence is activated or deactivated in the presence of guanine or adenine. We demonstrate that switching modules can be easily combined to generate FLAPs whose fluorescence depends on several inputs with different types of input logic.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the slow water dissociation process limits the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In their Research Article (e202300873), Emiliano Cort&#233;s et&#8197;al. designed an atomically asymmetric local electric field using Ir&#8208;Ru dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to optimize the dissociation process by tuning the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation. As a result, IrRu DSACs exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10 mA/cm2&#160;current density in a single cell and a high stability over 300&#8197;h at 1 A/cm2&#160;in a membrane electrode assembly.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Driven Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a concept for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate that is driven by substoichiometric amounts of electrons, introduced electrochemically. This protocol enables access to a variety of nitro&#8208;derived molecules from unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, in addition to promoting ipso&#8208;nitration reactions and nitrative cyclizations with high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. The mechanism of the reaction is supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this reaction has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy to scale for decagram quantities, and exhibit exceptional substrate generality and functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Modulation of Uptake and Reactivity of Nitrogen Dioxide in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of NO2 is modulated in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3, which leads to reaction between NO2 and framework Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A higher NO2 dynamic uptake (6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) is achieved, compared with the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305 (2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 in which unbound N&#8208;centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter&#8208;balanced by Cl&#8722; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO2 into MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 leads to reaction between NO2 and Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K is observed for MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 as measured using a flow of 500&#8197;ppm NO2 in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO2 molecules within MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 and MFM&#8208;305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high&#8208;field solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV/Vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.

         <title>Bispalladium(II) Complexes of di&#8208;p&#8208;Pyrirubyrin Derivatives as Promising Near&#8208;Infrared Photoacoustic Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the synthesis and mutually reversible, fully controlled transformations of bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrins. The regioselective conversion of di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin into dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin leads to the incorporation of an unprecedented &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocycle skeleton. Significantly, all reported compounds have outstanding spectroscopic properties, including a photoacoustic response in the near&#8208;infrared I&#8211;II range.







Abstract
The insertion of palladium(II) into di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin results in mutually convertible bimetallic complexes. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of one of them yielded bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin and, after demetallation, dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin, introducing for the first time the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocyclic frame. Bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 6, bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 9, and dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 10 absorb and emit light around 1000&#8197;nm and are characterized by high photostability. Thus, they are promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic dyes, ideally targeting (9) the wavelength of Yb&#8208;based fiber lasers. The incorporation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moiety into expanded porphyrins opens a highly interesting area of research due to the attractive optical and coordination properties of the resulting molecules.

         <title>Charting the Chemical Reaction Space around a Multicomponent Combination: Controlled Access to a Diverse Set of Biologically Relevant Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charting the reaction space around a known Multicomponent Reaction (MCR) allows the development of new processes. In this way, a detailed study of the parameters involved in the Orru transformation leads to the generation of alternative connectivities featuring diversely substituted imidazolones, including GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) chromophores, coelenterazine derivatives, natural products, kinase inhibitors, and bioprobes.







Abstract
Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C&#8208;2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N&#8208;derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C-2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N-derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Postsynthetic Photochemical Modification and 2D Structuring of Zr&#8208;MOF Thin Films Containing Benzophenone Linker Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, porous and highly oriented films of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with benzophenone linker molecules were prepared as a new platform for photochemical postsynthetic modification. Potential reactivities range from targeted functionalization of the inner and outer surface, through grafting&#8208;from polymerization to true 2D patterning of defined structures.







Abstract
For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation MOF&#8208;based devices the availability of highly adaptable materials in suitable shapes is crucial. Here, we present thin films of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) containing photoreactive benzophenone units. Crystalline, oriented and porous films of the zirconium&#8208;based bzpdc&#8208;MOF (bzpdc=benzophenone&#8208;4&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) are prepared by direct growth on silicon or glass substrates. Via a subsequent photochemical modification of the Zr&#8208;bzpdc&#8208;MOF films, various properties can be tuned postsynthetically by covalent attachment of modifying agents. Apart from the modification with small molecules, also grafting&#8208;from polymerization reactions are possible. In a further extension, 2D structuring and photo&#8208;writing of defined structures is also possible, for example by using a photolithographic approach, paving the way towards micro&#8208;patterned MOF surfaces.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8211;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8211;glass composite membrane prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler produces a monolithic structure that eliminates non&#8208;selective grain boundaries, resulting in a preferential ultrahigh C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569 GPU and C2H6/C2H4 paraffin/olefin selectivity of 7.16.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8211;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569&#8197;gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding can play a significant role in designing complex bioinspired structures. Here, two different types of this interaction were employed to construct single and double helices from planar benzotellurazole amides.







Abstract
As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.
