         <title>Chiral Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles Scavenging Reactive Oxygen Species for Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gut microbiota dysbiosis are crucial factors that exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To address this, we successfully synthesized zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS NPs) with a particle size of approximately 500 nm and a maximum g&#8208;factor of 0.07, utilizing l&#8208;/d&#8208;cysteine as chiral ligands. In vitro experiments revealed that these chiral ZnS NPs could enter macrophages through the CD44 and clathrin pathways, which enhanced the ability to scavenge ROS, in turn significantly inhibited the NF&#8208;&#954;B and NLRP3 signaling pathways, thereby reducing the secretion of TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;6, and IL&#8208;1&#946;, while upregulating IL&#8208;10. In vivo experimental data showed that l&#8208;ZnS NPs outperformed 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, significantly improving body weight, reducing the IBD activity index, and attenuating tissue damage, concurrently, l&#8208;ZnS NPs exhibited a marked prophylactic effect. The benchmark studies verified that l&#8208;ZnS NPs increased the abundance of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 by 10.55&#8208;fold and decreased harmful Enterobacter by 2914.00&#8208;fold, thereby reshaping the intestinal microecological balance. Pharmacokinetic and biosafety assessments confirmed the safety of l&#8208;ZnS NPs. Our findings indicate that chiral ZnS NPs hold great potential as nanodrugs for the treatment and prevention of IBD, providing an important foundation for the development of IBD therapeutic strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Inside the Catalyst Layer on Gas Diffusion Electrodes in Electrochemical Reduction of CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are widely used in electrochemical CO and CO2 reduction reactions (CO(2)RR) in flow cells due to their ability to alleviate mass transport limitations of gaseous reactants. The flow cell configuration makes uniform distribution of reactants, intermediates, products, and speciation within the catalyst layer (CL) unlikely. In this work, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind in situ characterization technique capable of probing the cross section of the CL with confocal Raman spectroscopy was developed to investigate the speciation distribution across the Cu CL in CO(2)RR with a spatial resolution of ~4 &#956;m. In both CORR in alkaline medium and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte, the active region of CL was identified as that with the presence of the Raman band for adsorbed CO (COad). The strong correlation of COad and CO32&#8208; bands provides the first spectroscopic evidence that CO2RR only occurs in an alkaline microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Z&#8208;selective Styrene Synthesis via Dual Cobalt and Photocatalysis through Coupling of Unactivated Alkyl Iodides with Terminal Arylalkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient Z&#8208;selective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive hydroalkylation of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides has been achieved, providing a straightforward and modular route to access 1,2&#8208;disubstituted Z&#8208;styrenes. This reaction operates under mild conditions without requiring over&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of metal terminal reductants. Excellent Z/E ratios and good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds with remarkable functional&#8208;group compatibility. One potential utility of this reaction is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of several syn homoallylic alcohols in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step sequence. Control experiments strongly support that the halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) process is the key to generating carbon radicals. DFT studies suggest that the catalytic system involves Co(II)/Co(III) cycle and the steric repulsion between the Co(II) catalyst and the alkenyl radical in radical capture by Co(II) is the dominant factor controlling the Z/E selectivity. This approach represents the first example of merging photo&#8208;XAT with cobalt&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of terminal aryl alkynes with unactivated alkyl iodides.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Anthraquinones via J&#8208;Type Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence materials based on cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;chiral luminophores are highly desirable; however, their performance is often hindered by weak exciton&#8208;chirality coupling between the luminophore and its adjacent stereocenters. Here we introduce J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization as an effective strategy to address this challenge. By attaching amide groups to point&#8208;chiral anthraquinone luminophores, the formation of directional hydrogen bonds facilitates efficient chirality transfer from peripheral stereocenters to anthraquinones, resulting in supramolecular polymers with amplified chiroptical asymmetry. More importantly, the incorporation of acetylene spacers reduces torsional angle of the anthraquinone core compared to the non&#8208;acetylene control compound (1.81&#8304; vs. 33.4&#8304;), promoting J&#8208;aggregation and increasing emission intensity. This structural optimization enables the supramolecular polymers to achieve a circularly polarized luminescence brightness of 13.8 M&#8315;&#185;cm&#8315;&#185;, marking a significant advancement in point&#8208;chiral luminophore systems. Furthermore, the integration of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into these supramolecular polymers allows for the fabrication of color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized electroluminescent devices. Overall, J&#8208;type supramolecular polymerization represents a promising approach for developing high&#8208;performance chiroptical materials by simultaneously optimizing emission dissymmetry and quantum efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Biocatalysis to Generate Hydrogen Sulfide and Promote Endogenous Antioxidant Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Promoting cellular protective responses during oxidative stress conditions through the generation of antioxidant persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we report a bioinspired glycoconjugate, a candidate for tandem biocatalysis and generates persulfide/ H2S in response to oxidative stress. The glycoconjugate is cleaved by &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, an enzyme that is expressed during oxidative stress; the product of this reaction is a substrate for 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme that is involved in persulfide/ H2S biosynthesis. The catalytic systems are orthogonal to one another, and the glycoconjugate is efficiently cleaved by these enzymes to generate the potent antioxidant glutathione persulfide as well as H2S. We demonstrate the efficacy of this conjugate in mitigating inflammation in the brain in an animal model. Together, using rationally designed substrates and fully catalytic steps, we leverage tandem biocatalysis to direct the generation of persulfide/ H2S, and promote cells&#8217; own antioxidant response.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond Based Efficient Solid&#8208;State Organic Emitters Enabled by a Synergistic Anion and Mechanical Bond Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional fluorophores often face aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), limiting their efficacy in high&#8208;concentration applications. We demonstrate that a combined effect of anion and mechanical bond can significantly increase fluorescence intensity, up to 14&#8208;fold and a quantum yield of 97.0%. A large number of crystal analysis reveal that this enhancement is primarily driven by non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonds, which stabilizes the structure and restricts molecular motion. The versatility of this synergistic effect opens new avenues for applications, including circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) facilitated by chiral anions, and the development of a novel fluorescence switchable rotaxane shuttle that operates without charge transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Development for Sodium&#8208;Based Batteries: A Blueprint from Lithium or a Step Towards Originality?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, electrolyte design for sodium&#8208;based batteries is largely inherited from their lithium&#8208;based counterparts, which often present critical challenges that hinder forging new perspectives and thus further improvements. This work delves into the key properties of representative sodium and lithium&#8208;based electrolytes, encompassing prevailing salt anions. It aims to evaluate the impact of cation chemistry, including their nature and the degree of interactions with counter anions, thereby bridging the gap in effectively transferring the know&#8208;how accumulated in lithium batteries to sodium&#8208;based batteries. The results demonstrate that the unique impact of salt anions on the properties of metal&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is tightly correlated with the nature of metal cations. By synchronizing the anionic structures with the critical feature of sodium cations, the solvating dynamics and transport properties, chemical stability, aluminum corrosion behavior, and other key properties of the electrolytes could be finely tuned to fit the specific requirements of advanced sodium&#8208;based batteries. This work gives an in&#8208;depth insight into the chemical and physical features of sodium&#8208;based electrolytes, with a potential avenue to accelerate the deployment of high&#8208;performance sodium batteries and simultaneously inspire and guide the design of other electrolytes for emerging mono&#8208; and multi&#8208;valent cations&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Ruthenium(II) Complex Induces DNA Condensation in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the conventional ways to eradicate tumor cells is to utilize chemotherapy agents, e.g., cisplatin, to induce DNA damage. However, DNA damage repair mechanisms can significantly limit the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. These mechanisms enable tumor cells to repair the DNA damage caused by the drug, leading to resistance. Cisplatin and similar drugs bind to specific DNA sites without significantly altering their conformation. As a result, DNA repair enzymes can still attach to and repair the damaged DNA. To address this issue, we designed four Ru(II) complexes (RuC3, RuC6, RuC9, and RuC12) with high positive charges of +8 valence and regulated their nuclear accumulation levels by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. RuC9 exhibits the highest nucleus accumulation level. DNA conformation was significantly altered by inducing DNA condensation through indiscriminately neutralizing the negative charge of the DNA backbone. This significant change prevents DNA&#8208;related enzymes from binding to DNA, ultimately leading to the efficient eradication of various tumor cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that kills tumor cells and overcomes cisplatin resistance through inducing DNA condensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Borate Esterification for Evolved Supramolecular Chirality and Chiral Optics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topological chemical reactions in confined environments offer unique opportunities for constructing dynamically tunable crystalline materials and architecturally defined polymers. However, their potential within functional supramolecular systems and chiral materials remains largely untapped. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a borate esterification reaction to achieve dynamic modulation of supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties under aggregation conditions. Pyrene&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives, following functionalization with phenylboronic acid groups, co&#8208;assemble with catechol&#8208;functionalized pyrene derivatives. This co&#8208;assembly undergoes spontaneous and highly efficient borate esterification under ambient conditions, inducing nanoscale morphological evolution and an inversion of supramolecular chirality. Both experimental results and DFT&#8208;based computations reveal that the supramolecular chirality inversion is primarily driven by a transition from &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking to CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between pyrene moieties. This co&#8208;assembly&#8208;borate esterification process represents a powerful integration of non&#8208;covalent assembly and covalent chemistry, providing a versatile platform for the design of soft materials and chiral functional systems. Moreover, the introduction of alizarin derivatives containing catechol motifs enables the transfer of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), resulting in tunable emission shifts from blue and cyan to red. This work broadens the functional scope of chiral luminescent materials and opens new avenues for their application.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Glycolysis by Endogenous 31P CEST Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach to investigate glycolysis by&#160; &#179;&#185;P CEST applied to&#160; substrates at their endogenous concentration. The method relies on the assessment of the Saturation Transfer (ST) observed on the &#179;&#185;P signals of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or phosphocreatine (PCr) following the selective irradiation of phosphate groups of endogenous molecules exchanging with ATP, Pi, and indirectly with PCr in enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The concentrations of these substrates&#160; fall below the threshold for direct detection. &#179;&#185;P CEST technique amplifies their responses, making them detectable via the ST effect to the &#179;&#185;P resonance of the selected reference signal. The method was validated in vitro on mouse breast adenocarcinoma cell pellets (TS/A), where the intracellular Pi signal was monitored to assess the ST effect associated with the saturation of phosphoester&#8208;containing molecules. The use of a glycolysis inhibitor and different experimental temperatures (37&#176;C or 4&#176;C) provided insights supporting the rationale behind the method. A comparison of &#179;&#185;P Z&#8208;spectra was carried out on murine breast cancer cell lines with different degrees of aggressiveness, showing the ability to assess metabolic differences. Finally, in vivo experiments on mice models of mammary adenocarcinoma demonstrated that &#179;&#185;P CEST can differentiate tumor and healthy tissue based on their metabolic characteristics.</dc:description>

To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control, the new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism.

         <title>Achieving Buried Interface/Bulk Synergistic Passivation via Chlorophyll Derivative for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the ultra&#8208;high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, a portion of the chlorophyll derivative molecules that would be passivating nickel oxide diffuse into the perovskite with the perovskite precursor, thus achieving a buried interface/bulk synergistic passivation of perovskite films.








Abstract
Buried interfacial engineering is crucial for NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while most passivation measures focus only on the interface and neglect the perovskite bulk. In this work, a stable free&#8208;base chlorin possessing an amino acid terminal (serinyl pyropheophorbide&#8208;a, SPPa) was synthesized as a functional chlorophyll derivative, and its trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen chloride salts (SPPaX; X&#160;=&#160;TFA, HCl) were introduced into the NiOx/perovskite interface. Thanks to the high solubility in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, SPPaX can diffuse into the perovskite through the precursor. Insertion of SPPaX optimizes the interfacial energy band bending and minimizes interfacial defects, while the growth sites provided by SPPaX facilitate the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite film with less lattice strain and high crystal orientation. Additionally, diffused SPPaX molecules in perovskite improve the crystallization process and decrease the internal defects of perovskite films. As a result, the SPPaX distributed throughout perovskite achieves a bulk/interface synergistic passivation effect at both the bulk and buried interface of the perovskite film. SPPaTFA&#8208;modified PSCs deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.54% with a superior long&#8208;term stability under both light and thermal stress.

&lt;p&gt;Benefiting from the ultra-high solubility in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, a portion of the chlorophyll derivative molecules that would be passivating nickel oxide diffuse into the perovskite with the perovskite precursor, thus achieving a buried interface/bulk synergistic passivation of perovskite films.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buried interfacial engineering is crucial for NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while most passivation measures focus only on the interface and neglect the perovskite bulk. In this work, a stable free-base chlorin possessing an amino acid terminal (serinyl pyropheophorbide-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, SPPa) was synthesized as a functional chlorophyll derivative, and its trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen chloride salts (SPPaX; X&#160;=&#160;TFA, HCl) were introduced into the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface. Thanks to the high solubility in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, SPPaX can diffuse into the perovskite through the precursor. Insertion of SPPaX optimizes the interfacial energy band bending and minimizes interfacial defects, while the growth sites provided by SPPaX facilitate the formation of high-quality perovskite film with less lattice strain and high crystal orientation. Additionally, diffused SPPaX molecules in perovskite improve the crystallization process and decrease the internal defects of perovskite films. As a result, the SPPaX distributed throughout perovskite achieves a bulk/interface synergistic passivation effect at both the bulk and buried interface of the perovskite film.

         <title>Weak Attractive Noncovalent Interactions in Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of utilizing weak attractive noncovalent interactions, including only CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N interactions, has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the activity and/or enantioselectivity of metal catalysts in asymmetric hydrogenations, particularly for low&#8208;activity Earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts. Among these interactions, the weakest CH&#8943;HC interactions, when present in multiple instances, have been shown to exert a significant synergistic effect. This review summarizes recent progress in this field and provides a brief outlook on its future development.








Abstract
Weak attractive noncovalent interactions, specifically CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N contacts, between catalysts and substrates have recently gained renewed attention in asymmetric hydrogenations, despite their historical underappreciation due to challenges in detection. Emerging evidence underscores the significant role of these interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity, particularly in sustainable catalytic systems that utilize Earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. This minireview summarizes advancements in asymmetric hydrogenations catalyzed by both noble and Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes under an H&#8322; atmosphere, with a focus on the roles of CH/&#960;&#8943;HC/&#960; and CH&#8943;O/N noncovalent interactions in improving reactivity and/or enantioselectivity. Taking into account the weak attractive character of these noncovalent interactions, it is expected to help the design of novel chiral transition metal catalysts and develop more efficient asymmetric hydrogenation systems for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse chiral compounds.

         <title>An Activatable Caged Palladium Nanocomposite for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduced a multi&#8208;functional composite consisting of Pd nanoparticles, encapsulated in molecular cages, co&#8208;loaded with glucose oxidase and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;hyaluronic acid conjugate, acting as an effective activatable carrier for cancer therapy. It exhibits bioorthogonal catalytic and multi&#8208;enzyme mimicking activities, which can be selectively activated in the tumor and enable spatially targeted intracellular catalysis for therapy.








Abstract
Pd&#8208;based intracellular catalysis has attracted increasing interest in modulating biological processes or disease treatment. The unsatisfactory catalytic efficiency arising from limited active sites and poor water solubility of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and their &#8220;always on&#8221; catalytic activities pose, however, significant limitations. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;performance nanocomposite based on ultrafine Pd NPs confined within molecular cages, and incorporated with glucose oxidase (GOx) and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA). The cage&#8208;confined strategy enables facile synthesis of ultrafine Pd NPs with more accessible active sites, significantly improving the catalytic activities of Pd NPs for enhanced bioorthogonal catalysis. Importantly, the nanocomposite exhibits targeting ability and activatable activity in response to both the acidic pH and hyaluronidase overexpressed in the tumor environment, enabling selective drug synthesis. Besides, it features CAT&#8208;, OXD&#8208;, and GPx&#8208;like activities, promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and intracellular GSH depletion to elevate oxidative stress for enhanced therapy. The cage&#8208;confined configuration makes it possible to establish metal&#8208;based intracellular catalytic systems with high performance, enabling the synthesis of desired molecules for effective disease theranostics.

         <title>Cascaded Metalation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Electrochemical CO Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded metalation in a 2D covalent organic framework (COF) shifts the overall d&#8208;band center upwards and enhances CO adsorption. The secondary metal sites facilitate the hydrogenation of CO. Consequently, the barriers associated with the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) are significantly lower, leading to substantial improvements in the CO reduction reaction with a 23&#8208;fold enhancement in the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of methanol production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) to high&#8208;value methanol requires the delicate design of catalysts due to the large overpotential. Especially, achieving precise modification of electrocatalysts while preserving the periodic alignment of active sites to optimize performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the cascaded metalation of phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs for selective reduction of CO to methanol. After implanting the secondary metal (Ni), CityU&#8208;35 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.4% at &#8722;0.85&#160;V versus RHE, significantly surpassing that of CityU&#8208;34 (2.1%) with only Co atoms. Enhanced methanol production originates from the optimization of electronic structure with improved *CO adsorption, as substantiated by the in situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the cascaded metalation with the introduction of secondary Ni sites not only strengthens *CO adsorption but also accelerates proton generation for the hydrogenation of *CO toward CH3OH. The cascaded metalation with synergistic effects between Co and Ni sites reduces the energy barriers and improves the overall electroactivity. Our results demonstrate cascaded metalation as an effective strategy to tailor the catalytic activities of 2D&#160;COFs, extending the functional design of reticular frameworks in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Engineered by Catalysis Chemistry Toward Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis chemistry strategy was applied to construct a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing the sodium dendrites growth and enhancing the reversibility of sodium plating/stripping toward advanced anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are considered one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density.

&lt;p&gt;A catalysis chemistry strategy was applied to construct a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for suppressing the sodium dendrites growth and enhancing the reversibility of sodium plating/stripping toward advanced anode-free sodium metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anode-free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are considered one of the most promising large-scale energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density. Nonetheless, their practical application is hindered by the uncontrolled growth of sodium dendrites. Constructing a mechanically robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite formation. Herein, we report a catalysis chemistry approach to construct an ultra-thin (&#8764; 5&#160;nm), NaF-rich and high-strength (203&#160;MPa) SEI layer by introducing Ru catalytic sites on the current collector, which promotes rapid Na&#8314; diffusion and effectively inhibits dendrite growth. Benefiting from this design, the Ru modified-Cu//Na asymmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability over 2000&#160;h (1000 cycles at 2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the AFSMBs with Ru modified-Cu current collector also deliver excellent cycling performance and maintains nearly 98.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The results demonstrate great potential of catalysis chemistry in developing advanced sodium metal anodes and provide a new perspective to engineering efficient SEI toward battery applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aminomethyl Phosphonic Acid as Highly Effective Multifunctional Additive for Modification of Electron Transport Layer and Perovskite in Photovoltaic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The passivation of detrimental perovskite&#8208;based defects is critically acknowledged for fabricating highly effective perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The presence of a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL) is also considered a pivotal factor for effective charge extraction and transport dynamics. Herein, a simple small organic molecule, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the SnO2 ETL. The defects in the SnO2 ETL are effectively suppressed by passivating the oxygen vacancies upon the SnO2 surface. Simultaneously, the carrier mobility and crystallinity of SnO2 are enhanced, and the upward&#8208;regulated conduction band minimum (CBM) is beneficial for constructing a favourable energy level alignment with the perovskite layer. Notably, the introduced residuals on the SnO2 surface can function as crystalline seeds for growth of large perovskite grains, which can passivate the defects in the perovskite bulk phase, boundaries, as well as the SnO2/perovskite interface. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the AMPA&#8208;modified PSCs is enhanced from 19.91% to 24.22%. Most importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs with AMPA maintained 94.9% of the initial PCE during 720 h of storage at a relative humidity of 10%, attributed to the improved hydrophobicity of both the SnO2 and perovskite layers after AMPA modification.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Within the family of halide solid electrolytes (SEs), Li2ZrCl6 demonstrates high oxidative stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and mechanical deformability, positioning it as a promising candidate for SEs. However, the application of Li2ZrCl6 as a SEs was hindered by its low ionic conductivity at room temperature. Current strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6 primarily are focused on single cation or anion sublattice&#8208;engineering, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Here, we propose a novel cation and anion&#8208;sublattice&#8208;engineering strategy, termed CASE, to increase the amorphous content and thus enhance ionic conductivity. The incorporation of Cu2+ and O2&#8208; induces distinctive structural modifications within Li2ZrCl6. This structure corroborated through analytic data of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the neutron diffraction, and ab initio molecular dynamics. Consequently, the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 achieves an enhanced ionic conductivity of 2.05 mS cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries utilizing the amorphous Li2.1Zr0.95Cu0.05Cl4.4O0.8 as an electrolyte and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 as a cathode exhibit a superior long&#8208;term cycling stability retaining 90.3% of capacity after 1000 cycles at 2 C under room temperature, which are much higher than those of Zr&#8208;based halide electrolytes in publications. Such a result might stimulate the development of more amorphous structures with high ionic conductivity in the CASE strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photoconversion of a Discrete Mixed Iodine(I) System to a 1D Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a mixed halogen(I) complex (2), containing three distinct iodine(I) moieties ([N&#8213;I&#8213;N]+, O&#8213;I&#8213;N, and [O&#8213;I&#8213;O]&#8208;) within the same structure was synthesised with 4&#8208;styrylpyridine (4&#8208;stypy) and 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorophthalate as the stabilising Lewis bases. This complex was observed to be in equilibrium with its respective bis(OIN) complex (1a), with isolated samples of 2 also being found to convert to 1a in solution. Upon UV irradiation of 2, a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2+2] cycloaddition reaction was observed, converting the discrete salt 2 to the 1D polymer 5. Complex 5 retained all the iodine(I) moieties from prior to photoconversion, and represents the first example of non&#8208;destructive photoconversion of a halogen(I) complex. To facilitate comparisons to 2 and 5, several additional closely&#8208;related iodine(I) complexes were synthesised, with the iodine(I) complexes characterised by NMR (1H, 1H&#8208;15N HMBC) and SCXRD, as well as by Raman and IR spectroscopy for 2, 5, and their close structural analogue 1a.</dc:description>

         <title>Microporous Hard Carbon Support Provokes Exceptional Performance of Single Atom Electrocatalysts for Advanced Air Cathodes</title>

         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts embracing metal&#8208;nitrogen (MNx) moieties show promising performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The modification on spatially confined microenvironments, which won copious attention with respect to achieving efficient catalysts, are auspicious but yet to be inspected for MNx moieties from modulating the energetics and kinetics of ORR. Here, Fe single atoms (SAs) are immobilized in microporous hard carbon (Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC), in which the microporous structure with crumpled graphene sheets serves confined microenvironment for catalysis. Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC holds a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.927&#160;V and excellent stability for ORR. Theoretical studies unveil that hydrogen bonding between the intermediate of O* and micropore interior surfaces substantially promotes its protonation and accelerates overall ORR kinetics. Both the aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries driven by Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC air cathode show excellent stability with small charging/discharging voltage gaps. Importantly, when used as the air cathode for industrial chlor&#8208;alkali process, the applied voltage of Fe&#8208;SAs/MPC&#8208;based flow cell to reach 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is 1.57&#160;V, which is 210&#160;mV smaller than Pt/C&#8208;based one. These findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into the confined microenvironment of MNx moieties for boosted electrochemical performance, and pave the pathways for future catalyst development satisfying the requirement of industrial applications.</dc:description>

BO&#8208;N exhibited UV emission in toluene solution and 1,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene (mCP) film, with photoluminescence (PL) peaks of 391 and 400 nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 15 and 34 nm, respectively. The device doped with 5 wt% BO&#8208;N achieved a narrowband UV emission with an FWHM of 37 nm, an electroluminescence peak (&#955;EL) of 399 nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.166, 0.030). Moreover, the device attained a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 18.6% among reported HLCT&#8208;based UV OLEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.05.

         <title>Bright and Versatile Azetidinecarboxamide&#8208;Based Fluorophore&#8208;Ligand Conjugates for High&#8208;Resolution Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophore&#8208;ligand conjugates play a pivotal role in cellular imaging, providing high target specificity. However, simultaneously achieving conjugates with high brightness and ligand&#8208;targeting diversity presents significant challenges. Traditional strategies often require complex, multi&#8208;step modifications for fluorophore enhancement and ligand conjugation. Here, we present an azetidinecarboxamide strategy that addresses these challenges by integrating brightness enhancement and ligand conjugation capabilities within a single molecular framework. The azetidinecarboxamide core suppresses twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), thereby enhancing fluorescence quantum yield. Its carbonyl group provides a versatile site for conjugating a wide range of targeting ligands, enabling the rapid development of diverse and tunable fluorophore&#8208;ligand conjugates. This streamlined approach reduces synthetic complexity, accelerates probe development, and is compatible with a wide variety of fluorophores, such as coumarin, naphthalimide, NBD, rhodol, rhodamine, and silicon&#8208;rhodamine, facilitating the creation of high&#8208;performance, multifunctional probes for advanced cellular imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible CO2 Hydrogenation, Neutron Crystallography, and Hydride Reactivity of a Triiridium Heptahydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triiridium heptahydride cluster catalyzes reversible CO2 hydrogenation. Foundational structural and reactivity studies that combine neutron crystallography and spectroscopy, electrochemistry, synthetic studies, and kinetics uncover previously elusive metal&#8211;metal cooperative reactivity that enables a unique approach to functionalizing CO2.








Abstract
The authors report the structure, reactivity, and catalytic utility of a triiridium complex, [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;H)(PN)3]2+ (2&#8208;H, PN = (2&#8208;pyridyl)CH2PBut2). Despite its unusual stability to unsaturated organics, electrophiles, and even CF3SO3D, they find that complex 2&#8208;H catalyzes hydrogenation of CO2 to formate (TONIr&#160;=&#160;9600) and reverse formic acid dehydrogenation (TONIr&#160;=&#160;54&#160;400). The hydrogenation operates via a reactive intermediate [Ir3H4(&#956;&#8208;H)4(PN)3]+ (5). Neutron crystallography and DFT&#8208;supported neutron vibrational spectroscopy of 2&#8208;H reveal Ir&#9472;H bond lengths and elucidate the vibration modes within the Ir3H7 core. Stoichiometric oxidation of 2&#8208;H produces four classes of iridium complexes of varied nuclearity and hydride structure: tetra&#8208; and pentanuclear clusters [Ir3H6(&#956;3&#8208;AuPPh3)(PN)3]2+ (2&#8208;Au) and [Ag{Ir2H4(&#956;&#8208;OAc)(PN)2}2]3+ (6) are generated using AuPPh3+ and AgOAc, respectively. Further oxidation to class [Ir2H3(&#956;&#8208;X)2(PN)2]+ is possible with AgOAc, Hg(OAc)2, or I2. Finally, a TEMPO/HCl system completely oxidizes the hydrides and gives [Ir2Cl4(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(PN)2] (11).

         <dc:description>
An improved stereoselective and regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization enables the formation of completely alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), as reported by Guangqiang Xu, Qinggang Wang et al. in their Communcation (e202417075). This breakthrough PLGA exhibits a record&#8208;high melting temperature (143.1&#176;C), forms a stereocomplex (211.8&#176;C) and demonstrates linear hydrolytic degradation with controlled drug release behavior, positioning it as an ideal carrier for long&#8208;acting therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Intermediates Adsorption on Amorphous NiFe Alloys for Highly Active and Selective Electrochemical Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple doping strategy is developed to engineer reactive intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloy catalysts. Mn&#8208;doping into amorphous NiFe alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to generate active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA.







Abstract
Electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) offers a promising route to transform biomass into value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) greatly limits the HMFOR selectivity. Herein, we report a facile doping strategy to engineer oxygen intermediates adsorption on amorphous NiFe alloys to boost highly selective electrochemical HMF oxidation to produce 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), among which, amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy displays a low HMFOR onset potential of 1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE, achieving 100&#8201;% HMF conversion with 88&#8201;% FDCA selectivity at an applied potential of 1.4&#8197;V vs. RHE, outperforming amorphous NiFeB (73&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) and Mo&#8208;doped NiFeB (65&#8201;% FDCA selectivity) alloys. Experimental characterizations suggest that the introduction of Mn/Mo into amorphous NiFeB alloy can increase/decrease its electronic density and thus strengthen/weaken oxygen intermediates adsorption. Operando experiments indicate that the amorphous Mn&#8208;doped NiFeB alloy can significantly reduce the onset potential to form active Ni3+ species, which spontaneously react with HMF via nucleophile dehydrogenation to form FDCA. Furthermore, in situ infrared spectroscopy measurements verify that the HMF oxidation pathway follows the 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) route rather than the 2,5&#8208;diformyfuran (DFF) route.

         <title>Profiling Allosteric Modulators of CB1R with an Allosteric Fluoroprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#8208;based assay to directly profile CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) independently of orthosteric radioligands. Our fluorescent tracer allows for distinction between allosteric and orthosteric ligands and reliable determination of CB1R AM binding affinities. (TOC Figure created in BioRender. Ganzoni, R. (2024) https://BioRender.com/g15u623.)







Abstract
Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB1R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET&#8208;based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB1R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB1R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB1R with comparable affinity (pKi=5.34 and 5.67, respectively).

&lt;p&gt;We report the first cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer-based assay to directly profile CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R allosteric modulators (AMs) independently of orthosteric radioligands. Our fluorescent tracer allows for distinction between allosteric and orthosteric ligands and reliable determination of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R AM binding affinities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allosteric modulation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) offers a promising alternative to conventional therapeutic approaches using orthosteric ligands (OLs). Currently, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R allosteric modulators (AMs) are characterized based on their ability to modulate binding or functional response of OLs, preventing isolation of individual contributions by allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Herein, we develop the first allosteric fluoroprobe and attendant FRET-based assay allowing for the direct profiling of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R AMs without coincubation with an OL. Our allosteric tracer enables differentiation of allosteric and orthosteric ligands as well as their pharmacological profiling at CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R. The utility of this work is highlighted by addressing ambiguities surrounding the binding of cannabidiol (CBD). CBD was found to interact with both allosteric and orthosteric sites of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R with comparable affinity (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Optimized Reconstruction of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Introduces Cation Vacancies for Selective Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathway represents a green production process that has gained increasing importance. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of efficacious catalysts to attain high activity under industrial current density. In this study, we present a strategy for cation vacancy generation through metal&#8208;organic frameworks self&#8208;optimized reconfiguration for the efficient electrosynthesis of H2O2 under industrial current densities in solid&#8208;electrolyte cell.&#160; The ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo electrocatalyst exhibits significant H2O2 selectivity of 97.8%, and the H2O2 productivity is up to 24.53 mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a direct and continuous output of ~3.36 wt% H2O2 aqueous solutions under industrial current density (400 mA cm&#8722;2). Impressively, the ZIF&#8208;ZC91@Co(OH)2&#8208;VCo possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 220 h and can output H2O2 aqueous solution with a concentration of ~8.03 wt% in the pilot experiment. Theoretical calculations confirm that the introduction of modest cation vacancies optimizes the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate and reduces both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers, thus balancing the selectivity of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction. This work provides valuable insights into the rapid, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of H2O2 and the rational design of highly active catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of a DNA&#8208;Stabilized Ag16Cl2 Nanocluster in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis are used to determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag nanocluster.








Abstract
We determine the first solution&#8208;state structure of a DNA&#8208;stabilized Ag16Cl2 nanocluster using X&#8209;ray total scattering and pair distribution function analysis. We find that the structure in solution exhibits both displacive and rotational distortions compared to the known crystal structure. Additionally, our measurements are sensitive toward changes in DNA conformation, revealing that the DNA scaffold in solution exhibits significantly more flexibility than when conformationally locked in the crystalline form. Our results demonstrate the capability to determine the structure of DNA&#8208;stabilized clusters beyond their crystallized form, an essential step toward understanding differences between their solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state photophysical properties.

         <title>Why Mental Health Literacy Can Improve STEM</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite its widely appreciated significance, most research on mental health is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. This contribution intends to enhance discussion between those disciplines and the STEM field by pointing toward relevant studies, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of articles have outlined the mental health crisis in academia. Despite its widely appreciated significance, most of the related research is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. Despite stakeholders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) being disproportionately affected, they are often left in the dark about important findings unless they seek out relevant information themselves. This contribution attempts to spark interdisciplinary discussion between psychology, psychiatry, and STEM by highlighting relevant research, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ Hybrid Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods of assembling low&#8208;symmetry heterometallic cage architectures are limited to stepwise construction and combinations of inert and labile metal ions, affording complex, anisotropic cage structures by sacrificing synthetic ease. Herein, a heterometallic [Cu2PdL4]2+ lantern&#8208;type cage has been assembled in a single self&#8208;assembly step through the use of a heteroditopic ligand with two different metal&#8208;binding groups. The resultant cage complex is a fusion of two common lantern&#8208;type cage motifs &#8211; carboxylate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic Cu4L4 cages and pyridyl&#8208;based Pd2L4 coordination cages. Evidence for heterometallic cage formation in solution was provided by 1H and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) data, while circular dichroism (CD) spectra confirmed the helical nature of the assembly. The heterometallic cage was then exploited in binding heterotopic guests. It is envisioned that the simple design strategy presented herein will ease the assembly of other structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry cage architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Strategy Yields Dopant&#8208;Free Small Molecule Hole Transport Materials for Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.58% Efficiency and Outstanding Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic perovskites are known for their excellent photothermal stability; however, the photothermal stability of all&#8208;inorganic n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is compromised due to ion diffusion and free radical&#8208;induced degradation caused by the use of doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport materials (HTMs). In this study, two isomeric D&#8208;A&#8208;D type small molecules, namely HBT and HiBT, were developed and used as dopant&#8208;free HTMs, using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole or benzo[d][1,2,3]thiadiazole as acceptor moieties. The HiBT molecule, with its symmetry&#8208;breaking features, exhibits a large dipole moment, enhanced coordination&#8208;active sites, and a well&#8208;aligned energy level structure, all of which contribute to passivating perovskite surface defects and improving free charge separation. As a result, inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs with HiBT HTM achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.58%, the highest reported for dopant&#8208;free HTM&#8208;based inorganic PSCs. Moreover, the enhanced hydrophobic properties of HiBT molecules, coupled with their ability to passivate perovskite surface defects, contribute to significantly improved device stability.</dc:description>

Herein, we introduce mannosylated compartmentalized cross&#8208;linked enzyme&#8208;driven nanomotors (c&#8208;CLEnM), which exhibit specific and efficient targeting of Hep G2 cells through elevated autonomous motion. In this design, we constructed biodegradable bowl&#8208;shaped stomatocytes encapsulating the enzymes glucose oxidase and catalase within their nanocavity. A subsequent enzyme crosslinking reaction was performed to guarantee their stability. Furthermore, the c&#8208;CLEnM were surface modified with a mannose&#8208;functional glycopolymer, enabling binding with receptors expressed on Hep G2 cells. Interestingly, the targeting ligands on the nanomotors not only improved their specificity towards cancer cells but also enhanced motility. Compared to the non&#8208;mannosylated nanomotors, mannosylated c&#8208;CLEnM exhibited enhanced motion and higher targeting efficiency to cells in glucose&#8208;containing ionic environments. The unexpected acceleration in speed resulted from the surface modification of these nanomotors with a glycopolymer layer, which increased the zeta potential and created a shielding effect that mitigated the influence of the surrounding ions. This nanomotor design highlights the synergistic effect of functional glycopolymer&#8208;modification on cellular uptake, adding an additional level of control to nanomotors for application in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Peptide Nanotubes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;conjugated peptides are attractive building blocks for the construction of new nanomaterials. However, the ability to control the self&#8208;assembly of these materials remains a major limitation to their wider utilization. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fine&#8208;tune the assembly of water&#8208;soluble hydrophilic polymer&#8208;conjugated cyclic peptides by incorporating a defined, short hydrocarbon linker between the polymer and peptide. This addition creates a well&#8208;defined hydrophobic &#8216;inner shell&#8217; that suppresses water from disrupting the organized peptide hydrogen bond network. Our approach is demonstrated using a series of cyclic peptide&#8208;linker&#8208;PDMA conjugates which were evaluated by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation, small angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations were also used to show how the polymer and the peptide stacks interact and illustrate the impact of this hydrophobic inner shell approach. This strategy provides a modular approach to fine control the nanotube self&#8208;assembling behavior. We expect that this technique will improve the versatility of peptide nanotubes for the engineering of advanced nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Robust Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Highly Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries show great promise for energy storage, but are plagued by poor cycling stability, which can be attributed to unfavorable electrode/electrolyte interphases for both anode and cathode. Here we design and achieve the anion&#8208;moderate solvation structure based interconnected clusters in electrolyte by regulating the interactions of solvent with Li+ and diluent to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases simultaneously for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;SPAN batteries. The optimal electrolyte endows Li plating/stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% at 1 mA cm&#8211;2 in Li||Cu cells. The Li&#8211;SPAN batteries show excellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 94.21% after 1215 cycles. Moreover, the assembled pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;SPAN battery under limited electrolyte condition (2.40 g Ah&#8211;1) achieves a capacity of 3.75 Ah, corresponding to a high energy density of 180 Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the total mass of the battery. This work provides a good electrolyte design principle to construct robust anode/electrolyte and cathode/electrolyte interphases for batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing molecular recognition for small molecule&#8208;mediated, reversible photochemical control over mRNA translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical probes that control the function of complex RNA molecules offer unique opportunities to interrogate biological systems. In this study, we demonstrate that a small molecule ligand selectively recognizes and undergoes traceless, reversible photocrosslinking to PreQ1 RNA aptamers. This effect is selective and dependent on both the chemical structure and RNA sequence/structure. A homogeneously modified, caged mRNA construct containing a PreQ1 aptamer and an eGFP or wild type p53 coding sequence displayed repressed translation in vitro or in cells until irradiated with 302 nm light, resulting in cleavage of the photocage and restoration of translation. This method demonstrates for the first time that aptamer&#8208;based molecular recognition of a small molecule ligand can be used to precisely and photochemically activate the translation of a complex mRNA in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Chromophores of Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert low&#8208;concentration CO2 into the value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is particularly interesting yet remains highly challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized three metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) through the Schiff&#8208;base condensation reactions between trinuclear copper complex and different BDP&#8208;based chromophores (BDP = 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8208;. As a result, MCOF&#8208;ANT containing anthracene (ANT) group achieves the highest HCOO&#8208; production rate of 1658 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (HCOO&#8208; selectivity, ~100%) in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers under a laboratory light source, which is 7.2 and 2.1 times higher than those of MCOF&#8208;Ph and MCOF&#8208;Nap with phenyl (Ph) and naphthalene (Nap) groups, respectively. Furthermore, MCOF&#8208;ANT also exhibits an excellent photocatalytic activity for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (15%) to HCOO&#8208; under natural sunlight, with a HCOO&#8208; production rate of 1239 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (HCOO&#8208; selectivity, ~100%). Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of ANT in MCOF&#8208;ANT is favorable to the visible&#8208;light harvesting and charge separation, as well as the formation of *OCO intermediate, which clearly accounts for its superior catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Potassium Tetraiodatoiodate(III) Iodate(V): A Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Exceptional Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Full&#8208;Wavelength Phase Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical materials with large nonlinear optical susceptibilities, wide transmission ranges, and comprehensive full&#8208;wavelength phase matching capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel potassium tetraiodatoiodate(III) iodate(V) via an in situ reduction and complexation reaction. The resulting compound, K2[IIII(IVO3)4]IVO3, exhibits exceptional second harmonic generation responses (21.6KH2PO4 at 1064 nm, 1.0KTiOPO4 at 2050 nm), a wide transparency range from the visible to the mid&#8208;infrared wavelengths (0.37&#8211;6.05 &#956;m and 7.03&#8211;13.40&#160;&#956;m), and a high birefringence (0.358 at 543 nm) to achieve full&#8208;wavelength phase matching. These properties are primarily ascribed to the synergistic substantial hyperpolarizability and polarizability anisotropy exhibited by the [IIII(IVO3)4]&#8722; complex ions, which comprise square&#8208;planar coordinated trivalent iodine and optimally arranged iodate ligands. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of nonmetallic cation centered coordination entities in influencing linear and nonlinear optical properties, a discovery that has significant implications for the development of innovative inorganic functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the chirality of Metallo&#8208;cages by Manipulating the Stereochemistry of the Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control over the chirality of metallo&#8208;cages by maniplating the stereochemistry of metal centers is important in many practical applications, but is extremely challenging. In this study, two isostructural metallo&#8208;cuboctahedra (1&#8208;ZnII12L18 and 2&#8208;CdII12L18) have been assembled using ligand L1 and two kinds of metal ions (ZnII and CdII) with similar coordination lability.

         <title>Removing &#945;&#8208;H in Carboxylate&#8208;based Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although carboxylate esters greatly improve the cold weather performance of graphite&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilized in arctic expeditions, the underlying cause of the incompatibility between carboxylates and lithium (Li) anodes has not been sufficiently explained, resulting in the greatly restricted usage of carboxylate in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we reveal the serious parasitic reactions between carboxylate &#945;&#8208;H atoms and Li metal are the culprits that render carboxylate&#8208;based ineffectiveness for LMBs. By replacing all &#945;&#8208;H atoms with fluorine atoms and methyl groups, we successfully construct inert carboxylates and find the ions/molecules distribution in electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) can be manipulated at a molecular&#8208;level. The unique structure ensuring more anions are positioned closer to the Li surface in the EDL of the inert carboxylate&#8208;based electrolyte, the morphology of the deposited Li is significantly regulated and the chemical corrosion gets effectively inhibited. As a consequence of remarkable extending lifespan of carboxylate&#8208;based LMBs with routine salt concentration and few additives. More generally, using carboxylates lacking &#945;&#8208;H atoms offers a realistic approach to increase the variety of solvents that can be used in LMBs electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens Enable Optical Logic Gates toward Lighting, Scintillators and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pressure&#8208;induced emission luminogens (PIEgens) opened the door to highly emissive materials. However, the high&#8208;pressure phase with excellent optoelectrical properties is difficult to be stabilized at ambient conditions, seriously limiting the practical applications. Here, we firstly lighted up non&#8208;emissive zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halide (C25H22P)2SnCl6 via pressure engineering, ultimately yielding the bright emission. Note that the quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment of 20.0 GPa exhibited the very bright blue&#8208;white emission. This irreversible photoluminescence (PL) transition was associated with the irreversible amorphization by increasing the potential barrier of phase transition through the steric hindrance effect. The increased distortion of inorganic octahedra and the enhanced hydrogen bond interaction within the amorphous (C25H22P)2SnCl6 after pressure treatment were responsible for the bright emission. Thus pressure&#8208;triggered PL turn&#8208;on behavior can serve as a robust optical switchable logic gate from the initially dark state &#8220;0&#8221; to the bright state &#8220;1&#8221;. Furthermore, the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 exhibited an unexpected excitation&#8208;dependent emission. The unique characteristic of &#8220;PIE&#8221; with different colors can be decoded the Morse code encrypted with the pressure&#8208;treated (C25H22P)2SnCl6 and different excitations. The quenched (C25H22P)2SnCl6&#8208;based phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs), X&#8208;ray dose rate detection and centimeter&#8208;level patterns highlighted great potentials in lighting, display, scintillators, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Atom Migration Dominates Anomalous Reversible Oxidation of Ru Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation is a ubiquitous reaction in nature. For most metals (especially metal nanoparticles), they will be completely oxidized under suitable conditions, except ruthenium (Ru). In this work, in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy (in&#8208;situ TEM) and ex&#8208;situ spectroscopy were employed to investigate the oxidation process of Ru nanosheets. &#160;Ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic analysis demonstrates the incomplete oxidation of Ru nanosheets to RuO&#8322;, while the in&#8208;situ TEM observations uncover an anomalous reverse phase transformation from the oxidized to metallic phase during oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the oxygen atom migration dominates the reversible oxidation process, strikingly distinct from the unidirectional oxidation pathways in conventional metallic systems. The as&#8208;generated abundant Ru&#8208;RuO2 heterointerfaces formed through reversible oxidation provide a wealth of active sites for electrochemical alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the study not only lays a foundation for the understanding complex dynamic oxidation processes, but also offers new insights into for the design of nanocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The incorporation of fluorine and fluorinated functional groups into organic molecules alters their physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating the advancement of novel therapeutics, agricultural chemicals, biological probes, and materials. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency of methodologies for the catalytic synthesis of certain significant fluorine&#8208;containing groups, such as ArCF2&#8208;, under mild conditions utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals. Herein, we report a method for the regioselective hydroarylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under mild conditions with the aid of Ni&#8208;H intermediate catalysis, which is capable of efficiently synthesizing compounds containing the ArCF2&#8208; structural motifs and possesses good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Engineering of Multiple&#8208;Resonance Framework Targeting Efficient Organic Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as promising candidates for organic laser applications due to the potential for simultaneously achieving large oscillator strength and triplet utilization. In this study, we investigate the impact of peripheral tert&#8208;butyl (t&#8208;Bu)&#8208; and phenyl (Ph)&#8208;substituents on the typical 9&#8208;(phenylcarbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;3&#8208;carbonitrile (CzBN) MR framework. While these modifications preserve the frontier molecular orbital distribution with large oscillator strengths, they significantly influence excited&#8208;state dynamics and molecular aggregation at even low doping concentrations. Introducing Ph substituents extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugation extension of CzBN, promoting closer molecular packing, detrimental molecular aggregation, and significantly broadening the excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) band, which negatively impacts lasing performance. In contrast, CzBN&#8208;tBu, incorporating t&#8208;Bu groups as non&#8208;conjugated substituents, demonstrated reduced molecular aggregation and a distinct separation between the ESA band and stimulated emission region. Consequently, the optimal distributed feedback lasing performance is achieved by CzBN&#8208;tBu across various doping concentrations, resulting in the lowest lasing threshold of 3.4 &#181;J cm&#8722;2. These findings underscore the impact of inherent aggregation at low doping ratio on lasing activities, highlighting the crucial role of rational peripheral engineering in modulating molecular interactions and excited&#8208;state dynamics, offering design strategies for developing MR lasing molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have been extensively studied under room and ultralow temperature conditions. However, mechanism studies at intermediate temperature ranges remain limited. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical performance of an AZIB using a commonly employed 3 M ZnSO4 electrolyte across the intermediate temperature range of 25 to &#8208;15 &#176;C. Notably, we find that the battery with a double hydroxide cathode exhibits optimized performance at &#8208;5 &#176;C, demonstrating significantly enhanced cycling stability compared to 25 &#176;C. Mechanistic studies reveal that unfavorable H+&#8208;associated reactions at both the cathode and anode are effectively alleviated at &#8208;5 &#176;C, contributing to improved cycling stability. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses show that changes in the electrolyte environment at &#8208;5 &#176;C&#8212;such as reduced electrochemical activity of H2O, increased H&#8208;bond strength, and decreased total number of H bonds&#8212;impede H+ diffusion through the H&#8208;bond network via the Grotthuss mechanism. These effects collectively suppress harmful H+&#8208;associated reactions, allowing Zn2+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion to dominate the charge storage process. This work provides valuable insights into the enhanced performance of AZIBs at sub&#8208;low temperatures and presents opportunities for extending battery operation in near&#8208;freezing environments.</dc:description>

In this work, we investigate the electrochemical performance of an AZIB using a commonly employed 3 M ZnSO4 electrolyte across the intermediate temperature range of 25 to -15 &#176;C.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Self&#8208;Fenton&#160;Reaction Mediated by Silver Single Atom&#160;and Cluster&#160;Photocatalysts for Highly Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen toward Efficient Organic Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The persistent organic pollutants in wastewater have caused the heavy threat to ecosystems and humans, but selective removal of these pollutants still faces challenges due to low efficiency, extra addition of oxidation agents and many highly toxic intermediate products. Herein, we report an efficient fast kinetic conversion via a photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system of *OOH intermediate&#8208;involved oxidation pathway with high selection generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) from the novel in&#8208;situ H2O2 heterolytic activation route for the first time. The single&#8208;atom and cluster doped zinc oxide (AgSA&#8208;AgC/ZnO) was successfully synthesized to achieve the 100 % degradation yield and 80 % total of carbon (TOC) of the p&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP) as the typical pollutant under solar&#8208;light irradiation and exhibit long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for 4&#8208;CP degradation. It was attributed to the accelerated cycles from Aghigh&#948;+ site to Aglow&#948;+ site in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis achieving the rapid selection conversion from the H2O2 heterolytic cleavage to ~100 % 1O2 via the intermediate *OOH at the Ag SA sites for ring&#8208;opening reaction and reactive H* at the Ag clusters sites for dechlorination reaction, respectively. This discovery gives the deep understanding of the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction through in&#8208;situ cycles of variable metals for the organic contaminants treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorophores Nucleate and Stabilize Collagen Triple Helices &#8211; En Route to Better Diagnostic Tools for Fibrosis and Tissue Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are emerging as valuable diagnostic tools for fibrosis and tissue repair. We show that fluorophores markedly impact the folding behavior of CMPs and enhance the stability of the resulting collagen triple helices. Our results highlight that careful selection of the fluorophore is essential when designing CMPs for applications in biology and medicine.








Abstract
Fluorescently labeled collagen model peptides (CMPs) are useful tools for monitoring fibrotic processes and tissue repair. Fine&#8208;tuning the propensity of the CMP to form a collagen triple helix is crucial since only single&#8208;stranded but not triple&#8208;helical CMPs integrate efficiently into damaged or remodeling tissue. Yet the impact of fluorophores on the folding behavior of CMPs and triple helix stability has so far been underappreciated. Here, we show that N&#8208;terminal fluorophores enhance triple helix stability and nucleation. Thermal denaturation and temperature jump experiments showed that triple helix stability and nucleation are proportionally affected by the accessible surface area of the fluorophore. For biological applications, fluorophores with a small surface area are therefore beneficial. Furthermore, we show that fluorophores bearing ionizable groups with an appropriate pKa value, such as commonly used fluorescein, can be used to create pH&#8208;responsive assemblies. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate fluorophores and spacers when developing fluorescent probes for biological applications.

         <title>In Situ Light&#8208;driven pH Modulation for NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using light&#8208;activated photoacids. By combining light stimuli with pH&#8208;sensitive molecules, we demonstrate the ability to precisely modulate pH without physically manipulating the sample. This method enables noninvasive pH titration in NMR studies, where pH plays a key role in protein function. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control to overcome existing limitations in NMR, providing a powerful tool for advancing protein research under controlled pH conditions.








Abstract
Proton exchange is a fundamental chemical event, and NMR provides the most direct readout of protonation events with site&#8208;specific resolution. Conventional approaches require manual titration of sample pH to collect a series of NMR spectra at different pH values. This requires extensive sample handling and often results in significant sample loss, leading to reduced signal or the need to prepare additional samples. Here, we introduce a novel approach to control pH in NMR samples using water soluble photoacids, which alters the pH of the solution from near neutral to acidic pH upon in situ photo illumination. We show that the solution pH can be precisely controlled by choice of illumination wavelength and intensity, and sufficient protons are released from the photoacid to achieve meaningful pH change in samples where the molecule of interest has significant buffering capacity, such as a&#160;&gt;100&#160;&#181;M protein sample. The pH is monitored in situ using internal standards with pH&#8208;sensitive chemical shifts. This method enables precise, calibrated, and noninvasive change of sample pH within an NMR magnet, dramatically reducing the necessary sample handling. These findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;induced pH control in NMR experiments and increase the robustness and reliability of pH&#8208;dependent studies.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expansion of Furyl Hydrosilanes: Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Oxasilines as Diels&#8208;Alder Diene Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Ru&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion of readily available silylfurans has been achieved, allowing access to 1,2&#8208;oxasilines in excellent yields. Featuring cyclic dienes with a Si&#9472;O linker, 1,2&#8208;oxasilines display high reactivity in DA cycloaddition with a broad range of electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles. The Si&#9472;O linker could be reserved, transformed or extruded in the DA cycloadducts, enabling flexible assembly of diverse molecular skeletons with high complexity.








Abstract
The development of new methods for aromatic ring&#8208;expansion offers a strategic means of transforming abundant aromatic feedstocks into intricate structures via skeletal editing, thereby unlocking valuable avenues for organic synthesis. We report herein a mild and efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;expansion of 2&#8208;silylfurans to form 1,2&#8208;oxasilines with wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the reaction proceeds through regioselective insertion of furan double bond into a Ru&#9472;H bond, followed by skeletal rearrangement, 1,2&#8208;hydride transfer, and elimination steps. The resulting 1,2&#8208;oxasilines are electron&#8208;rich cyclic dienes with an extrudable and transformable Si&#9472;O linker, which exhibit unique and versatile reactivity in Diels&#8211;Alder cyclization with electron&#8208;deficient dienophiles, enabling modular assembly of molecular skeletons with higher complexity.

         <title>Isoselenourea&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Pyrazolo&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis Enabled by Self&#8208;Correcting Amide and Ester Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isoselenourea catalyzed route to fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridone and &#8208;pyranone heterocycles has been developed. Mechanistic and computational studies highlight the significance of an intermediate amide or ester product derived from 1,2&#8208;addition that can be diverted to the desired pathway through isoselenourea acylation.








Abstract
Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds, and as such, the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable.

     alt="Isoselenourea-Catalyzed Enantioselective Pyrazolo-Heterocycle Synthesis Enabled by Self-Correcting Amide and Ester Acylation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly enantioselective isoselenourea catalyzed route to fused pyrazolo-pyridone and -pyranone heterocycles has been developed. Mechanistic and computational studies highlight the significance of an intermediate amide or ester product derived from 1,2-addition that can be diverted to the desired pathway through isoselenourea acylation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds, and as such, the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable. This manuscript describes the effective formation of fused pyrazolo-pyridones and -pyranones in high enantioselectivity (up to &amp;gt;99:1 er) via an isoselenourea (HyperSe) catalyzed enantioselective [3&#160;+&#160;3]-Michael addition-cyclization process using readily available pyrazolylsulfonamides or pyrazolones as pronucleophiles and &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated anhydrides as starting materials. Mechanistic analysis indicates an unusual self-correcting reaction pathway involving preferential [1,2]-addition of the pronucleophile to initially generate an intermediate amide or ester that can be intercepted by isoselenourea acylation, leading to productive formation of the fused heterocyclic products with high enantiocontrol.

         <title>Spatially Controlled Co&#8208;Delivery of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Agents Using DNA Nanoframeworks for Pancreatic Cancer Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework is constructed via precipitation polymerization, achieving the spatially controlled codelivery of molecular beacon and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine.








Abstract
Theranostic platforms that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities offer promising strategies for precision medicine, particularly in the treatment of major diseases. However, the development of platforms capable of achieving spatially controlled detection and therapy at the lesion site remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA nanoframework that achieve spatially controlled codelivery of molecular beacon (MB) and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), enabling simultaneous specific optical detection and efficient gene therapy for pancreatic cancer. The DNA nanoframeworks are synthesized via precipitation polymerization, utilizing acrylamide&#8208;modified DNA to initiate a hybridization chain reaction that facilitates the effective loading of MB&#8208;extended and sgRNA&#8208;conjugated DNA hairpins. The Cas9 protein is efficiently loaded into the nanoframeworks through phase transition&#8208;induced polymer chain rearrangement, overcoming steric hindrance. Upon aptamer&#8208;mediated internalization into PANC&#8208;1 cells, the overexpressed apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 and ribonuclease H in cancer cells induce site&#8208;specific cleave of MB and DNA&#8211;RNA hybrid duplex, respectively. This cleavage restores fluorescence for specific optical detection, whereas the released Cas9 RNP performs gene editing for efficient therapy. Low fluorescence background and favorable biocompatibility are observed in normal cells. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, the platform demonstrates significant detection&#8208;guided antitumor efficacy, highlighting its potential for precision medicine in cancer therapy.

         <title>Radical Chemistry of Tetrazenes: Access to Polymers with Pristine Tetrazenyl Chain Ends and Depolymerization Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;Atom abstraction in the &#945; position of tetrazenes generates for the first time a C&#8208;centered radical capable of polymerization initiation while maintaining the integrity of the tetrazene moiety. Depending on the conditions selected, the resulting polymer 4N chain ends can lead to either re&#8208;initiation and chain extension, or unzipping depolymerization.








Abstract
We report the first radical reaction of tetrazenes&#8212; i.e., functions with four consecutive nitrogen atoms with a linear N&#8211;N&#9552;N&#8211;N chain&#8212;that retains the characteristic 4N pattern. Selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in the &#945;&#8208;position of the 4N chain enables the free radical polymerization of various polar and nonpolar monomers. The tetrazene units play a dual role. Its decomposition generates aminyl radicals that can undergo HAT with another tetrazene molecule and lead to initiating C&#8208;centered radicals. Contrary to what was previously thought the aminyl radicals never add to the monomers. The polymers obtained feature tetrazene chain ends, which can be harnessed as macro&#8208;initiators to further grow the polymer chains. Heating of the former above the ceiling temperature leads to cleavage of the tetrazene function, which enables depolymerization by unzipping of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS).

         <title>Size Effect of Surface Defects Dictates Reactivity for Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium&#8208;sized defects on VOx surfaces achieve an optimal synergy between electronic and geometric properties, enhancing N2 adsorption, activation, and hydrogenation while effectively suppressing HER. This results in remarkable eNRR activity and selectivity. A well&#8208;defined structure&#8211;activity relationship underscores the critical role of defect size in eNRR performance. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ammonia (NH3) production. Defect engineering enhances eNRR activity but can concurrently amplify the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), posing challenges for achieving high selectivity. Herein, VOx with systematically tuned defect sizes is engineered to establish a structure&#8211;activity relationship between defect size and eNRR performance. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that medium&#8208;sized defects (VOx&#8208;MD, 1&#8211;2 nm) provide an optimal electronic environment for enhanced N2 adsorption and activation while maintaining spatial flexibility to facilitate efficient hydrogenation. Consequently, VOx&#8208;MD exhibits outstanding eNRR performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 81.94&#160;&#177; 1.45&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 31.97&#160;&#177; 0.75&#160;% at &#8722;0.5 V (vs RHE). These findings highlight the critical role of defect size in governing eNRR activity, offering a scalable strategy for designing advanced catalysts for competitve electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Rapid and In Situ Active Sites Regeneration for OER Activity Recovery and Greatly Prolonged Water&#8208;Splitting Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high demand for catalyst stability originates from the difficulty in replacing catalysts in assembled electrolyzers. This work proposes an active site regeneration strategy to in situ recover the anodic catalytic activity within the electrolyzer to extend its operational life.








Abstract
Inspired by the continuous regeneration of enzymes in living organisms that enables sustained long&#8208;term enzymatic reactions, we propose an active site regeneration strategy to rapidly and in situ recover the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the electrode through switching anode solution, to substantially prolong the service life of the electrolytic cell. The OER activity of anodic NiFe(S)/NM catalyst synthesized by coating S&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;LDH on nickel mesh (NM) exhibited excellent initial activity, then experienced gradual active site and activity losses due to the nanosheet detachment from NM after a long&#8208;term OER process. Attractively, such a damaged catalyst and its active sites can be effectively regenerated by an in situ redox reaction followed by electrochemical oxidation through switching the anode into the different solutions, resulting in the full recovery of the OER activity to its initial value. The recovered catalyst (R&#8208;NiFe(S)/NM) retains 90% of the initial activity and can be operated stably for over 80&#160;h at 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 even after four cycles of being damaged and recovered, and the established electrolyzer equipped with in situ recovered catalyst can be operated at the identical current density and almost the same cell voltage to that of the initial one.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diphosphazenanes: Inorganic Cyclohexane&#8208;like Connectors with Stereochemically Tunable Exit Vectors for Molecular and Macromolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New aza&#8208;diphosphinanes have been prepared and a model has been developed to explain their cis/trans isomerization. Two&#8208;fold oxidation leads to new aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes as robust inorganic connectors with selectable stereochemistry. Polycondensation reactions results in the first inorganic cyclo&#8208;linear polyphosphazenes which have high&#8208;molecular weights and are air stable, solution processable materials.








Abstract
Molecules that place functional groups at well&#8208;defined angular and radial separations are valued as connectors in synthetic chemistry. Examples include rigid, polyvalent arenes and bicyclic compounds featuring strong C&#9472;C or C&#9472;H bonds. Aliphatic rings are rare in this context due to the challenge of stereochemical control over C&#9472;H functionalization. Here we investigate inorganic cyclohexane&#8208;like P2N4 rings (aza&#8208;diphosphinanes) and develop a model based on negative hyperconjugation and diaxial strain to explain their cis/trans isomerization. Informed by this model, we rationally make 1,4&#8208;disubstituted aza&#8208;diphosphinanes, and stereoselectively oxidize them to aza&#8208;diphosphazenanes, which retain their cis (77&#176;) or trans (180&#176;) covalent exit vectors. These compounds show high stability but nevertheless react as 1,4&#8208;dinucleophiles, supporting their classification as new cyclohexane&#8208;like connectors. Appropriate connector choice in polycondensations enables the divergent synthesis of low&#8208;molecular weight macrocyclic oligomers (from the cis variant) or the first example of high molecular weight cyclo&#8208;linear polyphosphazenes (from the trans variant). These results provide fundamental insight into the stereochemistry of inorganic heterocycles and molecular dimensionality, debut connectors that fill a niche left by organic ones, and offer access to new classes of inorganic polymers for future investigation.

A novel titanium phosphate, Ti2O3(H2PO4)2&#183;2H2O, is introduced as a metal&#8208;free anode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) with a remarkably low discharge potential of 0.17&#160;V (vs. Zn2+/Zn). The TOHPO&#8208;based full cell demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 94% of its capacity after an impressive 50,000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of metal&#8208;free anodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.








Abstract
The application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) with Zn metal anode is hindered by severe dendritic growth, corrosion, and inefficient Zn utilization. &#8220;Rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; type AZIBs are considered a viable approach toward practical applications due to the success of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries employing intercalated graphite anodes. Herein, a new type of layered titanium phosphate Ti2O3(H2PO4)2&#183;2H2O is proposed for the first time as the intercalated anodes for AZIBs, exhibiting a capacity of 108&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, with a low discharge potential of 0.17&#160;V (vs. Zn2+/Zn). The ion insertion process is thoroughly investigated, and a micro&#8208;dendrite growth&#8208;corrosion mode is proposed to explain the capacity degradation mechanism. Corresponding countermeasures are designed, resulting in a significant improvement in cycle life. When coupled with a zinc hexacyanoferrate (KZnHCF) cathode, the &#8220;rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; full battery exhibits an ultralong lifespan of 50000 cycles (111 days) at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 with 94% capacity retention. This work presents a novel perspective for the development of practical AZIBs.

         <title>Semiconductor Spacer with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure Drives 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells Beyond 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong orbital interactions were observed for RP perovskites based on newly developed semiconductor spacers, MeBThMA and CNBThMA. The unique D&#8208;A structure of CNBThMA spacer effectively eliminates the dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers, contributing to the formation of energy levels, and adjusting the anisotropic charge transport properties. As a result, the CNBThMA&#8208;Pb (n&#160;=&#160;5) device achieved a champion efficiency of 20.82%.








Abstract
Two dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites have emerged as promising photovoltaic materials. However, their further improvement in photovoltaic efficiency is hindered by the large dielectric mismatch and high exciton binding energy caused by the insulating spacers. Herein, two semiconductor spacers, namely MeBThMA and CNBThMA, were developed for 2D RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In contrast to MeBThMA, the CNBThMA spacer, which features a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, exhibits a larger dipole moment and adopts a face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking arrangement in the single crystal. The unique D&#8208;A structure effectively eliminates the dielectric mismatch between the organic and inorganic layers, contributing the formation of energy levels, adjusting the anisotropic charge transport properties, and improving the film quality of layered RP perovskites. Consequently, the devices based on CNBThMA (nominal n&#160;=&#160;5) achieved a champion efficiency of 20.82%, which is a record efficiency for 2D RP PSCs using semiconductor spacers to the best of our knowledge. Our work pioneers a novel way to design organic semiconductor spacers using a D&#8208;A structure for highly efficient 2D PSCs.

         <title>&#8220;Crystallinity Wave&#8221;&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;crystallinity wave&#8221; induced regional difference ripening strategy was developed to fabricate hollow multi&#8208;shell covalent organic framework particles (COF HoMSs). The as&#8208;prepared COF HoMSs exhibit significantly enhanced specific capacitance as a supercapacitor electrode material when using KI as the redox electrolyte.








Abstract
Hollow multi&#8208;shell covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with abundant modular interfaces, high loading capacity, and various microenvironments are expected to hold great potential for chemical separation, heterogeneous catalysis, and energy storage/conversion. However, the synthetic methodology of COF hollow multi&#8208;shell nanoarchitectures has not been established. Herein, we demonstrate an ingenious &#8220;crystallinity wave&#8221;&#8208;induced regional difference ripening strategy to synthesize a series of hollow multi&#8208;shell COF particles with controllable shell numbers and shell thickness. The methodology relies on the isolation effect of the local crystalline COF thin layer inserted between the two layers of amorphous covalent organic polymer by the short&#8208;time Ostwald ripening, so that different regions of the particles exhibit distinct reaction stages before reaching chemical equilibrium in the subsequent dynamic imine exchange reaction, and then regions that tend to hydrolyze dissolve during the complete ripening process to form a hollow multi&#8208;shell structure. Remarkably, this strategy can be extended to prepare other hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs by altering monomers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, the obtained hollow multi&#8208;shell COFs are used as the electrode materials for supercapacitor. Benefiting from the short mass transfer path of the hollow multi&#8208;shell structure, ordered channels of the COF, and their&#160;high surface area, the as&#8208;prepared particles exhibit remarkably enhanced specific capacitance.

         <title>Halogen Bonding as a Tool to Control Morphology and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces halogen bonding (XB) as an effective strategy for controlling morphology and enhancing charge transport in organic semiconductors. By incorporating directional XB donors with pyridine&#8208;functionalized naphthalene diimide derivatives, improved molecular packing, crystallinity, and electron mobility are achieved. These findings establish XB as a versatile tool for optimizing organic electronic materials. 








Abstract
The solid&#8208;state structure and morphology of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are critical in determining the performance of organic electronic devices, as they directly influence charge carrier mobility. Improved molecular packing and ordering are key to achieving better device performance. While halogen bonding (XB) has been extensively used in supramolecular crystal engineering, its potential for organic electronics remains largely untapped. Here, we show that strong and directional XB can significantly enhance the morphology and optoelectronic properties of a pyridine&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivative. By employing various XB donors with differing interaction strengths and comparing them to a nonbonding reference compound, we achieve a two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in field&#8208;effect mobility and ION&#8208;IOFF ratio. Furthermore, the geometric substitution pattern of the XB donors is found to strongly influence molecular packing, crystalline domain formation, and, ultimately, device performance.

     alt="Halogen Bonding as a Tool to Control Morphology and Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article introduces halogen bonding (XB) as an effective strategy for controlling morphology and enhancing charge transport in organic semiconductors. By incorporating directional XB donors with pyridine-functionalized naphthalene diimide derivatives, improved molecular packing, crystallinity, and electron mobility are achieved. These findings establish XB as a versatile tool for optimizing organic electronic materials. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solid-state structure and morphology of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are critical in determining the performance of organic electronic devices, as they directly influence charge carrier mobility. Improved molecular packing and ordering are key to achieving better device performance. While halogen bonding (XB) has been extensively used in supramolecular crystal engineering, its potential for organic electronics remains largely untapped. Here, we show that strong and directional XB can significantly enhance the morphology and optoelectronic properties of a pyridine-substituted naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivative. By employing various XB donors with differing interaction strengths and comparing them to a nonbonding reference compound, we achieve a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in field-effect mobility and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ON&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OFF&lt;/sub&gt; ratio. Furthermore, the geometric substitution pattern of the XB donors is found to strongly influence molecular packing, crystalline domain formation, and, ultimately, device performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off of RuO2 via Metallic Ru Bilateral Regulation for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuO2 electrocatalysts, which followed a kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism, perform a preferable intrinsic activity, but poor stability for acidic oxygen evolution. This work offer a strategy which introduce metallic Ru onto RuO2 to build the Ru4+&#9472;O&#9472;Ru0 interfacial structure for decreasing the Ru4+ oxidation state and promoting deprotonation kinetic, thus balancing the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution. 








Abstract
Developing highly efficient acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. RuO2 electrocatalysts, which followed a kinetically favorable lattice oxygen mechanism, perform a preferable intrinsic activity, but poor stability for acidic OER. Recent work often sacrifices the intrinsic activity of RuO2 to enhance stability. The balance between the activity and stability of RuO2&#8208;based catalysts is still overlooked in current research. Here, we report a controlled method to introduce metallic Ru onto RuO2 catalysts to form the Ru4+&#9472;O&#9472;Ru0 interfacial structure for decreasing the Ru4+ oxidation state and promoting deprotonation kinetics. Metallic Ru can serve as the electron donor to lower the oxidation state of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722; in Ru/RuO2 for stabilizing the structure of *Vo&#8208;RuO42&#8722;&#8208;Ru/RuO2 to favour the acidic OER stability. Moreover, the deprotonation kinetics via the interfacial oxygen site between Ru4+ and Ru0 is significantly enhanced on Ru/RuO2 catalysts to improve the acidic OER activity. This work offers a unique perspective to balance the acidic OER activity and stability of RuO2.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#9472;H Bond Functionalization of Sugars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nontypical sugars represent a prominent, yet hardly, accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. Here, we disclose a technology toward non&#8208;typical sugars that allows facile, and site&#8208;selective functionalization of native sugars. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant carbohydrates.








Abstract
Non&#8208;typical C&#8208;functionalized sugars represent a prominent yet hardly accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. The available synthetic methodologies toward such sugar derivatives suffer either from an extensive use of protecting groups, requiring long and laborious synthetic manipulations, or from limited predictability and noncontrollable site&#8208;selectivity of the employed C&#8208;functionalization reactions. In this work, we disclose an alternative synthetic methodology toward nontypical sugars that allows facile, site&#8208;selective, and stereocontrolled C&#8208;functionalization of sugars through a traceless tethering approach. The described silyl&#8208;based redox&#8208;active tethering group appends directly to the unprotected sugar substrate and mediates the C&#8208;functionalization reaction through a photochemically&#8208;promoted 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, while transforming into a readily&#8208;removable silyl protecting group. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrate substrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant C&#8208;functionalized carbohydrate conjugates.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed a type of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COF&#8208;based photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS to produce H2 and O2. Attributed to its higher water vapor harvesting ability, the Pt@DHTA&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF with two C&#9552;O groups in the aldehyde section showed a better visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS activity. Further characterizations indicate that the carbonyl&#8208;O and pyridine&#8208;N atoms in COF serve as water&#8208;absorbing sites, and the pyridine&#8208;N heteroatoms facilitate the OER process in photocatalytic reactions by reducing the Gibbs free energy barrier.








Abstract
Photocatalytic overall water vapor splitting (OWVS) into H2 and O2 not only owns the potential of avoiding the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction reforming H2O, but also realizes H2 production without available liquid water. However, this attempt is still a blank due to the weak absorption of photocatalysts to water vapor. Herein, we report the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven OWVS by combining the water&#8208;adsorbing ability and photocatalytic activity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The overall water splitting (OWS) activity of Tp&#8208;COF skeleton was realized by introducing tripyridyltriazine segment. The Pt@Tp&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF achieves high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates (HER and OER) of 148.4 and 74.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, respectively. Under water vapor conditions with diverse relative humidities (RHs), the Pt@Tp&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF could drive OWVS even without backward reaction. By further optimizing the structure of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine section, it was found that the Pt@DHTA&#8208;TAPyT&#8208;COF showed optimal OWVS activity, with the H2 and O2 evolution rate of 51.2 and 25.6&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under RH&#160;=&#160;88%, respectively. The advantage of OWVS compared to traditional solid&#8211;liquid OWS was further confirmed by a continuous activity test of 45&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations indicated that carbonyl&#8208;O and pyridine&#8208;N atoms in COFs serve as water&#8208;absorbing sites, and the absorbed water molecules could promote water&#8208;splitting activity of active sites in COFs simultaneously.

         <title>Low Strain Mediated Zn (0002) Plane Epitaxial Plating for Highly Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated anthracene triptycene photopolymerized on Zn plate exhibits nanocrystalline structure with highly ordered nanochannels (1.5 nm), which divides low&#8208;strain nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and enables sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane with low nucleation energy (0.2&#160;e&#8722;&#160;&#197;&#8722;3), low&#8208;grain strain (&#8722;0.2 to 0.4 MPa), and low&#8208;strain accumulation (3.7 MPa), enabling highly reversible and stable Zn anodes for advanced zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Optimizing the crystalline orientation to achieve stable Zn (0002) plane growth is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, the lattice strain of Zn substrate hinders stable Zn2+ plating/stripping and sustainable epitaxial growth of Zn (0002) texture. Herein, we present a low&#8208;strain strategy to mediate nucleated&#8208;Zn grains for stabilizing Zn2+ electrodeposition/stripping process and guiding sustainable Zn2+ growth along (0002) surfaces. Fluorinated anthracene triptycene polymer (FATP) photopolymerized on Zn exhibits nanocrystalline structure with highly ordered nanochannels (1.5&#160;nm), enabling oriented nucleation and sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane due to low nucleation energy (0.2 vs. 1.1&#160;e&#8722;&#160;&#197;&#8722;3 of pure Zn) and low grain strain (&#8722;0.2 to 0.4 vs. &#8722;0.9 to 0.9&#160;MPa). Besides, the ordered porous FATP nanofilm refines electroplating Zn grains (9.4 vs. 26.7&#160;&#181;m), alleviating strain accumulation (3.7 vs. 28.2&#160;MPa) and lattice distortion. Consequently, FATP&#8208;Zn||Cu cell achieves a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% over 6000 cycles, while FATP&#8208;Zn||FATP&#8208;Zn cell shows stable plating/stripping after 5000 h. Notably, FATP&#8208;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell (2.77 Ah) demonstrates stable operation over 1000 cycles. This work presents a new approach to designing Zn anodes with refined nucleated&#8208;Zn grains and sustainable Zn (0002) plane stacking for advanced ZMBs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing the crystalline orientation to achieve stable Zn (0002) plane growth is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, the lattice strain of Zn substrate hinders stable Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; plating/stripping and sustainable epitaxial growth of Zn (0002) texture. Herein, we present a low-strain strategy to mediate nucleated-Zn grains for stabilizing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; electrodeposition/stripping process and guiding sustainable Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; growth along (0002) surfaces. Fluorinated anthracene triptycene polymer (FATP) photopolymerized on Zn exhibits nanocrystalline structure with highly ordered nanochannels (1.5&#160;nm), enabling oriented nucleation and sustainable epitaxial stacking of Zn (0002) plane due to low nucleation energy (0.2 vs. 1.1&#160;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; of pure Zn) and low grain strain (&#8722;0.2 to 0.4 vs. &#8722;0.9 to 0.9&#160;MPa). Besides, the ordered porous FATP nanofilm refines electroplating Zn grains (9.4 vs. 26.7&#160;&#181;m), alleviating strain accumulation (3.7 vs. 28.2&#160;MPa) and lattice distortion. Consequently, FATP-Zn||Cu cell achieves a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% over 6000 cycles, while FATP-Zn||FATP-Zn cell shows stable plating/stripping after 5000 h. Notably, FATP-Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell (2.77 Ah) demonstrates stable operation over 1000 cycles. This work presents a new approach to designing Zn anodes with refined nucleated-Zn grains and sustainable Zn (0002) plane stacking for advanced ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Avoiding the Kauzmann Paradox via Interface&#8208;Driven Divergence in States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface&#8208;driven stress in core&#8208;shell particle architecture caused by surface speciation creates divergence of associated stress vectors, resulting in nonequilibrium fluxes and deep supercooling. Analysis of nonequilibrium phase models reveals that the addition of an intermediary interfacial state results in evolution in the thermodynamic speed limits that can avoid the entropy catastrophe and resolve the Kauzmann paradox (KP).








Abstract
Kauzmann paradox (KP) suggests that deeply supercooled liquids can have a lower entropy than the corresponding crystalline solids. While this entropy catastrophe has been thoroughly studied via equilibrium thermodynamics, the solidification process occurs far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium. By analyzing this process experimentally and theoretically, we show that surface chemical speciation (oxidation&#8208;driven generation and self&#8208;organization of different species of the alloy components) in core&#8208;shell particles (CSPs) can perturb the entropy production to an extent that a continuum equilibrium phase transition is not possible. Speciation of the surface causes divergence of associated stress vectors that generate nonequilibrium fluxes and frustrates homogeneous nucleation hence deep undercooling. The asymmetry of the speciation&#8208;derived surface tensor skews the minimum entropy production criterion. We analyze a set of nonequilibrium models, one showing and one averting the entropy catastrophe. Applying thermodynamic speed limits to these models, we show that the KP takes another form. Deviations from the speed limit diverge the configurational entropy of the glass, but adding an interfacial state avoids the entropy catastrophe with significantly large supercooling.

         <title>Vanillin&#8208;Derived Degradable and Reprocessable Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxy Resins with High Intrinsic Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three vanillin&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy resins with different aromatic imine structures were prepared. The epoxy resin containing the longest conjugated aromatic imine structures shows the highest intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.38&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). The dynamic chemical features of imine bonds endow the prepared epoxy resins with reprocessability and chemical degradability.








Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;functionality and miniaturized consumer electronics is driving the development of polymer packaging materials with intrinsically high thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel vanillin&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy monomer (BEP) and three curing agents (ICA&#8208;1, ICA&#8208;2, and ICA&#8208;3) containing conjugated aromatic imine structures were synthesized. The results of X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements show that the structural order of the epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs increases with the number of conjugated benzene rings in ICAs. Compared with the conventional epoxy reference (0.23&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), the prepared liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy resins exhibit enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity (0.28&#8211;0.38&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) due to the synergistic effect from the liquid&#8208;crystalline phase structure in BEP and the additional ordered structure (via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) in ICAs. Both experimental and molecular dynamics calculation results show that the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resins is proportional to the length of the conjugated structures in ICAs. Owing to the incorporation of dynamic aromatic imine bonds, the three cured epoxy resins based on BEP and ICAs demonstrate excellent reprocessibility through imine metathesis and are chemically degradable in the amine solution.

         <title>Direct Access to Functional 2&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.1.1]Hexanes via Hydrodearomative [2&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] Cycloaddition of Aza&#8208;Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;noble Mn/Fe bimetallic catalyst system for hydrodearomative cycloaddition reaction of the poorly reactive but extensively distributed aza&#8208;arenes with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been developed. The manganese catalyst is involved in mild hydrodearomatization of the aza&#8208;arenes, while the Fe(OTf)2 as a Lewis acid activates both aza&#8208;arenes and BCBs. DFT calculations revealed that the Fe(II)&#8208;aza&#8208;arene coordination contributes to the 1,4&#8208;hydrogenation of the aza&#8208;arenes, which then generates imine via isomerization, and prevents the thermodynamically favorable N&#8208;heteroaryl overreduction. The developed chemistry offers a practical platform for direct access to functional 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in a step and atom&#8208;economic fashion.








Abstract
Converting planar six&#8208;membered aza&#8208;arenes into C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds is a promising way to obtain isosteric mimetics of numerous functional products, but it remains to date a formidable challenge due to the high thermodynamic stability and dynamic inertness as well as the selectivity control. Here, by applying a novel non&#8208;noble bimetallic Mn/Fe catalyst system, we report, for the first time, an approach for direct construction of functional 3D 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes via a hydrodearomatization (HDA) of the aza&#8208;arenes and [2&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] cycloaddition cascade. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the triplet state of Fe(II) facilitates the activation of both aza&#8208;arenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs). The mild reduction nature of manganese catalysis and the steric effects of Fe(II) coordination result in an 1,4&#8208;hydrodearomatization, and the imine species derived from the isomerization of 1,4&#8208;hydrogenated aza&#8208;arenes are then effectively trapped by the polarized BCBs, thus suppressing the thermodynamically favorable over&#8208;hydrogenation of aza&#8208;arenes into cyclic amine by&#8208;products. Given the features of good substrate and functionality compatibility, high step and atom efficiency, and diversified product post&#8208;transformations, the developed chemistry offers a practical platform to access various functional molecules.

         <title>Ethylene Pretreatment Enhances Ethylene Adsorption and Separation over Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C2H4 pretreatment strategy enhances the performance of one&#8208;pot synthesized Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite, enabling exceptional C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, high C2H4 uptake, and superior dynamic separation factor. This enhanced performance originates from the partial reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), which strengthens the adsorbent&#8211;C2H4 interaction. The proposed strategy offers new insights into designing Cu(I)&#8208;based adsorbents and advancing efficient separation processes for practical applications.








Abstract
Efficient ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) separation using low&#8208;energy technologies is crucial for the chemical industry yet remains challenging due to the lack of industrially applicable adsorbents. Cu(I)&#8208;based adsorbents show significant potential; however, traditional synthesis methods often involve complex procedures or reduction steps. Herein, we report that Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite, synthesized for the first time via a one&#8208;pot method with cyclam as the Cu(II) ligand, exhibits a remarkable C2H4/C2H6 selectivity of 22.6, a C2H4 uptake of 3.08&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1, and a separation factor of 9.4 under ambient conditions by using a C2H4 pretreatment, placing it among the best&#8208;performing zeolitic materials. The C2H4 pretreatment enhances separation efficiency by partially reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and water resistance through the formation of carbon species during pretreatment. Structural analysis using Rietveld refinement reveals that Cu2+ ions occupy the corners of elliptical single 8&#8208;rings (s8r). X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analysis confirms a reduction in the Cu oxidation state, while X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy corroborates the partial conversion of Cu(II) to Cu(I). Periodic density functional theory calculations further reveal that Cu(I) interacts more strongly with C2H4 than Cu(II). With its straightforward synthesis and enhanced performance through C2H4 pretreatment, Cu@SAPO&#8208;RHO zeolite presents a promising solution for industrial&#8208;scale C2H4/C2H6 separation.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient ethylene/ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) separation using low-energy technologies is crucial for the chemical industry yet remains challenging due to the lack of industrially applicable adsorbents. Cu(I)-based adsorbents show significant potential; however, traditional synthesis methods often involve complex procedures or reduction steps. Herein, we report that Cu@SAPO-RHO zeolite, synthesized for the first time via a one-pot method with cyclam as the Cu(II) ligand, exhibits a remarkable C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 22.6, a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of 3.08&#160;mmol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a separation factor of 9.4 under ambient conditions by using a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pretreatment, placing it among the best-performing zeolitic materials. The C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pretreatment enhances separation efficiency by partially reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and water resistance through the formation of carbon species during pretreatment. Structural analysis using Rietveld refinement reveals that Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions occupy the corners of elliptical single 8-rings (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;8&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;). X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis confirms a reduction in the Cu oxidation state, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy corroborates the partial conversion of Cu(II) to Cu(I). Periodic density functional theory calculations further reveal that Cu(I) interacts more strongly with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; than Cu(II). With its straightforward synthesis and enhanced performance through C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pretreatment, Cu@SAPO-RHO zeolite presents a promising solution for industrial-scale C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Chemistry of WC Powder Electrocatalysts Probed In Situ with NAP&#8208;XPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a highly active catalyst for the HER. The reasons for its activity are, however, unclear due to its delicate susceptibility to oxidation and thus passivation. Electrochemical near ambient pressure XPS reveals dissolution of the passive film into the electrolyte under electrochemical working conditions, which effectively enables the electrocatalyst's enduring activity.








Abstract
Tungsten carbide (WC) is a renowned compound catalyst material for electrochemical water splitting, and its high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been repeatedly reported. However, its susceptibility to oxidation raises the fundamental question of the underlying reason for its high activity, especially since passivation and thus potential deactivation can occur not only in air but also during reaction. Hence, the investigation of the surface chemistry under true operating conditions is crucial for a fundamental understanding of the electrocatalytic process. In this work, we use electrochemical X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (EC&#8208;XPS) to revisit the surface chemistry of WC powder electrodes in alkaline electrolyte in situ and under full potential control. Our results show that although the surface is initially covered with oxide, this passive film dissolves in the electrolyte under electrochemical reaction conditions. This clarifies the active surface termination during the HER and highlights the potential of laboratory&#8208;based EC&#8208;XPS to study applied energy conversion materials.

         <title>Hydrogen Binding Energy Is Insufficient for Describing Hydrogen Evolution on Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research introduces a refined volcano model that incorporates both &#916;GH* and &#916;GHO*, addressing the limitations of traditional H models by factoring in HO* adsorption effects. Furthermore; the subquestion was discussed: Whether the metal site in SACs is the only active site? We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically the possibility of substituting neighboring N atoms for metal atoms as active sites in Cu/Ni&#8208;Pc catalysts. 








Abstract
The design principles for metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have been extensively studied. Yet, consensus remains elusive, hindering advancements in hydrogen energy technologies. Although the hydrogen binding energy (&#916;GH*) has long been used as a key HER descriptor during the past two decades, originating from the activity volcano of metallic surfaces, its applicability to HER SACs has been met with significant controversy. Herein, we investigate the effects of HO*/O* poisoning and H* coverage on SACs with varied metal centers and coordination environments using pH&#8208;dependent surface Pourbaix diagrams at the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale and microkinetic modeling. Our findings reveal that HO* poisoning, realistic H* adsorption strengths at active metal sites, and the potential HER activity at the coordinating N&#8208;sites are crucial factors that should be considered for accurate descriptor development. Experimental validation using a series of M&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, Cu) confirms the theoretical predictions, with excellent agreement in exchange current densities and the role of N&#8208;sites in Ni/Cu&#8208;phthalocyanine/CNT catalysts. This work provides answers to a long&#8208;lasting debate on HER descriptors by establishing &#916;GH* and &#916;GHO* as a combined HER descriptor for SACs, offering new guidelines for catalyst design.

         <title>Trifunctionalization of Iodoarenes via Sequence&#8208;Controlled Double Ortho C&#9472;H Acylations by Palladium/Norbornene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd(0)/NBE&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization reaction has been successfully developed for the selective assembly of contiguously substituted aromatic compounds from ortho&#8208;unsubstituted iodoarenes and alkyl/aryl mixed anhydrides combined with a carboxylate anion activator. This domino reaction was realized through sequence&#8208;controlled ortho C&#9472;H alkyl&#8208;acylation, ortho' C&#9472;H aryl&#8208;acylation, and ipso&#8208;termination with an alkenyl or aryl nucleophile.








Abstract
Herein we report a novel palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed trifunctionalization reaction of ortho&#8208;unsubstituted iodoarenes by incorporating two distinct acyl groups at their ortho C&#9472;H positions and replacing the ipso&#8208;iodide with an alkenyl or aryl group. Notably, this transformation was enabled by the alkyl/aryl mixed anhydrides, which were utilized as dual acylation reagents by abstracting their central oxygen atom with electrophilic 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;4,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Mechanistic studies revealed that the alkyl&#8208;acyl unit of such an anhydride was employed for the first C&#9472;H alkyl&#8208;acylation, and in situ released aryl carboxylate anion was then rapidly activated with triazine chloride to provide an aryl&#8211;acyl electrophile for the second C&#9472;H acylation, thus enabling the trifunctionalization of iodoarenes by termination with an intermolecular Heck or intramolecular arylation reaction. In addition, the synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the selective manipulation of carbonyl groups of the products.

         <title>Annulated Radical Cations with a C4E2&#8208;Core (E = P, As, Sb): Stable Pnictogen Analogs of Elusive Aryl Radical Anions of Birch Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The benzene radical anion (C6H6)&#9679;&#8211;, possessing a 7&#960;&#8208;electron count, is a crucial intermediate in the Birch reduction and has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Herein, we report the tricyclic pnictogen radical cations [(ADC)E]2[B], [2&#8208;E][B] (ADC = PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; E = P, As, Sb; [B] = [B1] = B(C6F5)4 or [B2] = {3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}) featuring a central 7&#960;&#8208;electron planar C4E2 ring embedded between two 1,3&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks, as crystalline solids. [2&#8208;E][B] are prepared by one&#8208;electron (1e) oxidations of the corresponding base&#8208;stabilized cyclic pnictinidene compounds [(ADC)E]2 (1&#8208;E). Calculated spin densities (for E = P 76%, As 80%, Sb 88%) and EPR measurements suggest that [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ are pnictogen&#8208;centered radicals and stabilized by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the C4E2 ring. The EPR spectra of [2&#8208;E][B] exhibit characteristic signals for S = &#189; systems with clear hyperfine coupling constants for the two similar P, As or Sb nuclei. Further 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E][B] result in the dicationic 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;species [(ADC)E]2[B]2 [3&#8208;E][B]2, which readily undergo comproportionations with 1&#8208;E to afford [2&#8208;E][B].

         <title>Controlled Growth of Oligophenylene&#8208;Structures on Graphene for Facile Secondary functionalization.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of graphene derivatives is a common approach to tune material properties for use in various applications. Due to the low reactivity of the unsaturated carbon lattice of graphene, not only are few chemical approaches suitable for successful functionalization, such as those involving highly reactive in situ formed radical species or nitrene and carbene compounds, but also the degree of functionalization is usually limited, modifying only a few percent of the carbon atoms. Typically, uncontrolled side reactions such as homocoupling and oligomerization of newly introduced functional groups can occur instead of direct coupling to the carbon lattice. We want to turn this unwanted side reaction into an advantage and use intentionally formed covalent dendrimeric oligophenylene structures for secondary functionalization. We show that these oligomeric structures can be grown to specific thicknesses and used for further functionalization with bromomethyl groups at high density on the surface. This functionalization opens further avenues for subsequent nucleophilic substitution, as exemplified by the introduction of versatile azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The results presented here are not only applicable to large oligophenylene structures, but also demonstrate that, in principle, single aryl moieties on graphene of any size and density can be successfully functionalized.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable Three&#8208;coordinate Base&#8208;Stabilized Alumylene: A Precursor of Persistent Acceptor&#8208;Free Monomeric Aluminum Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An isolable monomeric alumylene stabilized by two donating ligands (phosphine and&#160;NHC) has been synthesized. Experimental and theoretical analysis confirms that the&#160;NHC ligand in the Al(I)&#8208;complex is labile and reversibly dissociates from the AlI center&#160;above &#8208;20 &#176;C. Of particular interest, despite being thermodynamically stabilized by the&#160;two ligands, alumylene complex exhibits a high reactivity with a considerably higher&#160;nucleophilicity compared to the mono&#8208;ligated complex. It is interesting to note that the&#160;Al(I)&#8208;complex reacts immediately with N2O at &#8208;90 &#176;C, allowing the synthesis of bisligated aluminum oxide, which is stable up to &#8208;70 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Total Syntheses of Leuconoxine&#8208;Type Alkaloids Enabled by Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Pyrrole Difunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Concise total syntheses of five leuconoxine&#8208;type alkaloids, i.e., chloromelodinine, leuconodine A, leuconodine F, melodinine E, and leucinixine, are achieved through a pyrrole&#8208;centered strategy. The approach features a newly developed palladium/norbornene&#8208;catalyzed pyrrole double C&#8722;H functionalization reaction to generate the core skeleton and a divergent oxidative dearomatization to complete the end game. In addition, no protecting group was employed, and the strategic use of a chloro substituent offers a number of advantages in these syntheses, which could have implications beyond this work. The discovery of an unusual chloro 1,2&#8208;migration reaction enabled the first total synthesis of chloromelodinine E. This work represents the shortest syntheses of these natural products to date with 10&#8208;11 total steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of Nitriles into a Gold(III)/Carbene Bond: A Direct and Powerful Entry to Imino&#8208;Substituted Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strikingly, very little is known so far about gold(III) carbenes. They have been proposed as key intermediates in a few reactions but remain chemical curiosities. Taking into account the enhanced electrophilicity of cationic Au(III) carbene complexes, we were intrigued by their reactivity with nitriles. Thus, we discovered a simple and efficient entry to imino&#8208;substituted carbenes. The transient (N^C^C)Au(III)&#8592;:CH(dmp)+ carbene readily reacts with acetonitrile, benzonitrile and diisopropyl cyanamide, affording stable and isolable Au(III) carbene complexes. Here, the imino group acts either as a strongly &#960;&#8208;donating or a spectator substituent. Ligand exchange at Au(III) or protodeauration/deprotonation provides access to the corresponding free species which display dual imino&#8208;carbene / nitrile&#8208;ylide reactivity, as substantiated by stoichiometric and catalytic dimerization, O&#8211;H insertion and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(arylene vinylene) for Efficient Electron Transport and Sensitive Chemiresistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked robust 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs), i.e., layered 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (2D PAVs), are emerging as promising polymer semiconductors for electronics and photocatalysis. However, achieving narrow optical band gaps and efficient electron transport remains a significant challenge for this class of materials to enhance the device performance. Here, we report a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type 2D PAV (2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, where TBDT = thienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene, IT = s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetraone) synthesized via an Aldol&#8208;type 2D polycondensation approach. Notably, 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT benefits from an effective intralayer donor&#8208;acceptor effect, exhibiting an optical band gap of 1.15 eV, the smallest among the reported 2D c&#8208;COFs and 2D conjugated polymers. Density functional theory calculations reveal a unique electron&#8208;dominating transport for 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, with a strongly dispersive conduction band minimum and, thus, a small effective mass for electrons half that for holes. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy measurements indicate a high charge mobility of 26&#8201;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature for the powder sample. Given the high electron&#8208;deficiency of 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT for facile electron injection from hazardous gases and the high&#8208;mobility electron&#8208;dominating transport in the material, we further fabricate chemiresistors from 2DPAV&#8208;TBDT&#8208;IT, showing ultrasensitive SO2 analyte detection with limit of detection of 0.088 ppb, significantly surpassing the reported chemiresistive SO2 sensors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thoroughly data&#8208;driven review on chemistry&#8211;properties&#8211;applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze&#8208;dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8208;inorganic composites. Process&#8211;property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by machine&#8208;learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data&#8208;evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.</dc:description>

The decoration with Pt single atoms significantly enhances the photocatalytic activity and selectivity toward ammonia while the quantum confinement effect and p&#8208;type conductivity of the nanotubes maintain their key roles in the photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
We synthesize p&#8208;type TiO2 nanotubes that allow band&#8208;gap adjustment by quantum confinement. These tubes therefore enable reductive photocatalytic reactions that are not thermodynamically possible on classic titania photocatalysts. Here, we demonstrate the direct photocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia without any need of hole scavengers. The quantum confinement effect (and thus the thermodynamic driving force) can be controlled by the thickness of the nanotube walls. Notably, the use of Pt single atoms as cocatalysts decorated on the TiO2 nanotubes additionally offers a superior ammonia production and a remarkable enhanced selectivity compared to Pt nanoparticles. Overall, the work not only highlights the potential of size&#8208;controlled modifications of electronic properties in extending the utility of a most classical photocatalyst but also exemplifies its use in technologically relevant reactions.

         <title>Unraveling CO&#8208;Tolerance Mechanism in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells via Operando Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operando transmission infrared spectroscopic method was developed for real&#8208;time monitoring fuel cell processes. By this method, CO adsorption dynamics and poisoning mechanisms on commercial PtRu/C catalysts were elucidated under fuel cell operando environments for the first time. Beyond the classical bifunctional mechanism, we identified a new CO tolerance pathway involving CO migration from Pt to Ru sites, thereby liberating highly active Pt sites for sustained hydrogen oxidation activity.








Abstract
CO poisoning remains a critical challenge for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Current studies of CO tolerance primarily focus on solid/liquid interfaces (in situ conditions), which differ significantly from PEMFCs' solid/liquid/gas triple&#8208;phase interfaces (operando conditions) in microenvironment and mass transport. Herein, we developed an operando transmission infrared spectroscopy method that enables direct observation of CO tolerance mechanism on commercial PtRu/C catalysts in PEMFCs. Under in situ conditions, hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity is governed by CO mass transfer, and is insensitive to the availability of active sites, while it is highly sensitive under operando conditions due to enhanced mass transfer, thereby aggravating CO poisoning effects. Notably, 76% of HOR activity can recover upon switching to pure H2. Based on CO band evolution, we proposed a new pathway beyond the traditional bifunctional mechanism of CO tolerance: CO migrates from Pt to Ru sites, undergoing oxidation at potentials as low as 0.01&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

         <title>Ion&#8208;Docking Effect Enabling Rechargeable High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium&#8211;Iodine/Chlorine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen ion&#8208;docking effect with solvation&#8208;dependent reaction unlocks high&#8208;energy&#8208;density magnesium batteries, featuring remarkable discharge plateau voltage (3.0&#160;V), high capacity (404&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), ultra&#8208;fast charging (20C), and low&#8208;temperature cycling (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries represent a promising energy storage system by offering low cost and dendrite&#8208;less propensity. However, the limited selection of cathode materials, and often with low voltage and capacity, constrain Mg batteries. Herein, by exploiting the ion&#8208;docking effect between two halogen species&#8212;iodine cations (I+) and chlorine anions (Cl&#8722;)&#8212;we activate the cathodic activity of halogens and develop a magnesium&#8211;iodine/chlorine (Mg&#8208;I/Cl) battery prototype with high energy and power density. The ion&#8208;docking effect enables I+ and Cl&#8722; to mutually balance and disperse their charges, and weakens the coordination strength between Cl&#8722; and Mg2+ while enhancing the stability of I+, thus facilitating the multi&#8208;electron (2&#160;+&#160;1/3) redox reactions of halogens. We also find the solvation state of iodine species determines the reaction process of the I0/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox couples. The here&#8208;developed magnesium&#8211;iodine/chlorine battery features an impressively high discharge plateau of up to 3.0&#160;V with a high capacity exceeding 400&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and demonstrates a stable lifespan for 500 cycles, with the ability of ultra&#8208;fast charging at 20C and low&#8208;temperature cycling under &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. These findings may provide new insights for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Mg battery systems.

         <title>Nuclear&#8208;Targeted Material Enabled Intranuclear MicroRNA Imaging for Tracking Gene Editing Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient nuclear&#8208;targeted material, phenylboronic acid modified linear PEI (LPBA), is reported to load gene editing plasmids and fluorescent probes for tracking microRNA&#8208;21 (miR&#8208;21) gene editing in cancer cells. Based on LPBA, intranuclear miR&#8208;21 precursors (pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21) imaging is achieved, resulting in real&#8208;time detection of the gene editing process in single living cells and in vivo. 








Abstract
Gene editing technology based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) systems serves as an efficient tool in cancer therapy. Tracking the gene editing process can help identify the progress of cancer treatment. However, existing techniques for monitoring the gene editing process rely on lysed cells, which can not reflect the dynamic changes of nucleic acid in living cells. It urgently needs in situ and real&#8208;time imaging technologies to track the gene editing process at a living single&#8208;cell level more effectively and precisely. Here, we reported a highly efficient nuclear&#8208;targeted material, phenylboronic acid modified linear PEI (LPBA), for loading gene editing plasmids and fluorescent probes to track gene editing processes of microRNA. Based on LPBA, we achieved efficient intranuclear microRNA imaging at the living cell level, reaching 32.4&#8208;fold higher than the linear PEI (LPEI) delivery system, which facilitated further sensitive monitoring of the gene editing process both in living cells and in vivo. Meanwhile, this efficient gene&#8208;editing and real&#8208;time detection technique could be extended to screening effective gene&#8208;editing plasmids. Such LPBA&#8208;based imaging technology extended the imaging area of microRNA and offered new insight in the field of gene editing and nucleic acid detection.

         <title>Aqueous Dehydrogenation of Methyl Formate Catalyzed by a Recyclable Polymer&#8208;Grafted Manganese(I) Pincer Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a polymer&#8208;grafted pincer&#8208;type catalyst of earth&#8208;abundant Mn that catalyzes the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging liquid organic hydrogen carrier. This immobilized catalyst retains the well&#8208;defined structure and high reactivity of the corresponding homogeneous molecular catalyst and exhibits marked stability and recyclability, achieving a high total hydrogen&#8208;based TON of 230525 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.








Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are an effective solution for the long&#8208;term storage of hydrogen and its long&#8208;distance transportation, but one that requires efficient catalysis for hydrogen uptake and release. Homogeneous molecular catalysts employed in LOHC systems usually exhibit high reactivity and selectivity but are difficult to recover and reuse, a fact that severely limits their practical application. Herein, we report an easily synthesized polymer&#8208;grafted pincer&#8208;type complex of earth&#8208;abundant manganese, which can catalyze the aqueous dehydrogenation of methyl formate, an emerging LOHC material. Importantly, this immobilized Mn&#8208;pincer catalyst retains the high reactivity of the corresponding molecular catalyst, yet is also recyclable, exhibiting high stability and achieving a total hydrogen&#8208;based turnover number of more than 230000 after 5 consecutive recycling rounds.

         <title>Spatially Coupling Electronic&#8211;Ionic Transport in Organic Mixed Conductors as Cathodes for Efficient Zn&#8211;V Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated mixed electronic&#8211;ionic conductor is developed by spatially coupling transport pathways, enabling redistribution and fast transport of charges. Dual&#8208;conductive pathways assembled at the nanoscale could enhance energy storage by more active sites and fast kinetics. Reversible ionic channels from the self&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping process defend active material against proton corrosion, contributing to excellent areal capacity and cyclability. 








Abstract
In conventional electrodes, concentration polarization by unbalanced charge transport and solid&#8208;state diffusion resistance result in sluggish reaction kinetics, hindering the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we propose an integrated mixed electronic&#8211;ionic conductor by spatially coupling charge transport pathways, which could achieve redistribution and fast transport of charge (Zn2+/e&#8722;). Operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the charge transport mechanisms and intrinsic conducting characteristics at timescale. Through confinement by vanadium oxide, dual&#8208;conductive pathways were self&#8208;assembled at the nanoscale and provided effective charge storage. This provided high charge density and accelerated ionic diffusion in the bulk phase, resulting in more active sites and faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, reversible ionic channels from the self&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping process reduced the dissolution of active materials by protons and enabled conversion chemistry, improving cycling stability at low current density. Consequently, the modulated cathode (PEDOT&#8208;SO3&#8208;ZnVO) delivered a high&#8208;rate performance of 310/148&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (0.2/10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) at 10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the conventional electrode at 21&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 achieved an ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 6.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and superior cycling stability (79.1% retention over 100 cycles at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). This work opens the way for the precise modulation of the electrochemical performance of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Electron Itinerancy Mediated by Oxygen Vacancies Breaks the Inert Electron Chain to Boost Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate synergistic mechanisms between dopants and host matrices remain inadequately elucidated. This study verified that oxygen vacancies (Vo) act as &#8220;electron pumps,&#8221; while Ru1 functions as &#8220;electron buffers,&#8221; thereby successfully enabling &#8220;electron itinerancy&#8221; and activating the [Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ti] electronic chain. Ultimately facilitating the high activity and stability of the bidirectional self&#8208;regulating characteristics inherent to Li&#8211;O2 batteries throughout the cycling process.








Abstract
The synergistic effect of dopants and oxygen vacancies (Vo) in metal oxides is crucial for enhancing the adsorption and electron transfer processes in lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, Ru single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified TiO2 nanorod array (Ru1&#8211;TiO2&#8722;x) electrocatalysts with abundant Vo were fabricated, serving as an efficient catalyst for Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Experimental and theoretical investigations have demonstrated that Vo functions as an &#8220;electron pump&#8221;, facilitating electron itinerant behavior, while Ru1 serves as an &#8220;electron buffer&#8221; to further activate the [Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ti] electronic chain. This synergistic interplay endows Li&#8211;O2 batteries with a highly active and stable bidirectional self&#8208;regulating capability during the process of circulation, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;low charge polarization (0.42V) and exceptional cycling stability (1680 h). Vo and Ru1 synergistically modulate the d&#8208;band center at the Ti site to establish an adaptively tunable Ru&#8211;Ti dual&#8208;active site. This adjustment effectively balances the binding strength with the interface oxygen intermediate (*O), thereby significantly reducing the activation barrier. The Hamiltonian layout further revealed the crucial role of remote orbital coupling in maintaining the structural stability. This study not only provides profound insights into Vo&#8208;dependent electron transfer kinetics but also proposes new strategies and theoretical guidance for the activation of inert materials.

         <title>Novel Light&#8208;Promoted Bioorthogonal Reaction via Molecular Recombination for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyrrole and Its Application in In Vitro and In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel light&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal multifunctionalized molecular recombination (LBMR) reaction that can facilitate the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles under normal physiological conditions. The LBMR reaction exhibited rapid kinetics, high efficiency, a wide substrate scope, and the potential for fluorescence imaging on different types of cells and zebrafish.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized organic, medicinal, and biochemical research by designing and developing selective and rapid reactions that do not interfere with biological processes. Despite significant advancements, the existing bioorthogonal reactions can normally introduce only one functional group to a biomolecule, limiting their versatility in biological systems. In this study, we report a novel light&#8208;promoting reaction, namely light&#8208;promoted bioorthogonal multifunctionalized molecular recombination (LBMR) reaction, that can facilitate the synthesis of polysubstituted pyrroles via molecular editing and recombination of isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylate and isoxazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives. The proposed LBMR reaction exhibited rapid kinetics, high efficiency, wide substrate scope, and the potential for in situ fluorescence imaging under normal physiological conditions without the need for a catalyst. The LBMR reaction allowed incorporating multiple functional groups and using well&#8208;soluble carboxylic salts as bioorthogonal substrates. The in vitro experiments performed in different types of cells and the in vivo studies performed on zebrafish demonstrated the potential applicability of the proposed LBMR for biological imaging. This work not only introduces a new photo&#8208;bioorthogonal reaction paradigm but also expands the scope of bioorthogonal chemistry, paving the way for future applications in biomedical research.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Containing Hybrid SEI Layer Enabling High Mass Loading and Anode&#8208;Less Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium&#8208;containing hybrid SEI layer is designed for the Na metal anode by incorporating inorganic components (e.g., LiF, Li&#8323;N, and Li&#8322;CO&#8323;) from the SEI layer of a Li metal anode. This design leverages the advantages of the SEI layer formed on Li anodes, which has a higher Young's modulus and better electrochemical stability (due to the lower redox voltage window of Li metal) compared to that formed on Na anodes. Simulations and extensive characterizations reveal that, with the benefits of high ionic conductivity, enhanced Young's modulus, reduced interfacial side reactions, and uniform Na+ deposition, the system achieves robust electrochemical performance in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The continuous rupturing and rebuilding of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer during cycling would block Na+ diffusion and induce Na dendrite formation, ultimately limiting the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium metal batteries. Herein, a hybrid SEI layer containing Li&#8208;species is dexterously constructed on the surface of sodium metal anode. Li&#8208;containing inorganic components (Li3N, LiF, and Li2CO3) are introduced to stabilize the Na/electrolyte interface and enhance the mechanical and diffusion kinetic properties of the SEI layer, which can reduce the side reactions and gas generation, regulate Na+ flux during cycling and promote rapid Na+ migration for uniform dendrite&#8208;free Na deposition. As a result, the constructed Na symmetric cells achieve low overpotential and long cycle life of 5900, 1800, and 500&#160;h at current densities of 3, 10, and 30&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the full cells paired with the Na&#8323;V&#8322;(PO&#8324;)&#8323; cathode demonstrate high specific capacity and excellent cycle stability, even at an ultra&#8208;high cathode loading of 39.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low N/P ratio (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio of 1.21).

         <title>Cation&#8208;in&#8208;Mesopore Complex for 20 Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suppression of solvent water activity, along with the regulation of Zn2&#8314; solvation structures and interfacial side reactions, represents the primary objectives in electrolyte design, which prejudices the cycle life of an aqueous battery. In this work, we introduce a novel cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore complex, where Zn2+ cations are confined within a single mesoporous SiO2 cavity, disrupting the contact ion pair solvation structure of Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding between solvated water molecules. The Zn2+&#8211;smSiO2 complexes facilitate the formation of mesopore weak H&#8208;bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H2O.








Abstract
Metallic Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) have arisen as one of the most promising safe energy storage solutions, yet practical development, especially for the Ah&#8208;level ZABs, is severely plagued by unmanageable side reactions and notorious dendrite proliferation. Here, we propose a cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore (CiM) complex chemistry by confining Zn2+ within single&#8208;mesopore cavities to construct a novel paradigm of 20 Ah&#8208;level ZABs. Molecule dynamic and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal that the single&#8208;mesopore SiO2 (smSiO2) traps Zn2+, replacing H2O molecules in the primary sheath and forming Zn2+&#8211;smSiO2 complexes. In situ electrochemical digital holography, in situ interface Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and H&#8208;bonds density analyses clearly confirm that Zn2+&#8211;smSiO2 complexes migrate and adhere onto the metallic Zn, facilitating the formation of mesopore weak H&#8208;bonds interface by disrupting the aggregation of solvated H2O. Consequently, the Zn anode operates over 800&#160;h under 55% depth of discharge, effectively suppressing H2O degradation and dendrite growth. The Zn//VO2 pouch battery demonstrates capacities of 20.5 Ah at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and 8.59 Ah at 1 A g&#8722;1, and energy density of 65&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 96&#160;Wh L&#8722;1. The proposed cation&#8208;in&#8208;mesopore complex chemistry may mark a substantial step forward towards more sustainable and reliable ZABs.

         <title>Reactive Hydrogen Species Behaviors on Pd/TiN: In Situ SERS Guided Regulation for Chemoselective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screening Pd catalysts with D2. Through in situ Raman tracing the &#957;N&#8208;D and &#957;Pd&#8208;D on SiO2@Pd@TiN@Pd, a clear Pd site structure&#8208;D2 dissociation/migration behavior relationship is observed. This enables the screening of Pd/TiN catalysts with the desired Pd structure for effective chemoselective hydrogenation using D2 as a probe.








Abstract
Uncovering the H2 dissociation and H&#8208;spillover behaviors of the generated reactive hydrogen species on catalyst surfaces is crucial for achieving efficient and chemoselective hydrogenation. However, those behaviors remain largely elusive given the challenges of directly observing H atoms, the smallest atoms in the element table. Herein, we explored the Pd site&#8211;specific D2 cleavage and the H&#8208;spillover behaviors of dissociated D on the titanium nitride (TiN) support via in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopically (SERS). Besides facilitated forming Pd single atom (Pd1), fully exposed Pd cluster (Pdn) and Pd nanoparticles, dissociated D2 on Pd sites (indicated by &#957;Pd&#8211;D at 1,800&#160;cm&#8722;1), spillover to TiN, and formation of the N&#9472;D bond (indicated by &#957;N&#8211;D at 2,400&#160;cm&#8722;1) were spectroscopically traceable. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation, Pdn is identified as the most favorable site for the provision of reactive H through hydrogen spillover. Moreover, we propose &#957;Pd&#8208;D and the &#957;N&#8208;D/&#957;Pd&#8208;D ratio as the index to relative amounts of Pd1 and Pdn sites, respectively, and develop an in situ SERS&#8208;based method to study the synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;activity relationship of Pd/TiN catalyst with an optimized structure for chemoselective hydrogenation.

         <title>Facile Access to Piezoelectric Polyamides by Polyamidation of Carboxylic Acids and Ynamides for Potent Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We establish a simple polyamidation of carboxylic acids and ynamides to synthesize versatile piezoelectric polyamides, with the merits of 100% atom economy, no waste generation, and additive&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free system. Tetraphenylethene containing polyamides can generate reactive oxygen species and elicit robust immunogenic cell death induction for suppressing distant tumor proliferation under US irradiation. This work provides a strategy to designing new piezoelectric polymers for effective tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Polyamides are a fascinating group of piezoelectric materials that are largely synthesized by the polycondesation of dicarboxylic acids with diamines or the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of special lactams. However, developing a green polymerization approach for the facile synthesis of piezoelectric polyamides is highly desirable but also challenging. Here, a simple polyamidation of carboxylic acids and ynamides is successfully established to synthesize versatile piezoelectric polyamides. This polymerization also possesses the merits of 100% atom economy, no waste generation, and additive&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free system. A range of polyamides are synthesized in moderate to good yields with satisfactory molecular weights. Importantly, piezoelectric polyamides containing tetraphenylethene (P1e/2b) can generate a bundant reactive oxygen species under ultrasound (US) exposure, thereby eliciting robust immunogenic cell death induction for augmented piezoelectric immunotherapy. Furthermore, P1e/2b exhibits distinctive aggregation&#8208;induced emission property that allows fluorescence imaging. In vivo evaluation using a bilateral tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model manifested that P1e/2b administration reinforced systemic immunity and triggered immune memory under US exposure, thereby leading to primary tumor eradication and distant tumor suppression. Therefore, this work represents a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and waste&#8208;free polymerization paradigm for the construction of piezoelectric polyamides, providing a distinct strategy to designing new piezoelectric polymers for effective tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Constructing Stable and Wavelength&#8208;Extended Heptamethine Cyanines via Donor Ectopic Substitution for NIR&#8208;IIa/b Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR&#8208;II cyanine. These novel dyes (NIR&#8208;ACs) exhibited an excellent stability, great emission redshift, and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb). Using these dyes, we have successfully achieved high&#8208;contrast tumor and bone&#8208;targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging.








Abstract
Organic NIR&#8208;II dyes, particularly cyanine fluorophores, offer high molar extinction coefficients, biocompatibility, and structural tunability and are popular for noninvasive, high&#8208;resolution, and &#8208;contrast in vivo imaging. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;wavelength, and large Stokes shift NIR&#8208;II cyanine suitable for NIR&#8208;IIa/IIb bioimaging is still a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy that extends the emission wavelength by the enhanced Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)&#8211;Lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) separation through simple donor ectopic substitution at the terminal structure of NIR&#8208;II cyanine. Compared to the original NIR&#8208;II cyanine Flav7, these novel dyes (NIR&#8208;ACs) exhibited a significant emission redshift and larger Stokes shift, with the maximum emission wavelength exceeding 1300&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIa) and a tail emission exceeding 1500&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb). Notably, they also demonstrate excellent stability and deeper tissue imaging ability in vivo imaging. Finally, through surface modification of nanoparticles, NIR&#8208;ACs nanoparticles (NPs) have successfully achieved high&#8208;contrast tumor and bone&#8208;targeted detecting as well as multicolor imaging, providing robust tools for in vivo diagnostics and biomedical research.

         <title>Strategy Formulation for Mitigating Capacity Fading of Na&#8208;Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use commercial NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 cathode as an analysis object. The underlying mechanism for the capacity fading of NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322; full cells is deeply understood. We established screening criteria for electrolyte additives that improve capacity retention. A new compound, C6H18NNaSi2, is selected to greatly enhance the electrochemical performance. This could in turn drive the commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. 








Abstract
The mechanisms underlying capacity fading during cycling in layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries remain inadequately understood. It is essential to elucidate the reasons and propose effective strategies. Here, the capacity&#8208;fading mechanism of commercial NaFe1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 is due to the dissolution of iron ions. Additionally, the extraction of sodium ions (after the Fe3+/Fe4+ reaction) lowers the energy level of NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322; below that of the electrolyte solvent, thereby inducing solvent decomposition. We establish screening criteria for electrolyte additives through theoretical calculations to improve capacity retention. We identified a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing Lewis base additives that can kinetically bind efficiently to iron ions in NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322; and thermodynamically exhibit stronger electron&#8208;donating abilities than the solvents. A new compound, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (which has not been studied as a Na&#8208;ion battery additive before), is selected through the Reaxys database (out of 61 molecules) because it is commercially available at a low price and is relatively stable in the electrochemical process. Such an additive is demonstrated to greatly improve the Coulombic efficiency and reduce the dissolution of iron ions of NaFe&#8321;/&#8323;Mn&#8321;/&#8323;Ni&#8321;/&#8323;O&#8322;//hard carbon cells.

         <title>Benzamide&#8208;Directed Hydroarylative Cross&#8208;Couplings Using Minimally Activated Alkenes: Enantioselective Synthesis of Tertiary and Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzamide&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed branched selective and enantioselective C(sp2)&#8208;H additions to minimally activated alkenes give tertiary and quaternary benzylic stereocenters under byproduct&#8208;free conditions. The processes are enabled by a family of SPINOL&#8208;based homochiral diphosphonite ligands.








Abstract
Ir&#8208;systems modified with ferrocene&#8208;based homochiral diphosphonite ligands, prepared from functionalized SPINOL derivatives, promote benzamide&#8208;directed hydroarylative cross&#8208;couplings involving minimally activated alkenes. The processes are highly branched selective and enantioselective. Accordingly, tertiary benzylic stereocenters are generated under byproduct&#8208;free conditions. This contrast with conventional cross&#8208;coupling approaches, which are less step and atom economical. Preliminary results show that the process extends to the formation of quaternary benzylic stereocenters.

         <title>Stable Cobalt&#8211;Zeolite Propane&#8208;Dehydrogenation Catalysts Enabled by Reaction&#8208;Driven Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that reaction&#8208;driven CoOx reconstruction within S&#8208;1 zeolite yields a highly efficient and durable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation that outperforms the previously reported performance of Co&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the importance of reaction&#8208;driven reconfiguration in catalyst design and provides a simple strategy for developing high&#8208;performance PDH catalysts.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts have emerged as promising substitutes for Pt&#8208; and Cr&#8208;based propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts. However, controlling the distribution of Co species and achieving stable active centers remains challenging. Here, we report that reaction&#8208;driven reconstruction of metallic cobalt (Co0) species within pure silica MFI zeolite (S&#8208;1) into CoOx clusters within silanol nests during PDH yields efficient and durable performance. Atomically dispersed CoOx clusters exhibit exceptional durability and high propylene space&#8208;time yield (STY), maintaining an ultrahigh propylene STY of 17.2&#160;mmolC3H6&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 for over 260&#160;h under industrially relevant conditions, surpassing previous cobalt&#8208;based PDH catalysts. Moreover, the catalyst operates stably at 520&#160;&#176;C for 170&#160;h with near&#8208;equilibrium propane conversions. Comprehensive characterizations indicate the dynamic evolution process from the silanol nests effectively capturing and stabilizing Co0 species within S&#8208;1 zeolite, thereby promoting the dynamic formation of CoOx clusters during the PDH process. We also demonstrate that stable Co&#9472;O active centers formed by this unique anchoring strategy improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation and promoting efficient propane dehydrogenation.

         <title>Revealing Collaborative Effects of Binary Additives on Regulating Precursor Crystallization Toward Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of both PMAI and 2PACz into the precursor effectively cleaves edge&#8208;shared Pb&#8208;I octahedra to facilitate the transformation from PbI2 to PbI3&#8722; complexes as prenucleation clusters, and thus produces much larger colloidal particles with accelerated nucleation. Simultaneously, the crystallization in both spin&#8208;coating and annealing processes is significantly postponed owing to the stronger interaction between perovskite and binary additives with more functional groups. Benefiting from such rapid nucleation and slow crystallization, high&#8208;quality perovskite layer with larger&#8208;sized crystals and fewer defects is formed, and the corresponding device could achieve a high efficiency of 26.05% (certified 25.49%).








Abstract
Fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite layers is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. Considering the significant advancements made in additive engineering for optimizing perovskite crystallization using single additive, exploring the collaborative effect of dual additives on precursor for perovskite crystallization may be an effective way for further advancing device performance. Herein, a binary additives strategy is proposed, where phenylmethylammonium iodide (PMAI) and [2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz) are introduced into the precursor. Compared with the precursor with no additives or a single additive (PMAI or 2PACz), the use of dual additives more effectively cleaves edge&#8208;shared Pb&#8208;I octahedra to expedite the transformation from PbI2 to PbI3&#8722; complexes as prenucleation clusters and produces much larger colloidal particles with accelerated nucleation. Concurrently, the crystallization in both spin&#8208;coating and annealing processes is significantly retarded due to the stronger interaction between perovskite and binary additives. Benefiting from such rapid nucleation and slow crystallization, high&#8208;quality perovskite layer with larger&#8208;sized crystals and fewer defects is formed, resulting in mitigated microstrain, enhanced charge extraction, and suppressed nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the device derived from the use of dual additives could achieve an impressive efficiency of 26.05% (certified 25.49%) and retained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1200 h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dipeptide Surface Functionalization of Detonation Nanodiamond for Enhanced Control in Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing nanoparticles as innovative theranostic agents for biomedical applications requires full control over the material&#8217;s properties to dictate their interactions within a biological environment. Owing to its versatile surface chemistry and high biocompatibility, nanodiamond (ND) represents a promising platform for novel healthcare treatments. To ensure the performance and safety of NDs, their properties and behavior must remain unchanged upon administration, a key challenge in nanomedicine. Recently, zwitterionic surface modifications have emerged as new strategies to substantially improve protein&#8208;repelling properties and biocompatibility of nanomaterials. Using for the first time covalently conjugated zwitterionic dipeptides as surface modulators for ND particles, we were able to provide a readily accessible, reproducible and tunable functionalization. The obtained particles demonstrate enhanced colloidal stability and conservation of particle size over a broad pH range and in different protein&#8208;containing media compared to the starting material. By simple selection of different dipeptides, we can carefully tailor the biocompatibility and cellular uptake of functionalized NDs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Utilizing nanoparticles as innovative theranostic agents for biomedical applications requires full control over the material&#8217;s properties to dictate their interactions within a biological environment. Owing to its versatile surface chemistry and high biocompatibility, nanodiamond (ND) represents a promising platform for novel healthcare treatments. To ensure the performance and safety of NDs, their properties and behavior must remain unchanged upon administration, a key challenge in nanomedicine. Recently, zwitterionic surface modifications have emerged as new strategies to substantially improve protein-repelling properties and biocompatibility of nanomaterials. Using for the first time covalently conjugated zwitterionic dipeptides as surface modulators for ND particles, we were able to provide a readily accessible, reproducible and tunable functionalization. The obtained particles demonstrate enhanced colloidal stability and conservation of particle size over a broad pH range and in different protein-containing media compared to the starting material. By simple selection of different dipeptides, we can carefully tailor the biocompatibility and cellular uptake of functionalized NDs. We reveal the functionalized NDs&#8217; behavior in biologically relevant 3D organotypic models and how different dipeptide functionalized NDs interact with squamous epithelium ex-vivo. The results pave the way for various applications, e.g., biosensing, tissue engineering or targeted drug delivery of these highly biologically suitable nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of Concentrated Formate via CO2 Electrolysis Integrated with Cl2 Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating CO2 electrolysis with an industrially relevant anodic reaction enhances the economic feasibility and reduces carbon emissions in practical operations. In this study, we present an electrosynthesis strategy that integrates the CO2 reduction reaction to produce concentrated formate solution with the Cl2 formation in cation exchange membrane&#8208;based electrolyzers, scaling from 1 cm2 to 100 cm2 electrode areas. Our process, equipped with two automated pH regulation strategies, achieved selectivities over 80% for formate and 95% for chlorine in a 25 cm2 electrolyzer. Additionally, it demonstrated the ability to achieve formate concentrations up to 5.4 M during extended operation periods, establishing a new benchmark for electrochemical formate/formic acid synthesis. Techno&#8208;economic assessment and life cycle assessment further validated the process' sustainability, demonstrating a realistic path to profitability for valuable chemical production from CO2 even without considering potential subsidies and carbon taxes.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Substituted Porous C2N Frameworks as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a green avenue for decarbonizing the conventional chemical industries. Here, a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship of catalysts is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active CO2RR pathway. We report the fabrication of an oxygen&#8208;substituted C2N as metal&#8208;free catalyst (O&#8208;C2N) for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with tunable O microenvironment. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored N&#8208;C&#8208;O moiety in O&#8208;C2N, where C&#8208;O&#8208;C species (e.g. ring in&#8208;plane ether) become the dominant oxygen configurations at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on experimental observations, a correlation between the exocyclic O&#8208;substituted N&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;C moieties and CO selectivity is established, giving clear chemical tools for active structure design. The optimized O&#8208;C2N electrocatalysts with the dominant appearance of C&#8208;O&#8208;C moieties exhibits an outstanding 2e&#8208; CO2RR performance with a CO selectivity up to 94.8%, which can be well maintained in a practical flow&#8208;cell reactor with an adjustable syngas feature.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox Autocatalysis: Towards a Library of Generally Applicable Sulfonamide Reductive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox autocatalysis is revealed to access cyclic biaryl sulfonamides (BASNs) without an initial exogenous photocatalyst. While unveiling photoredox autocatalysis is important to the enrichment of basic research, this has also led to further practical applications such as rapid discovery of novel, potent and readily accessible photocatalyst scaffolds, BASNs, which catalyze manifolds of meaningful transformations.







Abstract
Dichotomous thinking dominates the field of synthetic photochemistry&#8212;either a reaction needs a photocatalyst or not. Herein, we report the identification of a photoredox autocatalytic pathway &#8208; an alternative to the existing mechanistic paradigms &#8208; to access cyclic biaryl sulfonamides (BASNs). This reaction does not require exogenous catalyst as the visible light absorbing deprotonated product &#8208; with potent excited state reductive power &#8208; acts as the photocatalyst for its own synthesis. This finding implicated BASN as a novel organophotocatalyst architecture and allowed a rapid, modular, and low&#8208;cost combinatorial synthesis of a BASN library that expedited optimal photocatalyst screening. Furthermore, BASN was revealed as a widely applicable organophotocatalyst for diverse transition metal&#8208;free transformations such as: intramolecular (spiro)&#8208;cyclizations, defunctionalizations, and C&#8722;C / C&#8208;heteroatom couplings.

         <title>Perovskite Homojunction Solar Cells by Buried Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing a strong p&#8208;n junction is an effective strategy to drive the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and boost the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. However, forming p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconductors in metal halide perovskites is not as straightforward as in the archetypal Si by doping electron&#8208;accepting and electron&#8208;donating elements. Here we observe the transition of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type characteristics in a monolithic perovskite layer via buried interface engineering. The perfluorinated copper phthalocyanine (F16CuPc) molecules with strong electronegativity are employed to modify the NiOx/Me&#8208;2PACz substrate, which not only facilitates the crystallization of perovskite, but also induces the formation of p&#8208;type perovskite at its buried interface. We observe a gradual shift of the Fermi level across bandgap from near valence band at perovskite buried interface to near conduction band at perovskite top surface, manifesting the transition of p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type within the monolithic perovskite layer. Such p&#8208;n homojunction in a perovskite solar cell provides an extra electric field for accelerating charge carrier transportation and thus enhances the corresponding device photovoltaic performance. The F16CuPc induced perovskite homojunction solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 25.0% and it retained over 80% of its initial efficiency for more than 1100 hours.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular gels assembled from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) are fascinating soft materials for use in synthesis, combining aspects of hetero&#8208; and homogeneous systems. The unique combination of environments within a gel offers the ability to control reactivity in new ways. For example, self&#8208;assembly into a gel network can modify the reactivity of catalytic sites on the LMWG. Controlling the assembly of multiple LMWGs can result in integrated gels with orthogonal activities that could not normally co&#8208;exist. Enzymes encapsulated within self&#8208;assembled gels can exhibit superactivity, extending their use into solvent media more appropriate for organic synthesis. Highly reactive species, such as ligand&#8208;free nanoparticles or moisture/air&#8208;sensitive organometallics can be protected within the unique environment of a supramolecular gel, facilitating their use in ambient conditions, potentially opening up the use of such species to non&#8208;specialist researchers. Beyond fundamental chemistry, performing reactions in gels leads to the emerging concept of gels as &#8216;nanoreactors&#8217;.

         <title>Competitive Coordination Induced Crystallization Regulation for Efficient and Stable Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The faster crystallization rate of Sn perovskite compared with Pb perovskite leads to the spatial component inhomogeneity and inferior quality of the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films, which increases the quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) deficit and accelerates the oxidative degradation of the films, thus undercutting the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells. Herein, we propose a thermodynamic selective strategy to mediate the crystallization rate between the Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskite by introducing methyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5&#8208;AH) in perovskite precursor solution. The SnI2 competes with PbI2 in coordinating with 5&#8208;AH to form the thermodynamically favored SnI2&#8208;5&#8208;AH adducts with stronger SnI2&#8208;Cl&#8722; according to molecular orbital interactions, thereby delaying the crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite. Such crystallization regulation improves the composition uniformity and the crystallization quality, which effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and reduces the QFLS deficit. Additionally, the strong interaction between Sn2+ and 5&#8208;AH as well as reductive grain boundaries inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, the optimal devices with 5&#8208;AH exhibit an improved PCE of 23.76% with a high voltage of 0.885 V and long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 89% of initial efficiency under continuous irradiation for 1100 h at the maximum power point under AM 1.5G.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a thermodynamic selective strategy to mediate the crystallization rate between the Sn- and Pb-based perovskite by introducing methyl 5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (5-AH) in perovskite precursor solution. The SnI2 competes with PbI2 in coordinating with 5-AH to form the thermodynamically favored SnI2-5-AH adducts with stronger SnI2-Cl&#8722; according to molecular orbital interactions, thereby delaying the crystallization of Sn-based perovskite. Such crystallization regulation improves the composition uniformity and the crystallization quality, which effectively suppresses non-radiative recombination and reduces the QFLS deficit. Additionally, the strong interaction between Sn2+ and 5-AH as well as reductive grain boundaries inhibits the oxidation of Sn2+. Therefore, the optimal devices with 5-AH exhibit an improved PCE of 23.76% with a high voltage of 0.885 V and long-term stability, maintaining 89% of initial efficiency under continuous irradiation for 1100 h at the maximum power point under AM 1.5G.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Extraction&#8208;Triggered Phase Engineering of Rhodium Nanomaterials for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase engineering plays a crucial role in tuning the physicochemical properties of noble metal nanomaterials. However, synthesis of high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase noble metal nanomaterials remains highly challenging via current wet&#8208;chemical methods. Herein, we develop a unique synthetic methodology to prepare freestanding unconventional hexagonal&#8208;close packed (2H) Rh nanoplates (NPLs) via a rationally designed two&#8208;step strategy. By extracting C from pre&#8208;synthesized rhodium carbide of different sizes and morphology, phase&#8208;controlled synthesis of Rh nanomaterials can be achieved. Impressively, the obtained parallelogram 2H Rh NPLs have high phase purity, well&#8208;defined 2H (0001)h and (10[[EQUATION]]0)h facets, and good thermostability (stable up to 300 &#176;C). In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), the 2H Rh NPLs achieve higher ammonia (NH3) Faradaic efficiency (91.9%) and NH3 yield rate (156.97 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1) with lower overpotentials compared to the conventional face&#8208;centered cubic Rh nanocubes with (100)f facets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional (0001)h surface has energetically favored NO3RR pathway and stronger H*absorption ability compared to the (100)f surface, which may lead to the higher activity and selectivity of NH3 production on 2H Rh NPLs. This work opens new avenues to the rational synthesis of unconventional&#8208;phase metal nanomaterials and provides important guidelines to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Interfacial Ion Exchange in Composite Electrolyte to Realize High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, the poor cross&#8208;phase Li+ transport restricts the rate performance and cycle life of the batteries. Herein, we revealed the Li+ percolation behavior in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based CSEs with Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 filler. The de&#8208;coordination barrier from Li+ clusters determines interfacial Li+ transport capability. We then employed a designed N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetamide (NMTFA) ligand to lower the de&#8208;coordination energy and activate interfacial Li+ exchange, The ionic conductivity is therefore increased from 3.32&#215;10&#8208;4 to 7.30&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1. By tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution process, it was identified that the proportion of interfacial Li+ transport increases from 11% to 26%. The NMTFA also contributes to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich interphases with electrodes. As a result, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2400, 3000 and 10000 times at 2, 5 and 10C, respectively, as well as achieve 1000 cycles at 50 &#176;C and 300 cycles at &#8208;30 &#176;C. This work highlights the critical role of interfacial Li+ transport for the CSEs with &#8220;polymer&#8208;Li+ clusters&#8208;filler&#8221; configuration to realize high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites in Ordered Macroporous Architectures for Enhanced C2H4 Production from CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic C2H4 synthesis from CO2 and H2O by utilizing solar energy represents a promising sustainable process, yet its efficiency remains significantly limited. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;engineered strategy integrating three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous (3DOM) architectures with heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal active sites to synergistically promote the photocatalytic C2H4 production. As an example, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst was synthesized by in situ incorporating Cu single atoms (Cu SAs) into 3DOM In2O3 through a template&#8208;assisted pyrolysis process. The strong interaction between Cu SAs and In2O3 resulted in the formation of charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#8211;In active sites along with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs). 3DOM architectures serving as special nanoreactors displayed significant advantages in promoting CO2 enrichment and confining key intermediates, thereby increasing *CO coverage. Meanwhile, the charge&#8208;polarized Cu&#8208;In active sites effectively mitigated electrostatic repulsion and promoted the formation of *CO+*CHO intermediates, resulting in a thermodynamically spontaneous C&#8208;C coupling step. Therefore, the Cu/3DOM&#8208;In2O3 photocatalyst exhibited robust CO2 reduction to C2H4, achieving high C2H4 evolution rates under various CO2 concentrations, including pure CO2, 10% CO2 in Ar, and 0.04% CO2 in Ar. This work offers a novel strategy for the construction of photocatalysts with tailored microstructures and specific active sites to promote the conversion of CO2 and H2O into multicarbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature and Solvent Dual Switch Photochromic Chiral Ionic Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Advanced Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;response encryption materials with temperature control and time resolution have attracted widespread attention due to their unique response characteristics and higher application security. The design and development of photochromic crystalline materials with multiple stimulus responses remain challenging. In this study, we report a pair of responsive photochromic chiral ionic hydrogen bonded organic framework (iHOF) R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19 controlled by both temperature and solvent through charge&#8208;assisted synthesis. The chromophore tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE) acts as an electron donor and (1R/S,2R/S)&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine (R/S&#8208;DPEN) as an electron acceptor and chiral source. Water and methanol molecules connect the donor and acceptor and interact to build a 3D supramolecular framework. Notably, water and methanol molecules form independent hydrogen&#8208;bonding channels within the iHOF structural framework providing a transfer path for the photoinduced electrons. Surprisingly, the formation of a continuous chiral supramolecular framework by R/S&#8208;DPEN while generating photo&#8208;induced radicals under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation at &#8208;20 &#176;C imparts excellent circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) properties to R/S&#8208;iHOF&#8208;19. The glum values reach &#8208;1.8 &#215; 10&#8208;3 and +3.75 &#215; 10&#8208;3, respectively, and show an enhancement of the circular polarisation of light with decreasing temperature. This CPL with unique low&#8208;temperature stimulus&#8208;responsive photochromism provides new guidance and perspectives for the development of information security and multiple encryption materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual MurC Ligase and Peptidoglycan Discovered in Lachnospiraceae Using a Fluorescent&#160; L&#8208;Amino Acid Based Selective Labeling Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing selective labeling probes for specific bacterial taxa can not only facilitate the study of target bacteria but also deepen our understanding of the microbial diversity at structural and molecular levels. The availability of such probes, however, remains very limited. In this study, by exploiting the variation of amino acids in peptidoglycan stem peptide, we designed a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid probe and found that it could&#160;selectively target the family Lachnospiraceae (a major Gram&#8208;positive family in murine gut microbiome) in vivo. The following in vitro test using two Roseburia species validated the probe's labeling. We then discovered that the labeling site was the first amino acid (L&#8208;alanine in most bacteria), which links the stem peptide with&#160;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid, a process catalyzed by a highly conserved enzyme MurC. Enzyme assay of Roseburia MurC demonstrated its ability to conjugate a fluorescent L&#8208;amino acid and other non&#8208;L&#8208;Ala amino acids to UPD&#8208;N&#8208;acetylmuramic acid. Subsequent X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis uncovered a substantially enlarged inner space in this enzyme, which can partially explain its tolerance to these atypical substrates. The resulting unusual peptidoglycan structures lead to significantly reduced activation of the NOD immune receptors, suggesting a new mechanism for the host to accommodate these highly abundant commensals.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Coordinated Electrolytes for Fast&#8208;charging and Low&#8208;temperature Energy&#8208;dense Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes are known as the dominant factors for fast&#8208;charging affordability and low&#8208;temperature capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the current electrolytes can hardly simultaneously satisfy all the required characteristics, including sufficient ion transport, high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, and fast de&#8208;solvation process over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Here, we report a solution by designing electrolyte solvents that coordinate with Li+ in steric configuration. The steric coordinated electrolytes (SCEs) can overcome the dilemma of quasi&#8208;planer coordinated ether electrolytes that has to be weakly coordinated with Li+ to avoid solvent co&#8208;intercalation towards graphite (Gr) anode, therefore enabling the merits including sufficiently dissociation of Li&#8208;salt with high ionic conductivity, low de&#8208;solvation energy, and forming electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with low energy barrier. As results, the SCEs with only single&#8208;salt and single&#8208;solvent (trimethoxymethane) achieve fast kinetics towards Gr anode and high oxidation stability. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Gr LIBs can reach 80% state of the charge in 6 min, and the Ah&#8208;level energy&#8208;dense pouch cells (4.5&#8208;volt) retain 82.96% (500 cycles) and 85.94% (200 cycles) of initial capacities at room temperature and &#8208;20&#176;C, respectively. Our work deepens the fundamental understanding of Li&#8208;ion solvation structures and affords an effective approach to design sustainable fluro&#8208;free electrolytes for battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Equilibrium in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Transition Metal Complexes: Selective Isolation of Multinuclear Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The AgI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes (3a,b) derived from a bis(NHC) ligand 1, which exhibit a temperature&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium between the trinuclear and tetranuclear forms has been successfully isolated, that is slow on NMR time scale. Intriguingly, by freezing this slow equilibrium, facilitated by strong and stable H&#8208;bonding, we could achieve selective isolation of the tetranuclear species (3a,b&#8208;II). On the other hand, encapsulation of an anionic guest, ClO4, led to exclusive formation of the guest encapsulated trinuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complex, 3a&#8208;I. This is unprecedented and marks the first instance where selective isolation of both the species involved in an equilibrium using a C&#8208;donor ligand could be attained. In contrast, distinct behavior was observed with the AuI&#8208;ion, possessing the same linear geometry however with stronger M&#8208;CNHC bonds. In this context, a stable non&#8208;exchangeable &#8776; 1:1 mixture (4a,b) of the tri&#8208; and tetranuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complexes were obtained via transmetalation of both the equilibrating (3a,b) and the H&#8208;bonded tetranuclear AgI&#8208;NHC complexes (3a,b&#8208;II). Moreover, by aptly adjusting the reaction parameters of transmetalation process, the trinuclear AuI&#8208;NHC complex (4a,b&#8208;I) could indeed be obtained selectively. Overall, this study highlights a pioneering approach for the control of an equilibrium between different nuclearity metallo&#8208;supramolecular species engaging C&#8208;donor ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Surface Lattice On&#8208; (0&lt;n&lt;2) for Long&#8208;Term Durability of LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability of surface lattice On&#8208;&#160;(0&lt;n&lt;2) in the charged LiCoO&#8322;&#160;(LCO) limits its long&#8208;term cycling stability&#160;beyond 4.55 V vs. Li/Li&#8314;. Herein, the spinel and rock&#8208;salt (RS) phases are constructed on the&#160;LCO surface to stabilize lattice On&#8208;, namely S&#8208;LCO and R&#8208;LCO, respectively.&#160;Upon long&#8208;term cycling at 4.6 V, the loss of lattice On&#8208;&#160;leads to a progressive deterioration of surface spinel phase, which ultimately transfers to&#160;a strong Li+&#8208;blocking phase. In contrast,&#160;for R&#8208;LCO, the surface lattice On&#8208;&#160;in the&#160;RS phase&#160;retains stable in&#160;long&#8208;term cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that the migration barriers of lattice On&#8208;&#160;are significantly higher in the RS phase than that in the spinel&#160;phase. Due to the stabilized surface lattice On&#8208;, the R&#8208;LCO||Li cell shows a impressive capacity&#160;retention&#160;of&#160;78.6%&#160;in&#160;1000 cycles at 4.6 V (current of 1 C), and superior floating charge durability at 45&#8451;.&#160;This study highlights the importance of surface structure tailoring&#160;in developing the&#160;advanced LCO cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ruthenium(II) Complex Inhibits BRD4 for Synergistic Seno&#8208; and Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance is a significant challenge for tumor therapy. Activating immunity is an effective method to combat drug&#8208;resistant tumors. Utilizing metallic chemotherapeutic agents to induce non&#8208;apoptotic programmed cell death is a practical approach to stimulate immunity. Besides, triggering tumor cell senescence, named senotherapy, is also an effective but often ignored method to induce immune responses. Despite some progress, reports on metallic immunotherapeutic stimuli are sparse and mainly delve into the level of organelle targeting, with vague drug&#8211;target mechanisms. Here, we report a Ru(II) complex (Ru2c) inhibits BRD4 with high affinity at a nanomolar constant. After encapsulated in to biotin&#8208;DNA cage, Ru2@biotin&#8208;DNA cage was demonstrated to kill drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells through a synergistic apoptosis&#8208;ferroptosis&#8208;senescence pathway, exhibiting 51&#8208;fold anticancer activity compared to the commercial inhibitor JQ&#8208;1. Ru2c effectively erased drug&#8208;resistant tumors and activated innate and acquired immunity in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ru2c is the first metal&#8208;based BRD4 inhibitor to achieve synergistic seno&#8208;immunotherapy and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulation of Chemistry and Biology with Visible Light Using tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes and Azonium Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches are used for precise and reversible control over the properties and function of chemical, biological and material systems, offering exceptional spatiotemporal control. Their current development focuses on enabling operation with non&#8208;damaging and deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating visible/near&#8208;IR light. In this context, tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions play a leading role thanks to their unique photophysical properties and easily modifiable structure. However, it is only recently that synthetic approaches to those sterically demanding systems have been established and their structure&#8208;photochemistry relations have been understood to provide general rules for their tuning to a given application. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of this family of molecular photoswitches, providing an analysis of their photophysical properties, followed by a discussion of the available synthetic methodologies. Finally, we showcase the versatility of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and azonium ions for enabling light&#8208;control in biological and material sciences, providing multiple insights for future application.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; Revisited: The Surprisingly Stable Uncoordinated Pentaphospholide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of [2.2.2]cryptand to alkali metal heptaphosphides M3P7 (M = Na, K) leads to the formation of the salts [M([2.2.2]cryptand)][cyclo&#8208;P5]. Although the cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; anion is spectroscopically known since the 1980s it was so far prepared and handled only in solution. By complexing the alkali metal cation with [2.2.2]cryptand, the product was found to be surprisingly stable in the solid state. Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722;, which is isolobal to the well&#8208;known cyclopentadienide anion, was now characterized crystallographically for the first time. The structural elucidation proves its planar D5h symmetry, not only as ligand in different sandwich complexes but also in its uncoordinated form. Cyclo&#8208;P5&#8722; was further characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy in solution and in the solid&#8208;state by Raman and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT studies were performed to support the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmental atom probe tomography and multi&#8208;scale modeling reveal electric field effects in iron oxidation, as demonstrated by Sten V. Lambeets, Jean&#8208;Sabin McEwen et al. in their Research Article (e202423434). The inhomogeneous field on an iron tip (grey/black spheres) creates an uneven oxygen distribution. The field gradient, shown as an intensity grid, is strongest near the tip. Surface composition is probed upon exposure to oxygen (red spheres) by collecting emitted iron oxide cations, which are then compared to field&#8208;based oxidation calculations.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Straightforward Formation of Borirenes from Boroles and Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202423391), Felipe Fantuzzi, Eufr&#226;nio N. da Silva J&#250;nior, Holger Braunschweig et&#160;al. report a selective one&#8208;step synthesis of perarylated borirenes from boroles and 1,3&#8208;diynes. The study includes substrate scope, X&#8208;ray, and DFT analyses. The cover illustrates this process with a phenyl balloon carrying a borirene ring arising above a sky filled with borole precursors, highlighting the novelty and aromaticity of the three&#8208;membered boron&#8208;bearing rings (Cover design: Danilo Londo&#241;o).

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Accelerated Destruction of Passive Film and Microbial Corrosion of 316L Stainless Steel via Extracellular Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated microbial corrosion and destruction of passive films on stainless steel caused by electroactive Shewanella oneidensis biofilms are reported by Dake Xu et al in their Research Article (e202425220). The changes in surface properties were verified due to the accelerated electrochemical reactions mediated by extracellular electron transfer (EET). Cytochrome proteins and electron mediators accelerate EET process and redox reactions at the interface between electroactive bacterial biofilm and 316L stainless steel.

The present menace: Emissions of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8212;forever chemicals&#8212;represent a risk for the environment and human health. However, mitigation strategies lack. In their Minireview (e202424718), Patrick Lott, Florian Maurer, and Arik Beck discuss a roadmap on how to tackle PFAS emission in the gas phase using catalysis. Their cover art pays tribute to the iconic movie poster of the masterpiece Star Wars Episode 1, showing a CF4 molecule shadowing its past as long&#8208;chain PFAS onto a catalyst surface.

         <title>Double&#8208;Chain Copolymer Network via In Situ Polymerization Enables High&#8208;Stability and Lead&#8208;Safe Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive poly(amide ester) (PAE) with photosensitive properties was designed to construct a unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The vast network provides an effective defense to delay the degradation of devices and maximize the suppression of toxic lead leakage. The devices protected by the network achieved a champion efficiency of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%) with excellent stability and lead safety.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress due to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the long&#8208;term stability and lead toxicity of PSCs remain a huge challenge for further commercialization. Herein, we designed a multifunctional additive, poly(amide ester) (PAE), with photosensitive properties to overcome these difficulties. A unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network can be constructed via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional additive poly(amide ester) (PAE) with photosensitive properties was designed to construct a unique double-chain copolymer network via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The vast network provides an effective defense to delay the degradation of devices and maximize the suppression of toxic lead leakage. The devices protected by the network achieved a champion efficiency of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%) with excellent stability and lead safety.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress due to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the long-term stability and lead toxicity of PSCs remain a huge challenge for further commercialization. Herein, we designed a multifunctional additive, poly(amide ester) (PAE), with photosensitive properties to overcome these difficulties. A unique double-chain copolymer network can be constructed via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The multiple active sites in the polymer chains can passivate various defects and enhance charge transfer. Meanwhile, the vast network provides an effective defense for perovskite to stabilize the internal structure and resist harsh external environments, thus delaying the degradation of devices and maximizing the suppression of toxic lead leakage. Remarkably, the devices protected by the network achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%), the unencapsulated devices suppressed 80% of lead leakage, and the encapsulated devices maintained 93% of the initial PCE after 1000&#160;h in a humid and thermal environment (65&#160;&#176;C and 85% RH).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>La3+ Doped Nickel&#8208;Manganese Oxide as High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Guided by Bayesian Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The La3+ doped O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.5Cu0.06La0.05O2 cathode material has been successfully prepared guided by Bayesian optimization, which can realize the O3&#8208;P3&#8208;OP2 phase transition to induce negative lattice expansion during cycling. Besides, it delivers an excellent specific capacity attributed to the fact that La3+ doping can achieve the anionic redox during charge.







Abstract
In sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the layered transition metal oxides used as cathode often experience interlayer sliding of interlayer spacing and lattice variations during charge/discharge, leading to structural damage and capacity degradation. To address this challenge, a La3+ doping strategy guided by Bayesian optimization has been employed to prepare the high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.50Cu0.06La0.05O2 (NMCL) cathode material. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O&#160;2p orbital overlaps with the t2g orbital of transition metals in NMCL, facilitating the formation of Na&#8722;O&#8722;La bonds and promoting the oxygen redox reaction kinetics. During the Na+ (de)intercalation process, NMCL exhibits significant negative lattice expansion, characterized by an increase in the c lattice parameter and exceptionally low volume expansion of 1.8&#8201;% and 3.1&#8201;%, respectively. Consequently, it delivers an excellent specific capacity of 243.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V to 4.5&#8197;V, which can be attributed to La3+ doping that promotes oxidation of O2&#8722; to peroxide O2n&#8722; (n&lt;2) during charge.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation via Polycitric Acid&#8208;based Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence, that polycitric acid&#8208;based carbon nanodot (CND) can pose on the properties of incorporated N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores was investigated. Phenazine was used as the probe chromophore, because of its well&#8208;understood redox chemistry. Striking differences in spectral and electrochemical properties upon reduction between phenazine incorporated within CND (P&#8208;CND) and free phenazine were observed.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up syntheses of carbon nanodots (CND) using solvothermal treatment of citric acid are known to afford nanometer&#8208;sized, amorphous polycitric acid&#8208;based materials. The addition of suitable co&#8208;reactants in the form of in situ synthesized N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores facilitates hereby the overall functionalization. Reports regarding the influence of CND on the properties of, for example, N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores are scarce. Thus, our incentive was to design a CND model that features phenazine (P&#8208;CND) &#8211; a well&#8208;known N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore &#8211; to investigate the influence of the CND matrix on its redox chemistry as well as photochemistry. The scope of our work was to go beyond investigating the electrochemical properties of the resulting P&#8208;CND by shedding light onto differences relative to nano&#8208;aggregates of phenazine (PNZNA), which served as reference. In particular, chemical as well as electrochemical reduction of PNZNA initiated a reaction cascade that affords the primary reduction intermediate, that is, the reduced and protonated (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. In accordance with existing literature, the final product of a bimolecular disproportionation was 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine (PNZ&#8208;H2). Reducing P&#8208;CND also resulted in the formation of (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. But, no evidence for a subsequent bimolecular disproportionation was gathered. Instead, (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901; as an integrative part of P&#8208;CND was found to be actively involved in a H2 generation reaction. A more than twofold increase in efficiency compared to PNZNA under identical conditions was the consequence.

         <title>Conduction Band and Defect Engineering for the Prominent Visible&#8208;Light Responsive Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the stacking structure of the cationic 2D sheets enables the formation of the defect&#8208;tolerant bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum (CBM). The key is in the hybridization of empty Bi&#8208;6pz orbitals via the interlayer interaction of [Bi2O2]2+ slabs in Bi4NbO8Cl. Such a CBM is almost unaffected by anion vacancies, preventing the deep trapping of photogenerated electrons and maintaining them in reactive states. This property contributes significantly to enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of Bi4NbO8Cl by keeping photogenerated electrons available for surface reactions.







Abstract
Controlling trap depth is crucial to improve photocatalytic activity, but designing such crystal structures has been challenging. In this study, we discovered that in 2D materials like BiOCl and Bi4NbO8Cl, composed of interleaved [Bi2O2]2+ and Cl&#8208; slabs, the trap depth can be controlled by manipulating the slab stacking structure. In BiOCl, oxygen vacancies (VO) create deep electron traps, while chlorine vacancies (VCl) produce shallow traps. The depth is determined by the coordination around anion vacancies: VO forms strong &#963; bonds with Bi&#8208;6p dangling bonds below the conduction band minimum (CBM), while those around Cl are parallel, forming weak &#960;&#8208;bonding. The strong re&#8208;hybridization makes the trap depth deeper. In Bi4NbO8Cl, VCl also creates shallow traps, but VO does not produce deep traps although Bi&#8208;6p orbitals are also forming strong &#963; bonding. This difference is attributed to the difference of the energy level of CBM. In both cases, the CBM consists of Bi&#8208;6p orbitals extending into the Cl layers. However, these orbitals are isolated in BiOCl, but those in Bi4NbO8Cl are bonded with each other between neighboring [Bi2O2]2+ layers. This unique bonding&#8208;based CBM prevents the formation of deep electron traps, and significantly enhances H2 evolution activity by prolonging the lifetime of highly reactive free electrons.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two isoindigo&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG) were synthesized using a microwave&#8208;assisted method. By modulating core planarity, distinct morphological variations were achieved, with the highly crystalline, planar sheet&#8208;like I&#8208;TTA material standing out. This material exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting (OER and HER) reactions with low overpotential and promotes the potential of COFs in sustainable energy applications.







Abstract
Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG (I=Isoindigo, TTA=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)&#8208;trianiline, TG=triamino&#8208;guanidinium hydrochloride salt). By introducing two amine core units with different planarity, such as triazine and ionic guanidinium units, we control the morphology, crystallinity, and corresponding electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar two dimensional (2D) nanosheets covalent organic framework (COF), I&#8208;TTA whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (COP), I&#8208;TG with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134&#8197;mV for HER (in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4) and ~283&#8197;mV for OER (in 1&#8197;M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24&#8197;hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

         <title>Expanding Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam (PoTeM) Core Structure Diversity by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis and Bioengineering</title>

Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) derive from ornithine&#8208;based lysobacterene A. To expand the PoTeM core structure carbon skeleton by a CH2&#8208;unit, a synthetic access to lysobacterene A and an extended analog was developed, and cyclization by cognate ikarugamycin cyclases IkaBC was achieved in vitro. Building on these results, the adenylation domain of the NRPS IkaA was programmed to directly incorporate l&#8208;lysine, giving biotechnological access to the first backbone&#8208;engineered PoTeM, homo&#8208;ikarugamycin.







Abstract
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) represent a growing class of bioactive natural products that are derived from a common tetramate polyene precursor, lysobacterene A, produced by an unusual bacterial iterative polyketide synthase (PKS)/non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway&#8208;specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton do currently not exist. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural l&#8208;ornithine&#8208;derived building block by l&#8208;lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo&#8208;ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept l&#8208;lysine, which upon co&#8208;expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo&#8208;ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Fixation and Release Cycle Featuring a Trinuclear Zinc Complex for Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic fixation&#8208;release of dilute CO2 was carried out continuously in a system consisting of a zinc complex and an electrolytic cell with bipolar membrane. CO2 fixation is promoted by the formation of carbonate&#8208;coordinated complex, and CO2 release is induced by decomposition of the complex structure accompanied by protonation of the ligand. Reconstruction of the complex structure by ligand deprotonation closes the cycle to enable CO2 refixation.







Abstract
CO2 capture technology can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. CO2 capture driven by electrochemical reactions is attractive because the operation is carried out at normal temperature and pressure and involves a simple input system using electrical energy. Although promising metal complexes with high CO2 fixation performance have been reported, there are few studies on systems that combine electrochemical reactions and metal complexes. Here, we demonstrated stable CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycles using an electrochemical system with trinuclear Zn(II) complex (Zn3L) as the CO2 fixative and an ionic liquid as a supporting electrolyte for the stable operation. This system showed a faster CO2 fixation rate than that of an aqueous alkaline solution at the same concentration. Continuous release and refixation of CO2 were achieved by decomposition and reconstruction of the complex structure induced by H+ and OH&#8722; supplied from a bipolar membrane equipped in the electrolytic cell. The CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycle was demonstrated even for dilute CO2 (450&#8197;ppm) in air, where the CO2 capture rate reached approximately 46&#8201;% of CO2 contained in the air under an air flow condition of 200&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. This case, combining electrochemical drive and metal complexes, will provide a new option for CO2 capture technology.

         <title>Scalable and Low&#8208;Energy Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by a Seed&#8208;Mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthetic protocol has been developed under mild conditions. This allows MOF production at temperatures from room temperature to 50&#8201;&#176;C, producing highly crystalline structures with increased defects. These features result in a tenfold activity improvement in catalytic iodination. Additionally, the approach is scalable to gram&#8208;level production, demonstrating its potential toward practical applications.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by low energy input has been a long&#8208;term target for practical applications yet remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed a low&#8208;energy MOF growth strategy at a temperature down to 50&#8201;&#176;C by simply introducing seeds into the reaction system. The MOFs are continuously grown on the surface of the seeds at a growth rate dozens of times higher than that of conventional solvothermal synthesis at low temperature, while the resulting MOFs possess high crystallinity, porosity, and stability similar to solvothermal seeds. Remarkably, the obtained MOFs feature high&#8208;density structural defects with Lewis acidity, thereby displaying more than one order of magnitude higher activity than the MOFs obtained by the conventional solvothermal method in the iodination reaction of substituted arenes. This low&#8208;energy synthetic approach is readily scaled up, which would be a significant step forward in the dream of the MOF industry.

Inspired by natural photosynthesis system, we develop herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) architecture assembled by depositing (CNT) units as &#8220;artificial chlorophyll&#8221; on ordered ionic COF aerogel as reactors and transporters. The ASEC demonstrates a total solar energy conversion (SEC) value of 8047&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, corresponding to parallel production freshwater and H2O2 with rates of 3.56&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Efficient utilization of solar energy is widely regarded as a crucial solution to addressing the energy crisis and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Coupling photothermal and photochemical conversion can effectively improve solar energy utilization yet remains challenging. Here, inspired by the photosynthesis system in green plants, we report herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) composed of light&#8208;harvesting units as solar collector and oriented ionic hydrophilic channels as reactors and transporters. Based on such architecture, the obtained ASEC (namely ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1) can efficiently realize parallel production of freshwater and H2O2 from natural seawater under natural light. The total solar energy conversion (SEC) of ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 reaches up to 8047&#8197;kJ&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, corresponding to production rates of freshwater and H2O2 are 3.56&#8197;kg&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which is a record&#8208;high value among all photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems reported to date. Mechanism investigation of combining spectrum and experimental studies indicated that the high SEC performance for ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 was attributed to the presence of plant bioinspired architecture with carbon nanotubes as solar&#8208;harvestor and COF&#8208;based oriented aerogel as reactors and transporters. Our work thus establishes a novel artificial photosynthesis system for highly efficient solar energy utilization.

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes catalyse amide formation in an environmentally friendly manner. This study advances the application of ABS by integrating these enzymes with other compatible biocatalysts, creating enantioselective and scalable cascade reactions to produce valuable amide products from abundant nitrile precursors. Furthermore, two innovative methods for C&#8722;H bond amidation of aromatic compounds are introduced.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.

         <title>General and Versatile Nanoarchitectonics for Amino Acid&#8208;Based Glasses via Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Counterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy has been developed to controllably synthesize amino acid&#8208;based glasses featuring customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable optical properties. This approach addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge of vitrifying small molecules with a strong crystallization tendency, opening avenues for the development of functional supramolecular glasses.







Abstract
Amino acid&#8208;based biomolecular glasses represent an emerging material to meet the demand for sustainable development. However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid&#8208;based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co&#8208;assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long&#8208;persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes. This work presents an effective approach for the synthesis of amino acid&#8208;based glasses and provides insights into the development of supramolecular glasses with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Multicomponent Polymerization toward Poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s as Unique SO2 Generators for Sonodynamic and Gas Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent polymerization strategy utilizing bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was successfully developed, leading to the synthesis of a library of structurally diverse poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimides), which were then converted to the corresponding poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide) polymers. The unique ultrasound&#8208;induced SO2&#8208;releasing ability of these polymers together with their ability to generate reactive oxygen species endow them as excellent therapeutic agents for combined sonodynamic and gas therapy against cancer.







Abstract
In this work, a multicomponent polymerization (MCP) approach involving bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was developed to afford a library of poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimide)s (PPSIs) in high yields and molecular weights, which were further modified to form unique sulfur dioxide (SO2) generators. Bipyrroles served as carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles to undergo Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C coupling during the MCP. Upon post&#8208;MCP modification by transforming the bipyrrole unit to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and the sulfonylimide moiety to sulfonamide, poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s (PBSAs) were obtained as potent anticancer therapeutic agents. This study disclosed the decomposition and SO2&#8208;releasing ability of PBSAs under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Furthermore, one of these polymers having a reactive oxygen species&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker was modified with triethylene glycol chains to give PBSA&#8208;EG, which was further studied for in vitro and in vivo US&#8208;induced anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Upon tail veil administration of PBSA&#8208;EG nanoparticles into tumor&#8208;bearing mice followed by US irradiation, remarkable tumor suppression was observed. This study demonstrates that the innovative and efficient MCP method can construct polymers bearing the BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide moieties, which show a great potential as safe and potent materials for combined gas and sonodynamic therapy against cancer.

We report herein a glyoxal&#8208;based, arginine&#8208;reactive strategy to generate potent and selective small&#8208;molecule Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) of Mcl&#8208;1 (an important anti&#8208;apoptotic protein), Aurora A (a cancer&#8208;related kinase). We showed the resulting compounds were potent, selective and cell&#8208;active with long residence time. We further showed this glyoxal&#8208;based TCI strategy in targeting an acquired drug&#8208;resistance mutant of ALK kinase (G1202R).







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) play an essential role in the fields of kinase research and drug discovery. TCI strategies to target more common amino acid side&#8208;chains have yet to be demonstrated. Targeting other amino acids would also expand the pharmaceutical industry&#8216;s toolbox for targeting other tough&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. We report herein a glyoxal&#8208;based, arginine&#8208;reactive strategy to generate potent and selective small&#8208;molecule TCIs of Mcl&#8208;1 (an important anti&#8208;apoptotic protein) by selectively targeting the conserved arginine (R263) in the protein. We further validated the generality of this strategy by developing glyoxal&#8208;based, irreversible covalent inhibitors of AURKA (a cancer&#8208;related kinase) that showed exclusive reactivity with a solvent&#8208;exposed arginine (R220) of this enzyme. We showed the resulting compounds were potent, selective and cell&#8208;active, capable of covalently engaging endogenous AURKA in MV&#8208;4&#8211;11&#8197;cells with long residence time. Finally, we showed the potential application of glyoxal&#8208;based TCIs in targeting an acquired drug&#8208;resistance mutant of ALK kinase (G1202R).

         <title>Multiple Near&#8208;Infrared Chromisms of a Heteromerous Overcrowded Ethylene with Large Permanent Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion and electron&#8208;accepting cation shows multiple NIR chromisms accompanying the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers. The weak interaction between the anion and cation moieties in the twisted conformer is crucial for multiple NIR chromisms.







Abstract
An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion, naphthoxide, and electron&#8208;accepting cation, acridinium, has been synthesized. It is in equilibrium between a folded conformer having a smaller permanent dipole moment with visible light absorption and a twisted conformer having a larger permanent dipole moment with NIR light absorption. The overcrowded ethylene shows multiple NIR chromisms, such as solvatochromism, thermochromism, mechanochromism, vapochromism, halochromism, and amphoteric electrochromisms, which are caused by the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers or by controlling the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor moiety and the LUMO of the acceptor moiety. The small difference between the HOMO energy level of naphthoxide moiety and the LUMO energy level of acridinium moiety, and their weak interaction are crucial for NIR absorption and large dipole moment in the twisted conformer. The drastic change in the ratio of folded and twisted conformers by changing the polarity of solvents, the detection of CO2, and the disappearance of NIR absorption by electrochemical oxidation and reduction are noteworthy for this new type of organic dye.

         <title>Isolation and Structure Elucidation of the Heterocumulene Anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; (L=CO, CS, N2)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cumulated 5&#8208;atomic cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and thioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722; were synthesized from the metalated ylide and ketenyl anion, respectively. Both anions exhibit unexpected stability, but with notable structural differences. While the cyanodiazomethanide features a distinctly bent geometry, the thioketenyl anion was found to be linear, which can be explained by to the stronger &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the CS ligand.







Abstract
Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8722; anion was sufficiently stable at 0&#8201;&#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.

         <title>Mastering the Copolymerization Behavior of Ethyl Cyanoacrylate as Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;metal Battery Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a facile approach to achieve efficient and controllable copolymerization behaviour of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, affording mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolytes for high voltage and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano&#8208;containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual&#8208;lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high&#8208;ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA&#8208;based copolymers. The mechanically robust polymer network made by the ECA copolymer enables LMBs with both LFP cathodes and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes (4.5&#8197;V) operatable at different temperatures with ultra&#8208;long cycle life at 1&#8197;C (capacity retention of 81.1&#8201;% and 83.8&#8201;%, respectively, over 1000 cycles).

         <title>A Malleable Collagen&#8208;Mimic that Undergoes Moisture&#8208;Induced Hardening for Gluing Hydrophilic Surfaces</title>

A designed tripeptide, which organizes in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner as supramolecular helices in its crystal, undergoes a regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a malleable and mouldable protein&#8208;mimic. This biocompatible collagen&#8208;mimic undergoes moisture induced hardening and glues both biological specimens and synthetic materials, making it an attractive bioadhesive.







Abstract
A collagen&#8208;inspired helical protein&#8208;mimic has been synthesized via topochemical polymerization of a designed tripeptide monomer. In the monomer crystal, molecules arrange in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, forming supramolecular helices. The azide and alkyne of adjacent molecules in the supramolecular helix are proximally preorganized in a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement. On heating, the monomer crystals undergo regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding triazolyl&#8208; polypeptide. Polymerization softens the crystals, making the polymer malleable and mouldable. The polymer grains absorb moisture and form agglomerates through water&#8208;bridged adhesion, which hardens over time. The weight&#8208;bearing capacity of a mould made from this polymer increased by 50&#8208;fold due to moisture&#8208;induced hardening. We have demonstrated that this collagen&#8208;mimic can glue both biological specimens such as wood and bone and synthetic materials such as glass and paper.

     alt="A Malleable Collagen-Mimic that Undergoes Moisture-Induced Hardening for Gluing Hydrophilic Surfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A designed tripeptide, which organizes in a head-to-tail manner as supramolecular helices in its crystal, undergoes a regiospecific single-crystal-to-single-crystal azide-alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a malleable and mouldable protein-mimic. This biocompatible collagen-mimic undergoes moisture induced hardening and glues both biological specimens and synthetic materials, making it an attractive bioadhesive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collagen-inspired helical protein-mimic has been synthesized via topochemical polymerization of a designed tripeptide monomer. In the monomer crystal, molecules arrange in a head-to-tail manner, forming supramolecular helices. The azide and alkyne of adjacent molecules in the supramolecular helix are proximally preorganized in a ready-to-react arrangement. On heating, the monomer crystals undergo regiospecific single-crystal-to-single-crystal azide-alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding triazolyl- polypeptide. Polymerization softens the crystals, making the polymer malleable and mouldable. The polymer grains absorb moisture and form agglomerates through water-bridged adhesion, which hardens over time. The weight-bearing capacity of a mould made from this polymer increased by 50-fold due to moisture-induced hardening. We have demonstrated that this collagen-mimic can glue both biological specimens such as wood and bone and synthetic materials such as glass and paper. In vitro studies established the biocompatibility, making it an attractive bioinspired material for potential application as a bioadhesive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Supporting Flexible Electrode for Tracking and Reversible Quantification of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the Brains of Freely Behaving Animal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with suitable bending stiffness for self&#8208;supporting brain implantation, low Young's modulus, high biocompatibility, and minimal position shifts. Using DFT calculation, we designed Mg2+ and Ca2+ ligands, creating sensors with excellent selectivity, reversibility, and response time, enabling in vivo recording for 90&#8197;days. Our findings revealed Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx and changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ aligned with neural pathways during seizures.







Abstract
Monitoring dynamic neurochemical signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving animals remains great challenging in biocompatibility and direct implantation capability of current electrodes. Here we created a self&#8208;supporting polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with sufficient bending stiffness for direct brain implantation without extra devices, but demonstrating low Young's modulus with remarkable biocompatibility and minimal position shifts. Meanwhile, screening by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we designed and synthesized specific ligands targeting Mg2+ and Ca2+, and constructed Mg&#8722;E and Ca&#8722;E sensors with high selectivity, good reversibility, and fast response time, successfully monitoring Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vivo up to 90&#8197;days. Using this powerful tool, we discovered for the first time that, during the 4&#8208;aminopyridine&#8208;induced seizure in the live brain, extracellular Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx. Moreover, the timing of initial changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels during seizures aligned with neural pathways, which had not been previously reported.

         <title>Amide&#8208;Directed Highly Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Diverse Acyclic Multisubstituted Alkenes Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed amide&#8208;directed highly enantioselective hydrogenation of acyclic multisubstituted alkenes has been developed. This general catalyst enables enantioselective hydrogenation of a diverse range of alkenes containing 3&#8211;4 alkyl substituents under mild conditions, delivering compounds with contiguous tertiary chiral centers in high yields with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted alkenes to form 1,2&#8208;contiguous stereocenters is a particularly appealing but highly challenging transformation in asymmetric catalysis. Despite the notable progress achieved in enantioselective hydrogenation over the past decades, enantioselective hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes containing multiple alkyl groups remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of diverse acyclic multisubstituted alkenes under mild conditions. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center generates a highly active catalyst that effectively overcomes the low reactivity of substrates and precisely controls the stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalyst system is exemplified by its efficacy across at least three types of alkenes including &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, and enamides.

         <title>An Anionic Mesoionic Carbene (anMIC) and its Transformation to Metallo MIC&#8208;Boranes: Synthesis and Properties</title>

The first general synthesis of triazole&#8208;based anionic mesoionic carbene and their follow&#8208;up chemistry are presented.







Abstract
Neutral mesoionic carbenes (MICs) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core have had a strong impact on various branches of chemistry such as homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photochemistry/photophysics. We present here the first general synthesis of anionic mesoionic carbenes (anMICs, 2) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core and a borate backbone. The free anMIC is stable in solution under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures, and can be stored for several weeks. Analysis of donor properties shows that these anMICs are extremely strong &#963;&#8208;donors, bypassing the donor properties of strong donors such as MICs, NHCs, anionic NHCs and N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The room temperature conversion of the free anMICs leads to three equally interesting compound classes: an amide&#8208;coordinated borane based on a MIC&#8208;borane backbone (2BR3), a polymeric triazolide (1Li) and an amide&#8208;coordinated metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane. The metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane (3Li) is an interesting precursor for the synthesis of further amide&#8208;coordinated MIC&#8208;borane compounds. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of transformation of the anMICs. We thus introduce three new categories of mesoionic compounds here with potential for different branches of chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Reductive Carbon Materials: Tailoring Chemistry and Electronic Properties to Improve Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ketenes are electron&#8208;rich and highly reactive molecules that are widely used in organic chemistry. Here, electron&#8208;rich ketenes are used to synthesize reductive carbon materials, which are carbon materials with work function lower than that of graphite. By designing ketene&#8208;derivative precursors we can tailor the chemical and electronic properties of the reductive carbons. Furthermore, it is shown that the materials&#8217; work function impacts the plateau capacity of the negative electrode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The development of versatile strategies for preparing functional carbon materials is essential for advancing a wide range of applications in materials science. Precursor design plays a pivotal role in governing the chemistry and structure of carbon materials for target applications. In this work, we report the synthesis of Meldrum's acid derivatives through Knoevenagel condensation with aromatic heterocycles such as pyrrole, furan, and thiophene, which serve as precursors for carbonaceous materials with tailored chemical and electronic properties. The thermal condensation of these precursors proceeds via highly reactive, electron&#8208;rich ketene intermediates, playing a crucial role in the formation of the carbon materials. The resulting heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials exhibit tunable chemical, physico&#8208;chemical, and structural properties, which we have correlated with their energy storage performances. Eventually, we deem this strategy of high interest for designing high&#8208;performance carbonaceous materials with tunable properties for a broad range of applications, from electrochemical energy storage to conversion, water filtration, environmental remediation, and beyond.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides Mediated by the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;53(Cr)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a flexible &#8220;breathing&#8221; metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Structural flexibility, driven by the interactions of the MOF with the solvent and substrate, tunes the pore apertures and enhances catalytic efficiency. This study unveils MIL&#8208;53(Cr)&#8242;s dynamic framework reconfiguration, highlighting its potential as a tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking photocatalyst for sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
The catalytic potential of flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored, particularly in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. This study employs MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a prototypical &#8220;breathing&#8221; MOF capable of structural adaptation via pore size modulation, as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pair Distribution Function analyses reveal that organic solvents influence pore opening, while substrates and products dynamically adjust the framework configuration during catalysis. This structural flexibility enables precise tuning of photocatalytic efficiency via solvent&#8208;mediated control of the pore aperture. The results demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of MIL&#8208;53(Cr) facilitates enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, advancing the application of flexible MOFs as tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts. These findings pave the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation flexible photocatalysts.

         <title>On the Role of Hydrogen Migrations in the Taxadiene System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long range proton migrations are known to play a role in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. This study demonstrates the involvement of long distance hydrogen transfers also in the mass spectrometric fragmentation, and combined approaches through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and enzymatic conversion of designed substrate analogs give detailed insights into their involvement in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene and related compounds.







Abstract
Taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene is made by the taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene synthase (TxS) from Taxus brevifolia. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer Enables Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Seawater Splitting for Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production</title>

A zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer design by integrating the cation exchange membrane (CEM) and bipolar membrane (BPM) assemblies for supporting electrolyte&#8208;free DSS without compromises in operation durability and efficiency.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;assisted direct seawater splitting (DSS) technologies are actively studied as a promising route to produce green hydrogen (H2), whereas the indispensable use of supporting electrolytes that help to extract water and provide electrochemically&#8208;accelerated reaction media results in a severe energy penalty, consuming up to 12.5&#8201;% of energy input when using a typical KOH electrolyte. We bypass this issue by designing a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer configuration based on the integration of cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane assemblies, which protects stable DSS operation against the precipitates and corrosion in the absence of additional supporting electrolytes. The heterolytic water dissociation function of the bipolar membrane in&#8197;situ creates an asymmetric acidic&#8208;alkaline environment, kinetically facilitating H2 and O2 evolution reactions. When working in natural seawater without any chemical inputs, this zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer sustains nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward H2 for 120&#8197;h at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With the high&#8208;integrity merit, our electrolyzer can be facilely scaled up into practical cell stacks with significantly increased active area and promising prospects for volume/space&#8208;sensitive application scenarios. This electrolyzer concept opens an underexplored design space for energy&#8208;saving H2 production from low&#8208;grade saline water sources, being complementary to, and potentially competitive with the pre&#8208;purification Schemes.

         <title>Formamidine as an Easy&#8208;On and Easy&#8208;Off Linker for Reversible Crosslinking of Two Alkyl Amines in Peptide Stapling and Conjugation</title>

         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative condensation with glyoxylic acid enables facile crosslinking of two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, facilitating peptide macrocyclization and biomolecule conjugation. This linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral and acidic conditions but can be readily cleaved under mild conditions with ethylenediamine or hydrazine in alcohol or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups.







Abstract
Amino groups are abundant in both natural and synthetic molecules, offering highly accessible sites for modifying native biorelevant molecules. Despite significant progress with more reactive thiol groups, methods for ligating two amino groups with reversible linkers for bioconjugation applications remain elusive. Herein, we report the use of oxidative decarboxylative condensation of glyoxylic acid to crosslink or ligate two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, applicable in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular contexts. This linking chemistry exhibits unique hetero&#8208;coupling selectivity between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Although the formamidine linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral buffers and acidic conditions, it can be readily cleaved with ethylenediamine or hydrazine under mild conditions in alcohol solvents or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups. This study introduces a rare &#8216;easy&#8208;on and easy&#8208;off&#8217; strategy for connecting two native amines in peptide stapling and biomolecule conjugation.

         <title>Competitive Coordination and Dual Interphase Regulation of MOF&#8208;Modified Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a MOF&#8208;Modified PEO&#8208;based SPEs for sodium metal batteries. Benefitting from the competitive coordination with PEO and TFSI&#8722; anions, the open metal sites (OMS) of Cu&#8208;MOF effectively weaken Na+&#8722;O bonds and facilitate Na+ migration. More importantly, the formed NaF/Na3N&#8208;rich CEI/SEI layers contribute to realize dual interphase regulation.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as prominent candidates for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their enhanced flexibility and reduced interfacial resistance. However, their performance is limited by poor Na+ conductivity at room temperature, disordered ion transport properties and unstable interfaces. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu&#8208;MOF compete with Na+, effectively coordinating with TFSI&#8722; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na+&#8722;O binding strength and facilitating Na+ migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu&#8208;MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a high Na+ transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&#8722; anions by Cu&#8208;MOF promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich (NaF and Na3N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na+ coordination state and interphase engineering in solid&#8208;state SMBs.

Benefitting from the competitive coordination with PEO and TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, the open metal sites (OMS) of Cu-MOF effectively weaken Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O bonds and facilitate Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration. More importantly, the formed NaF/Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N-rich CEI/SEI layers contribute to realize dual interphase regulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as prominent candidates for solid-state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their enhanced flexibility and reduced interfacial resistance. However, their performance is limited by poor Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity at room temperature, disordered ion transport properties and unstable interfaces. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu-MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu-MOF compete with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, effectively coordinating with TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O binding strength and facilitating Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu-MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a high Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions by Cu-MOF promotes the formation of inorganic-rich (NaF and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination state and interphase engineering in solid-state SMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discrete Hybrid Vanadium&#8208;oxo Cluster as a Targeted Tool for Selective Protein Oxidative Modifications and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid vanadium&#8208;oxo cluster selectively binds to hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and facilitates localized oxidation in the vicinity of its binding site. These modifications occur under physiological conditions through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. This innovative approach highlights the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters for precise, targeted protein modification.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modification on protein structure and functions is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to combat macromolecular damage and cell death. However, selectively inducing oxidative modifications in proteins under physiological conditions remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate that [V6O13{(OCH2)3CCH2OH}2]2&#8722; (V6&#8208;OH) hybrid metal&#8208;oxo cluster can be used for selective protein oxidative cleavage and modifications. We present the first example of a protein&#8208;bound hybrid vanadate cluster, where its interactions with protein surfaces and the redox activity of vanadium enable selective oxidative modifications. Single Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) of the V6&#8208;OH and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) complex revealed that the binding is dictated both by the inorganic core and the organic ligands attached to it. Selective oxidation or cleavage of HEWL occurs under physiological conditions by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. The outcome of the oxidative reaction can be tuned by varying the concentration of V6&#8208;OH to result either in selective oxidation of the amino acid side chains or peptide bond cleavage. LC&#8211;MS and crystallography revealed that oxidative modifications were mainly concentrated near the cluster binding sites, providing spatial control of ROS production. This study advances our understanding of vanadium's role in biological systems and demonstrates the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters in protein modification.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Localization Transfer Regulation in 3D COFs Enhances Photocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [8+4] 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were developed and applied to photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation for the first time, which expanded the scope of application of 3D COFs and provided new insight into the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts.







Abstract
In this work, a series of new crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on [8+4] construction was designed and successfully realized efficient photocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4). By regulating the hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer effect in these 3D COFs, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;H containing cobalt glyoximate active centers exhibited excellent C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 performance, with an average C2H4 yield of 1755.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure C2H2, also showed near 100&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 in 1&#8201;% C2H2 contained crude C2H4 mixtures (industry&#8208;relevant conditions), and finally obtain polymer grade C2H4. In contrast, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;BF2 only showed one fifth activity due to lack of hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer. The density functional theory (DFT), projected density of states (PDOS) and molecular dynamics &#8220;slow&#8208;growth&#8221; kinetic calculations based on precise 3D COF structures confirmed that the rapid hydrogen species transfer, enhanced water dissociation and suitable C2H2 adsorption in COFs jointly contributed efficient photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH). This work provides new opportunity towards rational design and development of crystalline photocatalysts for C2H2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline&#8208;Free Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid using Electrochemically&#8208;Charged NixCo1&#8208;x(OH)2 as a Redox Mediator</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel cobalt hydroxide serves as an effective redox medium, which decomposes the traditional oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into independent production processes of hydrogen (H2) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). This approach addresses the challenges associated with employing strong alkalis in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural and eliminates the necessity for a membrane. The introduction of a moderate amount of Co significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of the substrate, facilitating the efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the yield and selectivity of the product FDCA nearing 100&#8201;%. This base&#8208;free and membrane&#8208;free system demonstrates the promising scalability and broad applicability for sustainable chemical and energy production.







Abstract
Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100&#8201;%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92&#8201;% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous copper nanoplates were prepared by a facile epitaxial growth strategy with the thiol&#8208;functional surfactant as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled template. The product featured oxidated Cu+ sites around mesopores, which stabilized active hydrogen radicals and facilitated transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction for selective alkene electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic transfer alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with H2O as hydrogen source is industrially promising for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added alkenes while inhibiting byproduct alkanes. Although great achievements, their development has remarkably restricted by designing atomically sophisticated electrocatalysts. Here, we reported single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous copper nanoplates (meso&#8208;Cu PLs) as a robust yet highly efficient electrocatalyst for selective alkene electrosynthesis from transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkyne in H2O. Anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs were prepared through a facile epitaxial growth strategy with functional C22H45N(CH3)2&#8208;C3H6&#8208;SH as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled surfactant. Different to nonporous Cu counterparts with flat surface, meso&#8208;Cu PLs with spherical mesopores exposed abundant Cu+ sites, which not only stabilized active H* radicals from electrocatalytic H2O splitting without coupling into molecular H2 but also accelerated kinetically the desorption of semi&#8208;hydrogenated alkenes. With 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (4&#8208;AP) as the substrate, anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs delivered superior electrocatalytic transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation performance with up to 99&#8201;% of 4&#8208;aminostyrene selectivity and 100&#8201;% of 4&#8208;AP conversion as well as good cycle stability. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;Cu PLs were electrocatalytically applicable for transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation of various alkynes. This work thus paved an alternative paradigm for designing robust mesoporous metal electrocatalysts with structurally functional metal sites applied in the selective electrosynthesis of industrially value&#8208;added chemicals in H2O.

         <title>Efficient and Robust Europium(III)&#8208;Based Hybrid Lanthanide Scintillators for Advanced X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current X&#8208;ray scintillators face challenges in efficiency, stability, and flexibility for advanced imaging applications. In this study, we introduce Europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators, integrated with flexible and transparent polymer matrices, offering high radioluminescence, excellent stability, and sensitivity, enabling high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with superior image quality.







Abstract
Scintillators that convert ionizing radiation into low&#8208;energy photons are essential for medical diagnostics and industrial inspections. Despite advances in X&#8208;ray scintillators, challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, environmental compatibility, stability, and flexibility. Here, we present experimental investigations of a new type of europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators for improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between dual organic ligands and lanthanide ions, the Eu(TTA)3Phen complex demonstrates exceptional radioluminescence and light yield under X&#8208;ray excitation, with a detection limit of 19.97&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, well below typical radiation doses used in medical diagnostics. Moreover, lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3Phen exhibited excellent thermal and photostability, showing minimal degradation even after extended X&#8208;ray exposure. By integrating with flexible polymer matrices, a high&#8208;transmission Eu(TTA)3Phen&#8208;PMMA composite film was fabricated for X&#8208;ray radiography, demonstrating high spatial resolution (&lt;10&#8197;um) and superior image quality across various target samples. These findings hold substantial promise for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging applications, offering high sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and versatility, making them ideally suited for advanced radiographic systems.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO on Ni&#8208;Based Cationic Polymer with TiO2&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation and Stabilization</title>

         <dc:description>
We present an in situ photocatalytic exfoliation strategy to obtain TiO2/NiIP nanosheets with more accessible active sites, shorten electron transport pathways, and favorable key intermediate adsorption, resulting in the high CO production as 54.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivity of 99.9&#8201;%. This work presents a new pathway to acquire efficient and stable porous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers have shown great potential in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their unique tunable structure favoring gas adsorption and metal sites integration. However, efficient photocatalysis in porous polymers is greatly limited by the low surface reactivity and electron mobility of bulk structure. Herein, we incorporate TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni(II) sites into a layered cationic imidazolium polymer (IP), in which the imidazolium moieties and free anions can stabilize the key intermediates and enhance the reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction. During the photocatalytic reaction, the layered TiO2/NiIP is in situ exfoliated to nanosheets (NSs) with more accessible active sites and shorten electron transport pathways. The formed TiO2/NiIP&#8208;NSs exhibit an impressively high CO production rate as 54.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivity of 99.9&#8201;%. The embedding with TiO2 nanoparticles could improve the electron transport efficiency so as to facilitate the photochemical stripping process of layered polymer. Moreover, the exfoliated nanosheets with assistance of TiO2 possess excellent stability during the recycling experiments in comparison to the rapidly declined activity of NiIP&#8208;NSs. This work presents a new strategy to construct highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Metal&#8208;Organic Layer on Polyoxometalate&#8208;etching Cu2O to Boost CO2 Reduction with High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
POM&#8208;etching for in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic layer can simultaneously incorporate electron sponge and protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites exhibit exceptional robustness and achieve efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH with a yield 55 times higher than that of binary Cu2O@HKUST.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM=PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt;x&#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60&#8197;h without noticeable activity loss.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Vinylene&#8208;linked 3D Covalent Organic Framework with Unprecedented cya Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cya topological COF was synthesized through the vinylene linkage between saddle porphyrin units and triazine units. This innovative integration of light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin unit, vinylene&#8208;linked conjugated framework, and incorporation of tetrathiafulvalene guests substantially enhanced H2O2 production.







Abstract
Designing and realizing new topologies represent one of the most important ways toward developing new structures and functionalities for molecule&#8208;based frameworks including SOFs, MOFs, and COFs. Herein, Aldol condensation between 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl(tetrakis(([1,1&#8242;:3&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)))&#8208;porphyrin (TTEP) and 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) affords the vinylene&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic framework Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) in combination with structural simulation reveals its high crystalline structure with an unprecedented cya topology in the molecule&#8208;based frameworks reported thus far. Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya displayed polycrystallinity and possessed high permanent porosity. Especially, the incorporation of light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin unit and vinylene linkages in Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya enables a conjugation effect within the framework, endowing it with a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 2209&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 in pure aqueous solution under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm). Inclusion of the guest molecules TTF into the pores of Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya results in a donor&#8208;acceptor system TTF@Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya, enhancing the photocatalytic activity with H2O2 production rate of 6994&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1. This work paves a new way for the development of new topological functional molecule&#8208;based frameworks toward diverse application potentials.

         <title>Ultrastable Imidazole&#8208;linked Porous Organic Cages for Ammonia Capture and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot synthesis has been developed for a new class of porous organic cages (POCs) with imidazole linkages, which exhibit remarkable chemical stability in harsh environments, including strong acidic and alkaline solutions, rendering them promising candidates for ammonia capture and detection.







Abstract
Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern&#8208;like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl&#8208;functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o&#8208;phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, IPOC&#8208;2 and IPOC&#8208;4 display a remarkable NH3 capturing capability, with uptakes of up to 11.5&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, surpassing most reported porous organic materials. Additionally, IPOC&#8208;1 exhibits highly efficient fluorescent quenching sensing of aqueous NH3, with a detection limit as low as 3.35&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M. These findings strongly suggest the potential for widespread use of imidazole linkages in the development of robust functional porous organic cage materials for diverse applications.

         <title>Heteroarchitectural Gas Diffusion Layer Promotes CO2 Reduction Coupled with Biomass Oxidation at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiB2&#8208;Ag&#8208;PTFE heteroarchitectural gas diffusion layer (GDL) is developed for CO2 electrolyzer. Such GDL possesses good conductivity, strong hydrophobicity, high chemical stability, and compatibility with various catalysts and electrolytes. Coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid are achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Achieving high product selectivity at ampere&#8208;level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 6&#8197;M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations and in situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2&#8208;supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere&#8208;level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack&#8208;level devices.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Superstructures with Circularly Polarized Photolumines&#8208;Cence Obtained by the Self&#8208;Assembly and Annealing of Nanoclusters</title>

We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters, followed by annealing.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with strongly circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters on a substrate, followed by their annealing. In the first step, the nanoclusters self&#8208;assemble upon solvent evaporation, a process that forms mesoscopic superstructures whose geometrical arrangement at the &#956;m&#8208;scale confers them optical chirality. In the second step, mild annealing of such superstructures induces the coalescence of the nanoclusters, accompanied by a continuous red shift of the photoluminescence up to 530&#8197;nm, with preservation of the &#956;m&#8208;scale wires bundles and the chiral properties of the sample (glum=0.1). The successful chirality transfer from the initial nanoclusters assemblies to these final CsPbBr3 superstructures provides a convenient way to obtain circularly polarized emitters.

The successful chirality transfer from the initial nanoclusters assemblies to these final CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; superstructures provides a convenient way to obtain circularly polarized emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Extended Bipolar Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208; and threefold&#8208;fused bipolar dyes based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide and various electron&#8208;rich motifs were synthesized by a facile and efficient cascade process with cesium carbonate. These polyaromatic systems could not be obtained by transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
The development of straightforward synthetic methods for photoactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that avoid Pd&#8208;catalyzed or radical&#8208;based processes remains a challenge. Such methods are essential to reducing the cost and environmental impact of organic photodevices. In this work, we present a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for creating novel bipolar PAHs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which are not accessible via conventional Pd&#8208;catalyzed routes. Our cascade process operates exclusively under basic conditions, utilizing cesium carbonate and molecular sieves to facilitate the coupling of electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;fluoronaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide with halogenated electron&#8208;rich moieties. This results in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective formation of new 6&#8208; and/or 5&#8208;membered conjugated rings via consecutive SNAr reactions, as confirmed through experimental and computational studies. The resulting PAHs exhibit strong emissive properties, with quantum yields ranging from 34&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. This work provides a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for producing novel semiconducting materials, offering a new framework for designing bipolar PAHs with distinct optical characteristics.

         <title>Tailoring Water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;stable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO electrolyte was proposed to achieve stable Zn anodes and cathodes. The Zn2+ solvation structure composed of DMSO and BF4&#8722; leads to the formation of the Zn2+&#8208;conducting SEIs and superior stability of Zn anode. Simultaneously, the water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO solvent environment reduces deleterious proton insertion, enhancing the stability of VO2 cathode.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs) are hindered by two primary challenges: instability of Zn anode and deterioration of the cathode structure in traditional aqueous electrolytes, largely attributable to the decomposition of active H2O. Here, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;flammable water&#8208;in&#8208;dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte to address these issues. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ techniques and computational simulations demonstrate that the activity of H2O in this electrolyte is extremely compressed, which not only suppresses the side reactions and increases the reversibility of Zn anode, but also diminishes the cathode dissolution and proton intercalation. The hybrid solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), formed in situ, helps Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cell a prolonged lifespan exceeding 10000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 600&#8197;h at a 60&#8201;% discharge depth. The versatility of this electrolyte endows the Zn&#8208;VO2 full batteries ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance. This work provides insights into electrolyte structure&#8211;property relationships, and facilitates the design of high&#8208;performance RZBs.

         <title>1.5D Chiral Perovskites Mediated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network with Remarkable Spin&#8208;Polarized Property</title>

New 1.5D chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, feature a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag 1D inorganic chains forming a layered architecture. They exhibit long spin lifetimes, stable spin polarization retention, and a remarkable CISS effect with maximum spin polarization degrees of 92&#8201;%&#8211;94&#8201;%, highlighting their potential for spintronics and the vital role of chemical environment in sculpturing spin property of chiral perovskites.







Abstract
In this study, we developed new chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, by incorporating achiral guanidinium (GA+) and chiral R/S&#8208;methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA+) into the perovskite framework. The resulting materials possess a distinctive structural configuration, positioned between 1D and 2D perovskites, which we describe as 1.5D. This structure is featured by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag inorganic chains, further forming an organized layered architecture. The structural dimensionality affects both electronic and spin&#8208;related properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal Rashba splitting induced by the inversion asymmetry of the crystal structure, while circularly polarized transient absorption spectroscopy confirms spin lifetime on the nanosecond timescale. Magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (mCP&#8208;AFM) measurements demonstrate exceptional chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) with maximum spin polarization degrees of (92&#177;1)% and (&#8722;94&#177;2)% for (R&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 and (S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, also highlight the critical role of chemical environment in sculpturing the structural dimension and spin&#8208;polarized property of chiral perovskites.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Symmetry Copper Benzenehexathiol Coordination Polymer with In&#8208;Plane Electrical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrically conductive coordination polymer, Cu5BHT, featuring a low&#8208;symmetry structure, is synthesized on the water surface. We demonstrate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal directions.







Abstract
Electrically conductive coordination polymers (ECCPs), particularly those incorporating benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligands, are emerging as a distinctive class of electronic materials with tunable semiconducting and metallic properties. However, the exploration of novel ECCPs with low&#8208;symmetry structures and electrical anisotropy remains under development. Here, we report the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of a novel ECCP, namely Cu5BHT, which exhibits a low&#8208;symmetry structure and unique in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy that differs from the well&#8208;known Cu3BHT phase. Utilizing imaging and diffraction techniques, we elucidate the unit cell and crystal structure of Cu5BHT, revealing an asymmetric arrangement of the kagome resembling lattice connected by two different secondary building units: square planar CuS4 and non&#8208;planar Cu2S4. Theoretical studies indicate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal direction. Single&#8208;crystal electrical measurements confirm a metallic character characterized by the increase of conductance upon cooling. Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the ab plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low&#8208;symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy.

Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low-symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in-plane electrical anisotropy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Establishing the Link Between Oxygen Vacancy and Activity Enhancement in Acidic Water Oxidation of Trigonal Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 electrocatalyst, synthesized via the molten&#8208;alkali method, leverages high&#8208;valence ion doping to create abundant oxygen vacancies. These vacancies enhance acidic OER performance by reducing OH intermediate adsorption energy and lowering the rate&#8208;determining step barrier in the AEM pathway.







Abstract
Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and sustained activity for over 650&#8197;hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70&#8197;V (~1200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for over 140&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8197;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanoflowers on Nickel Hollow Fiber for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers were grown on a hollow fiber electrode with a 3D hierarchical porous structure for exclusive and stable CO2 conversion to formate at ampere&#8208;level current densities. An extremely high CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% is achieved through the significantly enhanced mass transfer, well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and favorable *OCHO intermediate formation.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere&#8208;level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large&#8208;scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three&#8208;dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99&#8201;% and a CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94&#8201;% for 520&#8197;h at a current density of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and Sn&#8722;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.

         <title>Phosphorescent Liquid Crystalline Polymer&#8208;based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides for Enhanced Photonic Signal Processing and Information Encryption</title>

         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized phosphorescent optical waveguides with high efficiency have been designed and synthesized using liquid crystalline polymers. These waveguides exhibit low optical loss and emit circularly polarized phosphorescence, making them promising candidates for applications in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguides have significant potential for advancing photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the development of CPL optical waveguides materials (OWMs) with low optical loss coefficient remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this, we design and synthesize CPL OWMs based on room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Experimental results demonstrate that these LCPs exhibit a nematic liquid crystal phase and a phosphorescence lifetime of approximately 0.145&#8197;ms. By introducing a chiral dopant, we induce a chiral arrangement in the LCPs, followed by crosslinking via photo&#8208;cycloaddition and removal of the chiral dopants through solvent soaking. The resulting polymers exhibit stable solvent resistance and highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) properties, with dissymmetric factors (gRTP) in the range of 0.16 to 0.17. Notably, the CPP&#8208;active OWMs exhibit efficient circularly polarized photonic signal waveguiding, with an optical loss coefficient of approximately 0.175 dB/mm. Ultimately, these CPP&#8208;active OWMs are sucessfully applied in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching, paving the way for advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>CeO2 Modification Promotes the Oxidation Kinetics for Adipic Acid Electrosynthesis from KA Oil Oxidation at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo2O4/CeO2 is reported to be an outstanding electrocatalyst for the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid. The electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, thus resulting in AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone in water provides a promising strategy for obtaining adipic acid (AA), which is an essential feedstock in the polymer industry. However, this process is impeded by slow kinetics and limited Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to a poor understanding of the reaction mechanism. Herein, NiCo2O4/CeO2 is developed to enable the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to AA with a 0.0992&#8197;mmol&#8201; h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 yield rate and 87&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at a lower potential. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that cyclohexanol electrooxidation to AA is a gradual oxidation process involving the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, the generation of 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone, and subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. Theoretical calculations reveal that electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, leading to AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE. Kinetic analysis further elucidates the effect of CeO2 on promoting cyclohexanone adsorption and activation on the electrode surface, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, a two&#8208;electrode flow reactor is constructed to produce 72.1&#8197;mmol AA and 10.4&#8197;L H2 by using KA oil as the anode feedstock at 2.5&#8197;A (200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating promising potential.

Herein, NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is developed to enable the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to AA with a 0.0992&#8197;mmol&#8201; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; yield rate and 87&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at a lower potential. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that cyclohexanol electrooxidation to AA is a gradual oxidation process involving the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, the generation of 2-hydroxy cyclohexanone, and subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. Theoretical calculations reveal that electronic interactions between CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2-hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, leading to AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE. Kinetic analysis further elucidates the effect of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on promoting cyclohexanone adsorption and activation on the electrode surface, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, a two-electrode flow reactor is constructed to produce 72.1&#8197;mmol AA and 10.4&#8197;L H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by using KA oil as the anode feedstock at 2.5&#8197;A (200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating promising potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Nanofibers of Camptothecin Trigger Pyroptosis for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular nanofiber of camptothecin (CNF), featuring a right&#8208;handed helicity, is constructed as a pyroptosis inducer for tumor immunotherapy. Upon accumulation in the mitochondria of tumor cells, CNF induces superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby activating the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway to trigger pyroptosis. This therapeutic approach effectively modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and enhances cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Camptothecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic agent, demonstrates significant potential in cancer therapy. However, as a drug, CPT molecule suffers from poor water solubility, limited bioavailability, and insufficient immune response. Herein, we construct CPT nanofibers (CNF) with a right&#8208;handed chiral property via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which significantly overcomes the solubility barriers associated with bioavailability and improves tumor immune prognosis. The CNF exhibits high chiral asymmetry factor (gabs) (~0.11) and remarkable structure stability under pH&#8197;6.5 condition. By formulating chiral CNF with mitochondrial&#8208;targeted DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;TPP, CNF accumulates specifically in the mitochondria of cancer cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and a 3.42&#8208;fold increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to the CPT molecule. This ROS amplification activates the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway, inducing pyroptosis that promotes M1 macrophage polarization and enhances CD8+ T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity. Consequently, CNF achieves 1.8&#8208;fold greater growth inhibition of distant tumor and reduces tumor metastasis compared to the CPT molecule. Our innovative platform, assembling CPT molecules into chiral CNF structure, is highly anticipated to overcome the current clinical limitations of CPT molecules and offer a new direction for the development of next&#8208;generation immunotherapy strategies.

         <title>Anchoring Sn Nanoparticles in Necklace&#8208;Like B,N,F&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Enables Anode&#8208;Less 5V&#8208;Class Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers embedded with Sn nanoparticles are designed as a lightweight and functionalized host for anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal batteries. The macroporous framework, B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon, and lithiophilic Sn nanoparticles enable high plating capacity and homogeneous Li deposition towards anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal pouch cells with high energy density and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Li metal batteries (LMBs), particularly with a limited Li metal anode and a 5V&#8208;class cathode, offer significantly higher energy density compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the limited Li anode poses severe challenges to cycling stability due to low efficiency and large volume expansion issues associated with Li. Herein, we design a lightweight and functionalized host composed of Sn nanoparticles embedded into necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs) toward anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class LMBs. The macroporous framework can decrease the local current density to homogenize Li deposition and release structural stress to realize high areal capacity of over 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The lithiophilic B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon and Sn nanoparticles can function as high&#8208;affinity Li+ binding sites to uniformize Li nucleus growth on the internal and external surface of hollow fibers. Accordingly, the Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs enable stable dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for 1700&#8197;h even in the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. When coupled with a 5V&#8208;class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode, the assembled anode&#8208;less pouch cell also displays stable cycling performance even under harsh conditions.

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs) with different positively charged groups were fabricated. The strong confinement effect affords ultrahigh H3PO4 retention capability under hydration condition, and the suitable H&#8208;bond length between H3PO4 and highly interconnected H&#8208;bond network enables ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport.







Abstract
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8722;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7&#8201;&#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Accurate Molecular Sensing based on a Modular and Customizable CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we establish a universal nanopore sensing strategy named CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes of distinctive nanopore signals. The detection thus can be easily customized into various application scenes with all advantages of high accuracy, high resolution, high simplicity and multi&#8208;assay available.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanopore is a promising single molecular detection technique, but is largely limited by relatively low resolution to small&#8208;size targets and laborious design of signaling probes. Here we establish a universal, CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes via a &#8220;Signal&#8208;ON&#8221; mode. Target recognition activates the cleavage activity of a Cas12a/crRNA system and then completely digest the blocker of an initiator. The unblocked initiator then triggers downstream DNA assembly reaction and generate a large&#8208;size structure easy for nanopore detection. Such integration of Cas12a/crRNA with DNA assembly establishes an accurate correspondence among the input targets, output DNA structures, and the ultimate nanopore signals. We demonstrated dsDNA, long RNA (i.e., Flu virus gene), short microRNA (i.e., let&#8208;7d) and non&#8208;nucleic acids (i.e., Pb2+) as input paradigms. Various structural assembly reactions, such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR), G&#8208;HCR and duplex polymerization strategy (DPS), are adapted as outputs for nanopore signaling. Simultaneous assay is also verified via transferring FluA and FluB genes into HCR and G&#8208;HCR, respectively. CANON is thus a modular sensing platform holding multiple advantages such as high accuracy, high resolution and high universality, which can be easily customized into various application scenes.

&lt;p&gt;Solid-state nanopore is a promising single molecular detection technique, but is largely limited by relatively low resolution to small-size targets and laborious design of signaling probes. Here we establish a universal, CRISPR/Cas-Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes via a &#8220;Signal-ON&#8221; mode. Target recognition activates the cleavage activity of a Cas12a/crRNA system and then completely digest the blocker of an initiator. The unblocked initiator then triggers downstream DNA assembly reaction and generate a large-size structure easy for nanopore detection. Such integration of Cas12a/crRNA with DNA assembly establishes an accurate correspondence among the input targets, output DNA structures, and the ultimate nanopore signals. We demonstrated dsDNA, long RNA (i.e., Flu virus gene), short microRNA (i.e., let-7d) and non-nucleic acids (i.e., Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) as input paradigms. Various structural assembly reactions, such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR), G-HCR and duplex polymerization strategy (DPS), are adapted as outputs for nanopore signaling. Simultaneous assay is also verified via transferring FluA and FluB genes into HCR and G-HCR, respectively. CANON is thus a modular sensing platform holding multiple advantages such as high accuracy, high resolution and high universality, which can be easily customized into various application scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Poly[2]rotaxane Networks via Dynamic C&#8722;N Bond Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent adaptable networkshave been created that feature oligo[2]rotaxane backbones densely integrated with mechanical bonds and cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones provide mechanical robustness and enable unique mechanical adaptability through the dissociation of host&#8211;guest interactions followed by a sliding motion. The dynamic C&#8722;N bond transalkylation at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites imparts the material with excellent reprocessability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), a novel class of crosslinked polymers with dynamic covalent bonds, have gained significant attention for combining the durability of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics, making them promising for emerging applications. Here, we report the first example of poly[2]rotaxane&#8208;type covalent adaptable networks (PRCANs), in which oligo[2]rotaxane backbones characterized by densely packed mechanical bonds, are cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones could guarantee the mechanical properties of the CANs. Under an external force, the synergy of numerous microscopic motions of the cascade [2]rotaxane units, progressively introducing the initially hidden short chains, expands the polymer network, imparting good stretchability to the PRCANs (217&#8201;%). On the other hand, the dissociation of host&#8208;guest recognition, followed by the motion of mechanical bonds, constitutes a unique energy dissipation pathway, ultimately enhancing the toughness of PRCANs (7.6&#8197;MJ/m3). In contrast, the control CAN, which lacks movable mechanical bonds, demonstrates significantly lower stretchability (40&#8201;%) and toughness (1.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, the dynamic C&#8722;N bond can undergo high efficiency of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole alkylation and trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchanges at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites at elevated temperatures, with good reprocessability and without compromising their mechanical performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of oligo[2]rotaxanes as a novel polymer backbone for the development of sustainable materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>Delocalized Nonbonding Orbitals of Thioxanthone in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Reduced Energy Gap and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyl groups have been incorporated into fused organoboron multiple resonance emitters. 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with maxima at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maximum of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the nonbonding orbital of 2TXBN delocalizes within the thioxanthone segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls, specifically thioxanthone (TX), hold great potential in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While the development of narrowband OLEDs with chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls remains challenging due to difficulties in achieving both high device efficiency and narrow emission spectra. Herein, via a strategic incorporation of the TX moiety, two orange&#8208;red narrowband emitters, 2TXBN and BNTXBN, are designed and synthesized for the first time. Both 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with peaks at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maxima of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Notably, 2TXBN demonstrates delocalization of the nonbonding orbital within the TX segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This electronic structural adjustment effectively shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime, leading to enhanced device performance. Accordingly, OLED employing 2TXBN as the emitter achieves remarkable performance, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 69.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 76.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, highlighting the efficacy of the nonbonding orbital delocalization strategy in achieving bathochromic&#8208;shifted narrowband OLED materials.

         <title>Leveraging Multivalent Assembly towards High&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Phase Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy based on the supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules has been used to obtain high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP) rosettes. The assembled rosettes demonstrate excellent HTLP emissions even in various high&#8208;temperature polar media such as boiling water, DMSO and NMP as a result of the suppression of non&#8208;radiative dissipations through multivalent interactions.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their expanded application prospects, whereas they still suffer from severe deactivation in polar media, limiting their reliability and utility. Here, we present an efficient multivalent assembly strategy to achieve high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP). The supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules leads to extremely robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, which firmly immobilize the organic phosphors and protect triplet excitons from annihilation in high&#8208;temperature polar media, resulting in excellent HTLP emission. Moreover, the photophysical properties of HTLP are significantly enhanced by boosting multivalent interactions using multitopic phosphors, demonstrating a visible afterglow of 5&#8197;s in boiling water, more than 2&#8197;s in dimethylsulfoxide at 460&#8197;K (187&#8201;&#176;C), and a long lifetime of 70.3&#8197;ms in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone at 476&#8197;K (203&#8201;&#176;C). Based on their fluidity and robust HTLP emission, in&#8197;situ microcracks detection of high&#8208;temperature operating instruments and spatial&#8208;time&#8208;temperature&#8208;resolved anticounterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen of Bi2O3 by Interstitial Insertion of Indium for Efficient Formic Acid Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of active indium atoms enhances the bond stability within Bi2O3 lattice and preserves the oxygen stability, leading to In&#8208;Bi2O3 catalysts that deliver high current densities with excellent formic acid selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and robust stability over prolonged electrochemical operations.







Abstract
Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) emerges as a potent catalyst for converting CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH), leveraging its abundant lattice oxygen and the high activity of its Bi&#8722;O bonds. Yet, its durability is usually impeded by the loss of lattice oxygen causing structure alteration and destabilized active bonds. Herein, we report an innovative approach via the interstitial incorporation of indium (In) into the Bi2O3, significantly enhancing bond stability and preserving lattice oxygen. The optimized In&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;100 catalyst achieves over 90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production across a wide potential range, in both H&#8208;cells and flow cells, maintaining robust stability after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. In situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial In doping precisely tunes the adsorption of CO2* and OCHO* intermediate, facilitating rapid conversion. Further in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the role of In bolstering the oxidized structure's stability within Bi2O3, critical for sustaining lattice oxygen during electrochemical CO2 reduction.

The optimized In-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-100 catalyst achieves over 90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production across a wide potential range, in both H-cells and flow cells, maintaining robust stability after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. In situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial In doping precisely tunes the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;* and OCHO* intermediate, facilitating rapid conversion. Further in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the role of In bolstering the oxidized structure's stability within Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, critical for sustaining lattice oxygen during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sym&#8208; and Asym&#8208;Expanded Heterohelicene Isomers Featuring Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Skeleton for Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers were developed by one&#8208;pot borylation synthesis, which exhibit narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with record&#8208;setting FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Corresponding OLED showed superb performance with external quantum efficiency up to 25&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high luminance of 10, 000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Expanded heterohelicenes composed of alternating linearly and angularly fused multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeletons have gained wide interest owing to their promising narrowband emissions. Herein, a pair of sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers was obtained by merging boron/oxygen (B/O)&#8208;embedded MR triangulene and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units via one&#8208;pot synthesis. Owing to their fully resonating extended helical skeleton, the target heterohelicenes exhibit a significantly narrowed spectra bandwidth while emission red&#8208;shifting, thus affording deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission with a peak at approximately 460&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 18&#8197;nm, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. In comparison to the symmetrical structure, the asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene displays suppressed aggregation within doped films, thereby showing superior narrowband electroluminescence in devices with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a high external quantum efficiency of up to 25&#8201;%, which retains 18.1&#8201;% even at a high luminance of 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides a novel paradigm for the development of narrowband expanded heterohelicenes.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Framework as a Highly Porous Photosensitizer for Environmental Remediation and Pollutants Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with hbc topology. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications ranging from dual&#8208;mode fluorescence sensing to pollutants removal from aqueous solutions and detoxification of a mustard gas simulant via photosensitization.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF, which crystallizes in AA&#8208;stacking mode with hcb topology. A comprehensive characterization reveals high crystallinity and enhanced stability in a variety of solvents, excellent mesoporosity (SABET=1042&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), broad light absorption in the visible region, and red emission upon the exfoliation of few&#8208;layer COF nanosheets. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications. Pollutants Bisphenol A (BPA, qmax=426&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Methylene Blue (MB, qmax=96&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) have been efficiently removed from H2O. Fluorescence quenching or enhancement of exfoliated BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF nanosheets have been utilized for dual&#8208;mode sensing of MB or NEt3, respectively. Ultimately, the photosensitizing effect of the BODIPY units is retained in the COF. Thus, BPD&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF was established as a metal&#8208;free triplet photosensitizer, which efficiently oxidized a mustard gas simulant under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Size&#8208;Adjustable High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles as an Efficient Platform for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

A series of ultrasmall and size&#8208;tunable high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles are synthesized via a spatially confined strategy, which demonstrate a size&#8208;dependent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. The nanosize of HEA also has a significant impact on its catalytic performance. However, accurately controlling nanosize and synthesizing small HEA nanomaterials remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the impact of size on the electronic structure of HEA as well as the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates involved in typical electrocatalytic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3&#8722; electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9&#8197;nm) using a one&#8208;step spatially confined approach, without any further treatment. Experimentally, the smaller size of HEAs is more favorable for the HER and ORR performances, aligning well with theoretical predictions. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles sized at 1.7&#8197;nm (HEA&#8208;1.7) endows a 16&#8197;mV overpotential at current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9&#8197;A&#8201;mgNM&#8722;1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions (e.g. CO2, NO3&#8722;) attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Photothermal Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To extend the scope of photothermal metal phenolic networks (MPN), a photothermal library of 80 MPNs was made in&#8208;house and used for the construction of machine learning models. Potential high photothermal MPNs were screened from a virtual library of 44,438 MPN by the optimal model and verified by experiments.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) demonstrates significant potential in cancer treatment, wound healing, and antibacterial therapy, with its efficacy largely depending on the performance of photothermal agents (PTAs). Metal&#8208;phenolic network (MPN) materials are ideal PTA candidates due to their low cost, good biocompatibility and excellent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer properties. However, not all MPNs exhibit significant photothermal properties, and the vast chemical space of MPNs (over 700,000 potential combinations) complicates the screening of high&#8208;photothermal materials. To address this challenge, this study introduces machine learning (ML) methods for predicting the photothermal performance of MPNs. A database of photothermal properties of 80 modular MPNs was constructed, and the ML process was optimized through feature engineering and model training. The selected extreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost) successfully identified 1,654 high photothermal MPNs from a virtual database of 44,438. Subsequent experimental validation revealed a remarkable success rate of 70&#8201;% in predicting high photothermal MPNs. Additionally, several previously unreported high photothermal MPNs were discovered, demonstrating advantages in photothermal antibacterial applications. This study offers an innovative ML&#8208;driven approach for the efficient screening of MPN materials, providing a solid foundation for PTA design in PTT and other biomedical applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal therapy (PTT) demonstrates significant potential in cancer treatment, wound healing, and antibacterial therapy, with its efficacy largely depending on the performance of photothermal agents (PTAs). Metal-phenolic network (MPN) materials are ideal PTA candidates due to their low cost, good biocompatibility and excellent ligand-to-metal charge transfer properties. However, not all MPNs exhibit significant photothermal properties, and the vast chemical space of MPNs (over 700,000 potential combinations) complicates the screening of high-photothermal materials. To address this challenge, this study introduces machine learning (ML) methods for predicting the photothermal performance of MPNs. A database of photothermal properties of 80 modular MPNs was constructed, and the ML process was optimized through feature engineering and model training. The selected extreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost) successfully identified 1,654 high photothermal MPNs from a virtual database of 44,438. Subsequent experimental validation revealed a remarkable success rate of 70&#8201;% in predicting high photothermal MPNs. Additionally, several previously unreported high photothermal MPNs were discovered, demonstrating advantages in photothermal antibacterial applications. This study offers an innovative ML-driven approach for the efficient screening of MPN materials, providing a solid foundation for PTA design in PTT and other biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Blue Narrowband OLED Devices with External Quantum Efficiency Beyond 35&#8201;% through Horizontal Dipole Orientation Induced by Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host (8CzTPS) with a strong positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and a dendritic emitter (D2&#8208;DBN) with multiple negative ESP sites was used to induce a high horizontal dipole orientation of 83.0&#8201;% for the emitter in solution&#8208;processed films. The resulting blue narrowband device realizes an external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) device has drawn great attention due to their outstanding efficiency and color purity. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed MR&#8208;TADF devices is still far behind their vacuum&#8208;deposited counterparts, due to the uncontrollable horizontal emitting dipole orientation for emitters during solution process, resulting in low light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy namely electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host with high positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and dendritic emitter with multiple negative ESP sites, which could induce high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;||) up to 83.0&#8201;% in solution&#8208;processed films. For this couple, the largest plane of dendritic host tends to anchor on the substrate, and thus the strong positive electrostatic site mainly lies at the exposed tetraphenylsilicon, which could electrostatically attract the multiple negative electrostatic sites of the dendritic emitter, realizing horizontal dipole orientation. Moreover, the highly twisted structure of dendritic host and dendron encapsulation of emitter could effectively suppress aggregation, leading a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.6&#8201;%. As a result, the solution&#8208;processed blue MR&#8208;TADF devices exhibit a record&#8208;break external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;%, as well as narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.176).

The champion device with the mixed&#8208;SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 25.6&#8201;%) with long&#8208;term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h and 180&#8197;h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high&#8208;efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26&#8201;%. However, the poor coverage and non&#8208;uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Cubic Quantum Dots along Supramolecular Templates of Naphthalenediimide Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional array superstructures of cubic quantum dots are formed by sandwiching them between unique supramolecular polymer templates composed of organic molecular assemblies. The array superstructures of cubic quantum dots exhibit energy transfer between uniformly arranged quantum dots.







Abstract
Precise control of assembled structures of quantum dots (QDs) is crucial for realizing the desired photophysical properties, but this remains challenging. Especially, the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) control is rare due to the nearly isotropic nature of QDs. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for controlling the 1D&#8208;arrangement range of cubic perovskite QDs in solution based on the morphological modification of a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The original template with a short and tangled fibrous structure is prepared in a low&#8208;polarity solvent mixture via self&#8208;assembly of a naphthalenediimide&#8208;functionalized cholesterol derivative with an adhesion group for QDs. Mixing this template with QDs leads to the co&#8208;aggregation into short&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs on the templates. Notably, subsequent heating and cooling of the co&#8208;aggregate solution forms longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs with lateral growth, where arranged QDs are sandwiched between reconstructed SP templates. Furthermore, the longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;array of QDs is achieved via an alternative route involving the pre&#8208;organization of templates into longer and dispersed fibers by heating and cooling of the original template, succeeded by co&#8208;assembly with QDs. Finally, we reveal continuous fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photoluminescence decay curves.

         <title>From Guest&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Molecular Imprinting: Calculation&#8208;Guided Discovery of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Tetrazole Frameworks for p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic principles for the guest&#8208;induced crystallization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were established from crystal structure data and DFT calculations of the formation energy. Suitable guests could be identified for kinetically challenging but structurally interesting HOFs. Moreover, a new HOF for p&#8208;xylene separation with molecular imprinting effect was discovered.







Abstract
Exploring host&#8211;guest interactions to regulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding assembly offers a promising approach for developing advanced porous crystal materials (PCMs). However, screening compatible guests with appropriate geometries and host&#8211;guest interactions that could inhibit the dense packing of building blocks remains a primary challenge. This study presents a novel guest&#8208;induced crystallization (GIC) strategy, guided by thermodynamic calculations, to develop porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) using structurally challenging tetrazole building units. Thermodynamic principles are established from the crystal structure data and the density functional theory calculation of the formation energy (&#916;E). This provides criteria to identify available guests in GIC, enabling the successful discovery of a hidden HOF that is kinetically challenging to crystallize. Furthermore, the potential application for p&#8208;xylene (PX) separation is predicted by analyzing the &#916;E of guest&#8208;induced HOFs. A high PX selectivity (PX/m&#8208;xylene=6.1, PX/o&#8208;xylene=7.2, and PX/ethylbenzene=4.1) is achieved through selective inclusion of PX from C8 aromatic isomers within the guest&#8208;induced HOFs. Significantly, the guest&#8208;free HOF (HOF&#8208;PX&#8208;a), bearing PX&#8208;templated cavities derived from molecular imprinting, shows a record&#8208;high PX/ethylbenzene selectivity (21.7) in liquid adsorption. This work elucidates the underpinning self&#8208;assembly rules of GIC for HOF construction, providing exciting new opportunities for the predictable assembly of PCMs for molecular recognition and target&#8208;specific separations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;Isochamaecydin and their Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;epimers is presented. Our synthesis is highlighted by a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/addition reaction to connect the A&#8722;B ring system with E ring system through a convergent strategy and a Michael/aldol cascade for constructing the central C&#8722;D ring system, allowing for a rapid construction of the pentacyclic framework.







Abstract
A modular approach was developed for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of naturally occurring C30 terpene quinone methides and their non&#8208;natural stereoisomers, which feature the presence of an unprecedented spiro[4.4]nonane&#8208;containing 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8208;5&#8211;5&#8211;3 hexacyclic skeleton. Resting on a chiral phosphinamide&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reduction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, a concise route for the synthesis of enantioenriched 6&#8211;6 bicyclic fragment was developed. The 6&#8211;6 ring fragment and the five&#8208;membered ring fragment were unified via a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular addition reaction. Subsequently, the central 6&#8211;5 bicyclic ring system was constructed through a Michael/aldol cascade. The successful establishment of these strategic transformations allowed for an efficient and rapid construction of spiroannulated 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5&#8211;5 pentacarbocyclic core via a convergent manner. Finally, the total syntheses of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their corresponding 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;stereoisomers have been achieved divergently by appropriately orchestrating the reaction sequence including isopropyl incorporation, oxidation state adjustment, and carbonyl group&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclopropanation at a late stage.

         <title>Cationic Magnetically Active Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon with Record Low Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended long polycyclic hydrocarbon incorporating two pyrrole units has been developed. Its cationic species exhibit remarkable electronic and magnetic properties, including a record&#8208;low energy gap for the cationic radical, with an extinction coefficient of 3.8&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 2570&#8197;nm, and unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge transfer. The dication exhibits high Chichibabin diradical character with separated spin localizations.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted significant interest in material chemistry, particularly if they own extremely low band gaps and magnetic properties. However, challenges remain regarding the synthetic accessibility and energy saturation issues. In this study, we introduce NR&#8208;11, which consists of eleven aromatic rings in its main conjugation and is separately doped with two electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms. This unique structure imparts intriguing oxidation characteristics to NR&#8208;11. The cationic radical NR&#8208;11+&#8901; exhibits enhanced stability and demonstrates strong absorption in the range of 1250&#8197;nm to 3000&#8197;nm, peaking at 2570&#8197;nm. As a result, the optical energy gap of NR&#8208;11+&#8901; is one of the lowest reported to date. Additionally, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveals that NR&#8208;11+&#8901; displays unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation. For the dication, variable&#8208;temperature NMR and variable&#8208;temperature EPR studies indicate that NR&#8208;112+ exhibits a high diradical character with a &#9653;ES&#8208;T of approximately &#8722;1&#8197;kcal/mol. Additionally, its spins are polarized at two ends of the PAH. Meanwhile, its strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II region suggests promise in photoacoustic (PA) conversion applications. This work underscores the significance of cationic species of extended long PAHs, highlighting their exceptional properties and potential applications.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking of FeN4 Moiety via Edge Defects for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through morphology engineering, asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon is introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, effectively breaking the symmetry of the FeN4 structure and enabling precise control over its geometric and electronic properties, thereby enhancing catalytic activity for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, with a planar D4h symmetric FeN4 structure, show promising as noble metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction catalysts. Nonetheless, the highly symmetric structure restricts the effective manipulation of its geometric and electronic structures, impeding further enhancements in oxygen reduction reaction performance. Here, a high proportion of asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon was successfully introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts through morphology engineering, enabling the precise modulation of the FeN4 active site. Electrochemical experimental results demonstrate that FeN4@porous carbon (FeN4@PC), featuring enriched asymmetric edge&#8208;FeN4 active sites, exhibits higher acidic oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity compared to FeN4@flaky carbon (FeN4@FC), where symmetric FeN4 is primarily distributed within the basal&#8208;plane. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectra, X&#8208;ray emission spectra, and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity of FeN4@PC is attributed to the higher oxidation state of Fe species in the edge structure of FeN4@PC. This finding paves the way for controlling the local geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom active sites, leading to the development of novel and efficient Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridines at the C4 Position via Metalation and Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Butylsodium can be used to selectively deprotonate pyridine at the C4 position, in sharp contrast to organolithium reagents which lead to nucleophilic addition at the C2 position. A wide range of 4&#8208;alkyl pyridines and 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were synthesized by this protocol. Rapid injection NMR studies indicate that the interchange of different sodiopyridine species follows thermodynamic distribution and results in the selection of the C4 position.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N&#8208;atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N&#8208;atom within pyridines was overcome using n&#8208;butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4&#8208;position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4&#8208;sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4&#8208;H within 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.

         <title>Asymmetric gem&#8208;Hydroboration and gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of Ynamides: A New Gateway to Chiral Fischer Carbene Complexes and their Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation and gem&#8208;hydroboration of alkynes are highly unorthodox transformations, but asymmetric such gem&#8208;addition reactions are unprecedented. They have now been achieved with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using ynamides carrying an Evans oxazolidinone as the substrates. The resulting pianostool ruthenium carbenes were fully characterized and could even be engaged in catalytic downstream reactions.







Abstract
Ynamides, when reacted with H2 or HBpin in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4, convert into chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal Fischer carbenes by regioselective gem&#8208;hydrogenation or gem&#8208;hydroboration of the polarized triple bond, respectively. gem&#8208;Hydroboration concomitantly affords a carbogenic borylated stereocenter adjacent to the ruthenium carbene unit, the configuration of which can be controlled using an Evans auxiliary. These are the first examples of asymmetric gem&#8208;addition reactions to alkynes known in the literature; representative pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes formed by this unconventional route were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic means. They undergo various stoichiometric reactions and can even entertain catalytic asymmetric transformations, such as hydrogenative cyclopropanations or a novel type of borylative cycloisomerization.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Copper Pair Sites on Inverse CeO2/Cu Catalyst Enable Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu pair sites are identified as the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol under acidic conditions. By maximizing the density of active pair sites, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;driven electrochemical reduction of CO2 offers a promising route for the production of high&#8208;value ethanol. However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to a limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu (Ov&#8208;Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov&#8208;involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO&#8208;CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic&#8208;level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Imines and Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes is reported for the first time. Tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted chiral allylamines were synthesized in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies show that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst drives oxidative cyclization. Zinc acts as an electron source and a transmetallating agent for catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Chiral allylamines are important structural components in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes to synthesize chiral allylamines. The reaction is catalyzed by a cobalt complex derived from commercially available bisphosphine ligand utilizing zinc as the electron donor. The substrate scope is extensive. Symmetric and unsymmetric alkyl and aryl alkynes have been successfully coupled with various imines derived from aryl and alkyl aldehydes. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl amines were isolated in high yields, with enantiomeric excess surpassing &gt;99.9&#8201;% and regioselectivities exceeding &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1. These chiral allyl amines can serve as versatile platforms for subsequent transformations while preserving their stereochemical integrity. Extensive experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism. These investigations have indicated that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst enables the oxidative cyclization of alkynes and imines, and a spin crossover occurs during the enantio&#8208;determining step. Zinc plays a pivotal role in facilitating the transmetallation of the resulting azacobaltacycle. The observed enantioselectivity was interpreted by the stabilization of the transition state through higher stabilizing interaction energy from high negative polarization, dispersion, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Dislocations of TiO2 Support of PdZn&#8722;ZnO Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts to Boost CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering lattice dislocations of TiO2 support, a dual&#8208;site catalyst with a synergistic combination of highly alloyed PdZn and hydroxyl&#8208;/oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO was developed for efficient CO2 hydrogenation, achieving the selective and robust methanol synthesis performance (9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) via deviating the reaction routes from the carboxylate pathway to formate pathway.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green hydrogen derived from renewable resources provides a promising method for sustainable carbon cycle but suffers from high selectivity towards byproduct CO. Here, we develop an efficient PdZn&#8722;ZnO/TiO2 catalyst by engineering lattice dislocation structures of TiO2 support. We discover that this modification orders irregularly arranged atoms in TiO2 to stabilize crystal lattice, and consequently weakens electronic interactions with supported active phases. It facilitates the transformation of metallic Pd into PdZn alloy, effectively suppressing CO production through inhibiting the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction mediated by the carboxylate pathway on Pd0 sites. Moreover, it enables the efficient transfer of hydrogen species via hydrogen spillover from PdZn alloy to ZnO for compensating the poor hydrogen dissociation ability of ZnO, thereby creating both more oxygen vacancies essential for CO2 activation and a hydroxyl&#8208;rich environment conducive to hydrogenation of intermediates. These collective modifications on PdZn&#8722;ZnO dual sites synergistically induce the propensity of the formate pathway for methanol synthesis. Consequently, compared to the unmodified catalyst, our as&#8208;designed catalyst increases methanol selectivity from 64.2 to 80.0&#8201;%, reduces CO selectivity from 35.0 to 19.8&#8201;%, and achieves an impressive methanol space&#8208;time yield of 9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at a similar CO2 conversion (~8.0&#8201;%).

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Carbon&#8208;Centered Radical Sites for Promoting the 4e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks with well&#8208;defined, stable carbon&#8208;centered radical sites were prepared by a facile post&#8208;oxidation process. The redox&#8208;active carbon radical sites demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity in promoting the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway and greatly suppressing the 2e&#8722; pathway, thus contributing to safer and more sustainable fuel cell and metal&#8208;air battery applications.







Abstract
Radical covalent organic frameworks (RCOFs) have demonstrated significant potential in redox catalysis and energy conversion applications. However, the synthesis of stable RCOFs with well&#8208;defined neutral carbon radical centers is challenging due to the inherent radical instability, limited synthetic methods and characterization difficulties. Building upon the understanding of stable carbon radicals and structural modulations for preparing crystalline COFs, herein we report the synthesis of a crystalline carbon&#8208;centered RCOF through a facile post&#8208;oxidation process. Moreover, the RCOF demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity in the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and electron transfer number of 3.98, among the highest in reported COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The promoted 4e&#8722; and suppressed 2e&#8722; ORR pathway (99.5&#8201;% vs. 0.5&#8201;%) can be attributed to facilitated reaction initiation and smoother transition steps at the carbon radical sites, which is practically beneficial for minimizing peroxide formation, thus contributing to safer and more sustainable fuel cell and metal&#8208;air battery applications. Overall, our study not only provided a facile strategy for preparing stable RCOFs with well&#8208;defined neutral carbon radical centers but also demonstrated their capability to fine&#8208;tune the redox catalytic activity of COF materials, which could be potentially useful in electrocatalysis and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Regulation of TADF by Internal and External Heavy Atom Effect in D&#8208;A MOF for Heterocrystal based Temperature&#8208;Compensated Photonic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facilely tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was realized by synergy of internal and external heavy atom effect induced by decorated &#8208;Br on different components in donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic frameworks (D&#8722;A MOFs). Photonic temperature compensated device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary tendency of temperature&#8208;dependent emission intensity, indicating a potential paradigm in photonic integrated circuits (PICs).







Abstract
The application of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field. Herein, we report a new library of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8722;A MOF) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the fabricating of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device by virtue of the unique temperature response character of TADF emitters. Highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) of TADF was realized within the D&#8722;A MOFs through a novel strategy that synergistically combines the internal heavy atom effect (HAE) with an external HAE, induced by the incorporation of heavy atoms into different components, achieving the regulable photophysical indicators including adjustable PL wavelength (534 to 592&#8197;nm) and surging quantum yield (5.02&#8201;%&#8211;47.39&#8201;%). Further investigation of the impact of external HAE on TADF was conducted through crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface plots of four D&#8722;A regimes featuring substituent&#8208;based linkers. Notably, temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary temperature response. The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215&#8197;K to 295&#8197;K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8722;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.

         <title>Vesicle&#8208;Encapsulated Chemosensing Ensembles Allow Monitoring of Transmembrane Uptake Coupled with Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have encapsulated a host&#8211;guest reporter pair together with three enzymes within vesicles to monitor a two&#8208;compartment cascade reaction which includes transmembrane transport of peptide substrates and their subsequent enzymatic conversion inside the vesicles. Our &#8220;protocell&#8221; system mimics a simplistic cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism cycle. To reflect the various mechanisms of nutrient uptake by cells, we studied the uptake of different analytes by means of pore&#8208;forming proteins, amphiphilic transmembrane carriers, and direct bilayer permeation.







Abstract
Compartmentalized models with coupled catalytic networks are considered as &#8220;protocells&#8221; in the context of research related to the origin of life. To model the kinetics of a simple cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism process, we use a compartmentalized protocell system that combines liposome&#8208;encapsulated intravesicular reporter pairs with co&#8208;encapsulated enzymes to monitor the membrane transport of a substrate (analyte uptake) and its subsequent enzymatic reaction inside the vesicles (metabolism to the product). The intravesicular chemosensing ensembles consist of the macrocycles cucurbit[7]uril or p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene and matching fluorescent dyes to set up suitable reporter pairs. When these macrocycle/dye reporter pairs are co&#8208;encapsulated with enzymes (trypsin, protein kinase A, or butyrylcholinesterase), it is possible to monitor first the transport of different substrates (polylysine, protamine, H&#8208;LRRWSLG&#8208;OH, or butyrylcholine) through added pores (outer membrane proteins F and C), with synthetic carriers (amphiphilic calixarenes), or by direct permeation (only for butyrylcholine). The subsequent enzymatic conversions of the substrates after they have entered the corresponding protocells can be monitored as consecutive reactions. The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.

         <title>Intensifying Interfacial Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters is proposed for remarkably boosted NO3RR. Benefiting from strengthened reverse hydrogen spillover effect via elegantly engineering the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface, *H generated from Ni3N can rapidly transfer to Cu site through Ni&#8722;N&#8722;Cu bridge bond for deoxygenation/hydrogenation steps, thus delivering a prominent NO3RR performance, favorably presenting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level.







Abstract
Rational regulation of active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial for advancing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3), yet in&#8208;depth understanding of the *H generation, transfer, and utilization remains ambiguous, and explorations for *H dynamic optimization are urgently needed. Herein we engineer a Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters (NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu) for remarkably boosted NO3RR. From comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the Ni3N moieties favors water dissociation to generate *H, and then *H can rapidly transfer to the Cu via unique reverse hydrogen spillover mediating interfacial Ni&#8722;N&#8722;Cu bridge bond, thus increasing *H coverage on the Cu site for subsequent deoxygenation/hydrogenation. More impressively, such intriguing reverse hydrogen spillover effect can be further strengthened via elegant engineering of the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface with more intimate contact. Consequently, the NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu with Cu nanoclusters intimate anchoring presents record NH3 yield rate of 1.19&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 98.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, being on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ones. Additionally, with NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu as the cathode, a high&#8208;performing Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery can be assembled. This contribution illuminates a novel pathway to optimize *H behavior via distinct reverse hydrogen spillover for promoted NO3RR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Li+ Quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Topochemistry Transport Enables Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of limited Li+ mobility in traditional molten salt, which hinders the prelithiation and regeneration of spent cathodes, we present an organic/inorganic LiOH&#8208;LiNO3&#8208;LiC7H5O2 molten salt system that promotes rapid Li+ transport to the cathode surface via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism. Simulations reveal the incorporation of benzoic acid lithium salt (BAL) facilitates this quasi&#8208;Grotthuss pathway, enabling swift Li+ transport and thereby achieving effictive repair and regeneration of spent cathodes.







Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries offers economic benefits and a reduced CO2 footprint. Surface prelithiation, particularly through the molten salt method, is critical in enhancing spent cathode repair during high&#8208;temperature annealing. However, the sluggish Li+ transport kinetics, which predominantly relies on thermally driven processes in the traditional molten salt methods, limit the prelithiation efficiency and regeneration of spent cathodes. Here, we introduce a special molecular configuration (benzoate) into molten salts that facilitates rapid Li+ transport to the surface of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism. This approach effectively avoids the phase transitions that could adversely degrade the electrochemical performance due to insufficient lithiation during the repair process. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the system enables fast Li+ migration through the topological hopping of benzoate in organic lithium salt, rather than relying solely on thermally driven diffusion, thereby significantly improving the prelithiation and repair efficiency of spent NCM cathodes. Benefiting from the quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Li+ topochemistry transport, the degraded structure and Li vacancies in the spent cathode are effectively eliminated, yieding the regenerated cathode with good cycling stability comparable to commercial counterparts. The proposed Li+ transport mechanism presents a promising route for the efficient and sustainable regeneration of spent cathodes.

         <title>Optimizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Modulation Doping in Van der Waals Layered Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;resistant niobium doped Van der Waals layered edge&#8208;sharing 1&#8197;T&#8208;phase IrO2, has been successfully created, which exhibits excellent catalytic stability under the current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.7&#8197;V for 50&#8197;days PEMWE testing. Mechanism investigation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) from the *OOH deprotonation process to the *O&#8722;OH coupling process and regulate the binding strength of the intermediates.







Abstract
Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process, necessitating catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity to enhance its kinetic rate. Van der Waals layered oxides are ideal materials for catalyst design, yet its stability for acidic OER remains large obstacle. Doping provides a crucial way to improve the activity and stability simultaneously. However, doping in Van der Waals layered oxides remains a great challenge since it easily leads to lattice distortion or even the crystal structure damage. In this work, we successfully doping acid&#8208;resistant niobium (Nb) into Van der Waals layered edge&#8208;shared 1T phase iridium oxide (1&#8197;T&#8208;IrO2) via alkali&#8208;assisted thermal method. 1&#8197;T&#8208;IrO2 with a 5&#8201;% Nb doping (Nb0.05Ir0.95O2) only required an overpotential of 191&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, 56&#8197;mV lower than that of 1T&#8208;IrO2. When applied in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Nb0.05Ir0.95O2 show stable operation at a high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 50&#8197;days. Density functional theory calculation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential&#8208;determining step from the *OOH deprotonation process in 1&#8197;T&#8208;IrO2 to the *O&#8722;OH coupling process in Nb0.05Ir0.95O2.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Activated B&#8208;Doping for Efficient 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction through Suppressing H2O2 Decomposition at High Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, boron&#8208;active functional groups are introduced via vacancy activation to effectively tune the adsorption strength of the *OOH intermediate and the H2O2 product. This approach enhances the selectivity of the 2e&#8722; ORR and facilitates the timely desorption of H2O2, preventing its further decomposition on the catalyst surface, thereby enabling efficient H2O2 production under high current density conditions.







Abstract
The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) has emerged as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. Although oxidized carbon catalysts have intensive developed due to their high selectivity and activity, the yield and conversion rate of H2O2 under high overpotential still limited. The produced H2O2 was rapidly consumed by the increased intensity of H2O2 reduction, which could ascribe to decomposition of peroxide radicals under high voltage in the carbon catalyst. To overcome this issue, a B doped carbon have been developed to catalyze 2e&#8722; ORR with high efficient through suppressing H2O2 decomposition at high potential. Thus, thermal reducing of oxygen containing groups (OCGs) on graphite could construct defects and vacancies, which in situ convert to B&#8722;Cx subunits on the edge of graphene sheets. The introduction of B&#8722;Cx effectively prevented the decomposition of the *O&#8722;O bond and provided suitable adsorption capacity for *OOH, achieving excellent selectivity for the 2e&#8722; ORR across a wide voltage range. Finally, a remarkable H2O2 yield of 7.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was delivered at an industrial current density of 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which could provide &#8220;green&#8221; pathway for scale&#8208;upable synthesis H2O2.

         <dc:description>
A universal two&#8208;step method based on autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP) has enabled the synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes with Turing structures. The representative AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane with its built&#8208;in robust amide knots exhibits a good performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents.

The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two&#8208;step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide&#8208;linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built&#8208;in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra&#8208;long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 heterojunction is constructed with the superiority of mass transport, polysulfides capture and conversion. These enable a significantly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability are realized even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The heterojunction materials are considered as promising electrocatalyst candidates that empower advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8722;S battery with Bi2Te3/TiO2 TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu Sites for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol with 99.5&#8201;% Selectivity in Pure Water</title>

A red polymer carbon nitride consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites is designed to achieve an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to ethanol is extremely challenging due to the limited efficiency of charge separation, sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling, and unfavorable formation of oxygenate intermediates. Here, we elaborately design a red polymer carbon nitride (RPCN) consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites (Cu/S&#8208;RPCN) to address this challenge, which achieves an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water. Cu and S atoms within the Cu&#8722;N&#8722;S configuration can serve as trapping centers for electrons and holes, respectively, providing spatial separation for photogenerated charge carriers. The incorporation of S atoms optimizes the adsorption of *CO on Cu atoms and reduces the energy barrier for the formation of *CO&#8722;COH intermediate. The adsorption strength of *OCHCH2OH intermediate on the Cu atoms via the O&#8722;Cu&#8722;C configuration can affect the selectivity of the C2 products as the cleavage of the Cu&#8722;O/Cu&#8722;C bonds determines the ethanol/ethylene pathway. The S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu structure weakens the Cu&#8722;O bond, thereby promoting the production of ethanol. This work provides a novel approach to fine&#8208;tune the surrounding microenvironment of metal atoms on carbon nitride for highly effective photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to ethanol.

An electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester is rationally proposed to achieve a balance between low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability. This strategy endows the stable operation of ultra&#8208;high voltage (4.7&#8197;V) and ultra&#8208;wide temperature (&#8722;30 to 70&#8201;&#176;C) LiCO2 batteries, enhancing their energy density and operating temperature range simultaneously.







Abstract
LiCoO2 batteries for 3&#8197;C electronics demand high charging voltage and wide operating temperature range, which are virtually impossible for existing electrolytes due to aggravated interfacial parasitic reactions and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester solvent (i.e., DFEA) that achieves a balance between weak Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, sufficient salt dissociation, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability to address the aforementioned challenges. The resulting high&#8208;voltage wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte (HWE) not only possesses low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high oxidation stability, excellent thermal&#8208;abuse tolerance and non&#8208;flammability, but also enables the formation of both inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Owing to the above merits, this HWE endows the highly stable operation of LiCoO2 cathodes under an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.7&#8197;V and Graphite&#8201;||&#8201;LiCoO2 batteries in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;30 to 70&#8201;&#176;C. Meanwhile, a 1.7&#8197;Ah&#8208;level 4.6&#8197;V Graphite&#8201;||&#8201;LiCoO2 pouch cell with a high energy density of 240&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 also delivers excellent cycling stability, representing a significant advancement in the design of electrolytes towards ultra&#8208;high voltage and ultra&#8208;wide temperature batteries.

NiNCs@Ni&#8208;Nx strengthening electrochemical CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CO. A comprehensive DFT calculation was performed to explore the effect of Ni nanoclusters on Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3,4) SACs and guided the successful synthesis of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 catalyst with high FECO (99.7&#8201;%) and TOF (83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1) during CO2RR. The Ni6 nanoclusters can stabilize the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 sites and optimize the *COOH intermediate adsorption.







Abstract
Unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3), have been investigated to break the conventional Ni&#8208;N4 structural limitation and provide more unoccupied 3d orbitals for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorption, but their intrinsically low structural stability has seriously hindered their applications. Here, we developed a strategy by integrating Ni nanoclusters to stabilize unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO at industrial&#8208;level current. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the incorporation of Ni nanocluster effectively stabilizes the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites and modulates their electronic structure to enhance the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH during CO2RR. Guided by these insights, we prepared an optimal composite catalyst, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3, which features a Ni6N6 nanocluster surrounded by six Ni&#8208;N3 single atoms sites, through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. The morphology and coordinative structure of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 were confirmed by an aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope (AC&#8208;TEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a result, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 demonstrated a remarkably high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.7&#8201;% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;1.15&#8197;VRHE, much better than those of Ni&#8208;N4 with a lower FECO of 86&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a TOF of 39309.9&#8197;h&#8722;1under identical potential. XAS analyses of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 before and after long&#8208;term CO2RR testing confirmed the excellent stability of its coordinative environment. This work highlights a generalizable approach for stabilizing unsaturated single&#8208;atom catalysts, paving the way for their application in high&#8208;performance CO2RR.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 S&#8208;Scheme Homojunction through Van der Waals Interface Regulation by Intrinsic Polymerization Tailoring for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction with strong internal interfacial Van der Waals interactions is constructed via in&#8197;situ supramolecular thermal polycondensation. Due to the inherent difference of 0D nanodots and 2D nanoplate, g&#8208;C3N4 bandgap is regulated to realize the construction of S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, improving the carrier separation efficiency and boosting photocatalytic performance. This finding is crucial for the design of g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction.







Abstract
The effective S&#8208;scheme homojunction relies on the precise regulation of band structure and construction of advantaged charge migration interfaces. Here, the electronic structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4 were modulated through meticulous polymerization of self&#8208;assembled supramolecular precursors. Experimental and DFT results indicate that both the intrinsic bandgap and surface electronic characteristics were adjusted, leading to the formation of an in&#8208;situ reconstructed homojunction interface facilitated by intrinsic van der Waals forces. The homojunction catalyst, composed of g&#8208;C3N4 nanodots and ultra&#8208;thin g&#8208;C3N4 nanoflakes, exhibited a significant S&#8208;scheme carrier separation mechanism, which enhances the utilization of electrons and holes. Consequently, under AM 1.5 light irradiation (~100&#8197;mW/cm2), the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst achieved a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 580&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, a reversed CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction was observed, yielding 80.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.86&#8201;%, in contrast to the performance of bulk g&#8208;C3N4, which produced only 2.22&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with the 15.69&#8201;% CH4 selectivity. These findings not only highlight the significant potential of the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen production and CO2 reduction but also propose a superior and effective strategy for optimizing the structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4, which are crucial for the design of photocatalytic reactions.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all? The combination of B(C6F5)3 with a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole unleashed remarkable new possibilities, as reported by Biprajit Sarkar et al. in their Research Article (e202422702). The mirror images show the three different compounds to which the starting material can convert to: a strongly donating anionic mesoionic carbene ligand (MIC), metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane adducts and bis&#8208;borane adducts of MICs. This simple yet astonishing concept provides a platform for new, intriguing MIC&#8208;based compounds with high potential in catalysis.

   href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202422272"&gt;e202422272&lt;/a&gt;), Junbai Li, Qi Li and co-workers report a counterion co-assembly strategy to controllably synthesize a series of amino acid-based glasses with remarkable mechanical and optical properties. This work demonstrates a pathway to vitrify small biomolecules with strong crystallization tendencies and opens avenues for the advancement of supramolecular glasses.

To enhance H&#8322; evolution via water splitting, preventing deep electron traps&#8212;&#8208;often formed by anion vacancies&#8212;&#8208;is essential. Transient IR absorption spectroscopy reveals that 2D layered materials like Bi&#8324;NbOCl rarely form such traps. This is due to the formation of a defect&#8208;tolerant, bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum, which effectively suppresses deep traps while maintaining high electron reactivity. Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202419624).

The dimerization of a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cage yields two Pd4L8 catenanes with distinct topologies: a &#8220;classic&#8221; quadruply interlocked D4&#8208;symmetric structure and a newly discovered triply linked motif with C2h symmetry. The latter is stabilized by extensive non&#8208;covalent interligand contacts, opening a strategy to control the degree of mechanical interlocking, tuned by temperature and anion exchange, as reported by Guido H. Clever et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202423810).

         <title>Expediting Glycospace Exploration: Therapeutic Glycans via Automated Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of well&#8208;defined carbohydrates constitutes a nexus in glycoscience, but few conceptual paradigms have shaped the field as much as automated glycan synthesis. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances, their limitations and future perspective are discussed.







Abstract
Glycans regulate a vast spectrum of disease&#8208;related processes, yet effectively leveraging these important mediators in a therapeutic context remains a frontier in contemporary medicine. Unlike many other classes of clinically important biopolymers, carbohydrates derive from discrete biosynthetic pathways and are not produced directly from genes. The conspicuous absence of a biological blueprint to achieve amplification creates a persistent challenge in obtaining well&#8208;defined glycostructures for therapeutic translation. Isolating purified sugars from biological sources is not without challenge, rendering synthetic organic chemistry the nexus of this advancing field. Chemical synthesis has proven to be an unfaltering pillar in the production of complex glycans, but laborious syntheses coupled with purification challenges frequently introduce reproducibility issues. In an effort to reconcile these preparative challenges with the societal importance of glycans, automated glycan synthesis was conceptualised at the start of the 21st century. This rapidly expanding, multifaceted field of scientific endeavor has effectively merged synthetic chemistry with technology and engineering to expedite the precision synthesis of target glycans. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances is discussed together with current limitations and future directions.

         <title>Antimicrobial Phenolic Materials: From Assembly to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenols, primarily found in plants, can possess antimicrobial properties and have therefore been exploited widely. This review examines the antimicrobial mechanisms of polyphenols and their development into antimicrobial materials, including as particles, hydrogels, coatings and macroscopic structures. These materials hold potential for antimicrobial applications, ranging from wound healing to oral health, and offer a promising therapeutic strategy for combating and reducing the transmission of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Infectious diseases pose considerable challenges to public health, particularly with the rise of multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens that globally cause high mortality rates. These pathogens can persist on surfaces and spread in public and healthcare settings. Advances have been made in developing antimicrobial materials to reduce the transmission of pathogens, including materials composed of naturally sourced polyphenols and their derivatives, which exhibit antimicrobial potency, broad&#8208;spectrum activity, and a lower likelihood of promoting resistance. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the fabrication of antimicrobial phenolic biomaterials, where natural phenolic compounds act as active antimicrobial agents or encapsulate other antimicrobial agents (e.g., metal ions, antimicrobial peptides, natural biopolymers). Various forms of phenolic biomaterials synthesized through these two strategies, including antimicrobial particles, capsules, hydrogels, and coatings, are summarized, with a focus on their application in wound healing, bone repair and regeneration, oral health, and antimicrobial coatings for medical devices. The potential of these advanced phenolic biomaterials provides a promising therapeutic approach for combating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections and reducing microbial transmission.

Tuning nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites efficiently enhances their catalytic activity and specificity, and multifunctionality by optimizing the electronic and geometric structures. Taking advantage of unique properties, these advanced nanozymes hold great promise in sensing applications, achieving the goals of high detection sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy.







Abstract
Nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites (ADzymes), especially single&#8208;atom nanozymes, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to their unique advantages in mimicking the active sites of natural enzymes. These nanozymes not only maximize exposure of catalytic sites but also possess superior catalytic activity performance, achieving challenging catalytic reactions. These advantages position ADzymes as highly promising candidates in the field of sensing and biosensing. This review summarizes the classification and properties of ADzymes, systematically highlighting some typical regulation strategies involving central metal, coordination environment, etc., to achieve their catalytical activity, specificity, and multifunctionality. Then, we present the recent advances of ADzymes in different sensing fields, including colorimetry, fluorescence, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, and electrochemiluminescence. Taking advantage of their unique catalytic performance, the resultant ADzymes show great potential in achieving the goal of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of various targets. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms in terms of signal amplification were discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives on the development of advanced ADzymes are discussed.

         <title>Afterglow Copper(I) Iodine Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise copper(I) iodine cluster with unique afterglow emission and excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence property was constructed, which was successfully used for high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Copper(I) iodine clusters have drawn intense attention due to their advantageous photophysical properties, such as a high luminescence efficiency, large Stokes shift, and tunable luminescence lifetimes. In this work, a copper(I) iodine cluster (Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN) was synthesized, which exhibits unique afterglow emission, ultrahigh quantum yield (90.1&#8201;% in solid state) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior. It was found that thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence occur simultaneously in Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN. The unique photoluminescence properties of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN were attributed to the large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and long&#8208;term rigidity of the crystal. The high quantum efficiency, TADF characteristics, and heavy&#8208;atom composition of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN endow it with excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) properties, making it a promising X&#8208;ray scintillator. A flexible scintillator screen made of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN was successfully fabricated and used for X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Universal Reagent for Mild and Stereospecific Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A user&#8208;friendly, shelf&#8208;stable protonated betaine reagent (BEHT triflate), derived from Mitsunobu reagents, has been developed to enable the direct displacement of alcohols using primary and secondary amines as nucleophiles. The reaction with chiral, non&#8208;racemic secondary alcohols proceeds with inversion of configuration, allowing for one&#8208;step formation of C&#8722;X bonds (X=N, C, S, O, or halide).







Abstract
A user&#8208;friendly reagent for mild and general activation of alcohols towards bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) leveraging diverse nucleophiles, including primary and secondary amines is reported herein. The new ion&#8208;paired reagent discovery was based upon the putative zwitterionic betaine intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction and enabled the one&#8208;step conversion of enantioenriched alcohols to valuable chiral C&#8722;X bonds (where X=N, C, S, O or halide). The described activating reagent has also been applied to a one&#8208;step methylation reaction using methanol and to an intermolecular amination/intramolecular cyclization sequence that generates heterocycles, such as tetrahydroisoquinolines. This work provides the first evidence by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a protonated betaine as intermediate in the Mitsunobu reaction.

         <title>Cationic, Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated and Directed Diastereoselective Oxidation of Inert C&#8722;H Bonds in Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(III)&#8208;mediated, selective oxidation of remote C&#8722;H bonds is reported. This approach relies on the generation of a destabilized carbocation that is coerced into a predetermined position through charge relocation. In&#8208;depth experiments give insight into the mechanistic intricacies of this highly diastereoselective transformation.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, the functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds has become a workhorse of synthesis. In the field of C&#8722;H bond oxygenation, most established methods hinge on single&#8208;electron reactivity, encountering challenges pertaining to regio&#8208; and/or stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a conceptually distinct strategy relying on the unique features of carbocation chemistry. Our iodine(III)&#8208;mediated method achieves the diastereoselective oxygenation of remote C&#8722;H bonds at traditionally unreactive sites and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization at steroidal frameworks as well as an unusual chirality relay.

         <title>Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of Pd2L4 cage leads to formation two distinct Pd4L8 species with different interlocking degree: the classical quadruply interlocked double cage and a novel triply interlocked double cage, representing a previously unreported topology for Pd4L8 complexes. The degree of interlocking and equilibrium in the double cage system can be controlled thermally and through anion exchange.







Abstract
Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd4L8 catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of D4 symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of C2h symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.

         <title>Aryl Silicon Nucleophiles in Bismuth Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis is reported, in the context of the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We present a catalytic protocol utilizing bismuth for the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones, showcasing a seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis. This catalytic process is enabled by a series of Bi&#8208;based organometallic transformations, including an unprecedented transmetalation of aryl silicates to Bi(III) complexes and the formal migratory insertion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the Bi&#8208;C bond. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.

The second known three&#8208;dimensional borosulfate anionic topology demonstrates remarkable adaptability to hosting mono&#8208; and trivalent cations including the very first antimony borosulfates. Distinct one&#8208;dimensional channels accommodate these ions, with varying combinations leading systematically to different space groups. Our initial characterization includes single crystal as well as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermal analysis.







Abstract
Recently we reported the synthesis and characterization of Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4, at that time representing only the second tectosilicate analogous borosulfate. Inspired by this structure type, we herein present the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry. MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII=Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI=H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) were synthesised under solvothermal conditions and show a large variability towards their mono&#8208; and trivalent cation while retaining the same three&#8208;dimensional anionic network. Based on their combination, the titled compounds crystallize in the tetragonal space groups I

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Allows Control of Remote Stereochemistry in Asymmetric Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral ligand and a racemic keto&#8208;alcohol starting material allows a hydrogen borrowing cyclisation reaction to form products with both high yields and high enantioselectivity. The excellent yields and enantiomeric purities of the products formed from a racemic starting material are indicative of a dynamic kinetic resolution process involving a base labile cyclohexene intermediate. Finally, the cyclic products can be easily manipulated to a wide range of enantiopure acyl cyclohexanes.







Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;substituted ketones via hydrogen borrowing alkylation of both racemic linear precursors and 1,5&#8208;diols is described. The base mediated racemization of an intermediate cyclohexenone to facilitates a dynamic kinetic resolution, affording highly enantioenriched cyclohexanes in excellent yields, which could be further functionalized by removal of the Ph* group. DFT modelling revealed the mode of enantioinduction to be a stepwise process comprising of a hydride transfer and a coordination change to a &#960;&#8208;allylic enolate complex with the iridium catalyst.

         <title>An Organic Crystalline Ternary Pseudo&#8208;Heterojunction with Contrasting Luminescent and Mechanical Properties Prepared by Thermotropic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary pseudo&#8208;heterojunctions containing three organic polymorphs with distinct physical properties were prepared, which introduces new possibilities for integrating multiple functional phases within a single material system.







Abstract
Advancements in crystal engineering have enabled the precise tuning of the physical properties of organic crystals, thereby enhancing their potential in advanced optoelectronics. Here, we design an organic compound which crystallizes into distinct polymorphs with contrasting luminescent and mechanical behaviors. Controlled growth conditions yield flexible (Cry&#8208;O: orange fluorescence) and brittle (Cry&#8208;Y: yellow fluorescence) crystals which exhibit unique fluorescence shifts and reversible spectral changes between room and low temperatures, alongside unidirectional phase transitions upon thermal stimulation. The optical and mechanical differences between the polymorphs O and Y stem from their distinct molecular packing arrangements and intermolecular interactions. Notably, Cry&#8208;O undergoes sequential phase transitions upon heating to 98 and 132&#8201;&#176;C, enabling the creation of a ternary &#8220;pseudo&#8208;heterojunction&#8221; structure, facilitating the integration of multiple functional phases into a single material. These findings not only enhance the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of organic materials but also demonstrate the potential of polymorphism&#8208;driven property tuning for optoelectronic devices, thermal management systems, and optical sensors.

         <title>A Mechanochromic Rotaxane that Releases Azetidine&#8208;Trityl&#8208;Maleimide, a Versatile Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochromic rotaxane capable of releasing azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM), a new fluorescent probe displaying excellent optical properties (rigidochromic, large Stokes shift, solvent insensitive) and chemical stability (pH, nucleophiles, dienes), is presented. The mechanochemical generation of ATM is only possible with a rotaxane actuator, and this device should find applications in materials and biological science.







Abstract
Force sensing at the molecular level has enabled the study of materials failure and it offers great promises for the investigation of mechanobiological processes. Traditional force probes rely on the reversible or irreversible activation of mechanochromic precursors to assess transient or permanent changes in polymer networks. A promising approach involves force&#8208;controlled release of sensing molecules, as the accumulation of chromic molecules at specific sites would enable the recording of deformation histories. However, many fluorescent probes are limited by environmental sensitivity, specific release conditions, or low release efficiency. Maleimide&#8208;based dyes, especially amino maleimides, offer a robust alternative due to their small size, structural versatility, and tuneable fluorescence properties. Here, we present a mechanochromic rotaxane device that releases an azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM) fluorescent probe via a retro&#8208;[4+2] cycloaddition reaction. ATM is a rigidochromic, chemically stable, and environmentally insensitive probe, generated exclusively through rotaxane actuation, underscoring the unique mechanochemical properties of rotaxanes. This device holds potential for applications in material science and biology, such as the investigation of polymer networks and active tissues.

Maleimide-based dyes, especially amino maleimides, offer a robust alternative due to their small size, structural versatility, and tuneable fluorescence properties. Here, we present a mechanochromic rotaxane device that releases an azetidine-trityl-maleimide (ATM) fluorescent probe via a retro-[4+2] cycloaddition reaction. ATM is a rigidochromic, chemically stable, and environmentally insensitive probe, generated exclusively through rotaxane actuation, underscoring the unique mechanochemical properties of rotaxanes. This device holds potential for applications in material science and biology, such as the investigation of polymer networks and active tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Effective and Durable Integrated&#8208;Chainmail Electrode for H2 Production through H2S Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust integrated electrode that features a dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam is developed to enhance H2S electrolysis for green hydrogen production. The unique integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly improves both the activity and stability of the nickel foam. This chainmail electrodes realizes efficient hydrogen production at a high power of 224&#8197;W with 43&#8201;% electricity consumption reduction.







Abstract
H2S is a prevalent yet toxic gas commonly encountered during fossil fuel extraction, whose electrolysis not only addresses pollution concerns but also facilitates hydrogen production. However, the advancement of H2S electrolysis at high current density has been impeded by the lack of stable and highly active electrodes that can endure the corrosive effects of H2S poisoning. Herein, we present an integrated&#8208;chainmail electrode that features dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam (Ni@NC foam) to enhance H2S electrolysis. The electrode comprises a primary chainmail, formed by graphene coating on the surface of nickel foam, and a secondary chainmail, created by graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles. This integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly enhances both the activity and stability of nickel foam, which delivers an industrial&#8208;scale high current density exceeding 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, above five times higher than nickel foam. Moreover, the Ni@NC foam remains stable over 300&#8197;hours of test, demonstrating a lifespan at least ten times longer than nickel foam. In a demo for H2S removal from simulated natural gas, the Ni@NC foam as the electrodes exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 272&#8197;ml&#8201;min&#8722;1, while reducing electricity consumption by 43&#8201;% compared with traditional water electrolysis.

         <dc:description>
A novel and general synthetic strategy, incorporating ligand exchange, has been employed to design and synthesize metal&#8208;backboned molecules featuring various of metals. The synthesized metal&#8208;backboned molecules exhibiting intriguing optical characteristics, electronic band gaps and thermal properties. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of metal&#8208;backboned molecules with excellent properties.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been recently explored as a new class of materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties. However, their backbones are mainly composed of Ni atoms and poses challenges in incorporating a wide range of metallic elemental species, which has severely hindered their further development. Herein, we have designed a general synthesis strategy and obtained new metal&#8208;backboned molecules with a variety of metals including Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Pt in the backbones through a ligand&#8208;assisted strategy under screening reaction conditions. The metal backbone with seven Cu atoms has been carefully demonstrated for the synthesis. The intriguing optical properties, electronic band gaps and thermal properties for the metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been further explored. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;backboned molecule materials for promising applications in the future.
