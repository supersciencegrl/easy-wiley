      <title>Independent luminescent lifetime and intensity tuning of upconversion nanoparticles by gradient doping for multiplexed encoding</title>
      <dc:description>Multiplexed tools allow for simultaneous identification of multiple constituents in one preparation offering the rapid, high through&#8208;put method in modern biological analysis. Luminescent materials with engineered optical property have been developed for multiplexed labeling detection, where encoding capacity plays a pivotal role in the efficiency. However, multi&#8208;dimensional optical identities are usually not independent which essentially hinder the practical encoding numbers to access theoretical capacity. In this work, we carefully studied the sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and managed to achieve independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning. With the orthogonally tunability, it breaks the constraint of intensity (k) and lifetime (n) correlation and expands the practical encoding number to theoretical value as (k+1) n  &#8208;1 in binary encoding. This method can also be combined with previous lifetime engineering as well to realize high level multiplexing.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the In Situ Dissolution and Polymerization of Mo in Ni4Mo Alloy for Promoting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>NiMo alloys are efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolyzer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Metals are usually considered to be stable during the cathodic process. However, the actual behaviors of Mo in the NiMo alloys are unexplored. Here, we present the instability of Mo in the Ni  4  Mo alloy as a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. Our results reveal that Mo in Ni  4  Mo is oxidized and dissolved in the form of MoO  4  2&#8208;  first. The dissolved MoO  4  2&#8208;  will re&#8208;adsorb on the electrode surface and polymerize. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption of the dimer Mo  2  O  7  2&#8208;  can promote the HER activity of metal Ni. The addition of MoO  4  2&#8208;  to the electrolyte can not only repair the durability of Ni  4  Mo alloy, but also facilitate the HER activity of pure metal of Ni, Fe, and Co. Our findings provide a unique insight into the structural transformation mechanism and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of cathodic materials under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Although atomically precise metalloid nanoclusters (NCs) of identical size with distinctly different molecular structures are highly desirable to understand the structural effects on the intriguing optical and photophysical properties, their synthesis remains highly challenging.

      <dc:description>A rational design on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Numerous works have been devoted to understanding the cation leaching and surface reconstruction of some very active electrocatalysts, while few have been on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion.

      <title>Unveil Intrinsic Potassium Storage Behaviors of Hierarchical Nano Bi@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocages Framework via In Situ Characterizations</title>
      <dc:description>Recently, metallic bismuth has drawn enormous attentions as one promising alloying anode for advanced potassium ion batteries (PIBs), owing to its innate merits. However, serious volume expansion/electrode pulverization and sluggish kinetics always lead to its inferior cycling and rate properties for practical applications. Therefore, it is urgent yet meaningful to construct advanced Bi&#8208;based anodes via structural/compositional optimization and sur&#8208;/interface design. Herein, we first purposefully develop a bottom&#8208;up avenue to efficiently fabricate nanoscale Bi encapsulated in three&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (Bi@N&#8208;CNCs) framework with a void space by using a novel Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework as the precursor. With elaborate regulation in annealing temperatures, the optimized Bi@N&#8208;CNCs electrode exhibits large reversible capacities and long&#8208;duration cyclic stability at high rates when evaluated as competitive anodes for PIBs, benefiting from its unique structure/composition advantages. The in&#8208;depth insights into the intrinsic K+&#8208;storage processes of the Bi@N&#8208;CNCs anode are put forward with comprehensive in situ characterizations. More significantly, the methodology and understanding here hold enormous promise in rational design and versatile synthesis of multi&#8208;component Bi&#8208;based alloys as electrodes towards rechargeable batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

The in&#8208;depth insights into the intrinsic K+&#8208;storage processes of the Bi@N&#8208;CNCs anode are put forward with comprehensive in situ characterizations. More significantly, the methodology and understanding here hold enormous promise in rational design and versatile synthesis of multi&#8208;component Bi&#8208;based alloys as electrodes towards rechargeable batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Electrochemical Synthesis of Sulfonamides Directly from (Hetero)arenes, SO2 and Amines</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non&#8208;prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO2 and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP&#8208;MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides. In total, 36 examples are demonstrated with yields up to 85%.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ Construction of Robust Biphasic Surface Layers on Li Metal for Li&#8208;S Batteries with Long Cycle Life</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery show application prospect as a high energy density battery system. However, lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates can easily shuttle to Li anode and severely react with Li metal, which deplete the active materials and cause the rapid failure of batteries, remaining a great barrier for their practical application. Herein, a facile solution&#8208;pretreatment method for Li anodes with metal&#8208;fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide solution is developed to in situ construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs), which are consist of lithiophilic alloy (Li  x  M) and LiF phases on Li metal to efficiently inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li&#8208;S batteries.  The BSLs with good Li  +  transport ability and mechanical property can not only efficiently inhibit the dendrite growth, but also shield the Li anodes from the corrosion reaction with LiPSs. The Li&#8208;S batteries with such BSLs&#8208;Li anodes show the excellent cycling number over 1000 cycles at 1 C, and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2%. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, we propose a new  synergetic  mechanism  based on the robust BSLs and metal&#8208;S bond repulsion&#8208;space shield for inhibiting the shuttle effect, which is an efficient strategy for achieving high stability Li&#8208;S batteries and other metal battery systems.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven syngas production by CO  2  reduction provides a sustainable strategy to produce renewable feedstocks. However, this promising reaction often suffers from tough CO  2  activation, sluggish oxidative half&#8208;reaction kinetics and undesired by&#8208;products.

The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production  with tunable ratio  of CO/H  2  and efficient oxidation of  amine  s to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn  2  S  4  , as well as the  optimized adsorption strength for key  reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations.

In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using  PPY2  as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41% with a small  V  OC  loss (0.40 eV), among the best device performance for inverted PVSCs reported so far.

      <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidation of Organic Molecules by Multistep Electron Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>This review presents recent important homogenous aerobic oxidative reactions which are assisted by electron transfer mediators (ETMs). Compared with direct oxidation by molecular oxygen (O  2  ), the use of a coupled catalyst system with ETMs leads to a lower overall energy barrier via stepwise electron transfer. This cooperative catalytic process significantly facilitates the transport of electrons from the reduced form of the substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRC  red  ) to O  2  , thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. In this review, we have summarized the advances done in recent years in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed as well as metal&#8208;free aerobic oxidations of organic molecules in the presence of ETMs. In addition, the recent progress of photo and electricity&#8208;promoted oxidative functionalization using ETMs and O  2  as the terminal oxidant is also highlighted. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these transformations are showcased.</dc:description>

Ultra&#8208;long bottlebrush polymers were synthesized by Yoshihiro Yamauchi, Yasuhiro Ishida et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202009759) by using ring opening metathesis polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization. In the cover picture, the ultra&#8208;long bottlebrush polymers with different chemical properties are represented in four colors: blue, red, green, and yellow. A key to this achievement is based on the norbornene derivative as the starting material shown in the shining background.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Decorated Cuprous Oxide Nanowires for Long&#8208;lived Charges Applied in Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
      <dc:description>Improving the stability of cuprous oxide (Cu  2  O) is imperative to its practical applications in artificial photosynthesis. In this work, Cu  2  O nanowires are encapsulated by metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) of Cu  3  (BTC)  2  (BTC = 1,3,5&#8208;benzene tricarboxylate) using a surfactant&#8208;free method. Such MOFs not only suppress the water vapor&#8208;induced corrosion of Cu  2  O but also facilitate charge separation and CO  2  uptake, thus resulting in a nanocomposite representing 1.9 times improved activity and stability for selective photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction into methane (CH  4  ) under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of Cu  2  O to the LUMO level of non&#8208;excited Cu  3  (BTC)  2  has been evidenced by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence. This work proposes an effective strategy for CO  2  conversion by a synergy of charge separation and CO  2  adsorption, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic reaction when MOFs are integrated with metal oxide photocatalyst.</dc:description>

Bardeen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012417). A diolefinanthracene derivative undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization to generate molecular&#8208;scale motion. When microwires composed of this molecule are exposed to UV and Vis wavelengths, forward and reverse reactions drive continuous twisting and writhing. These motions can propel the wires at speeds controlled by the light intensity.

      <title>Photogenerated Holes Mediated Nitric Oxide Production for Hypoxic Tumor Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signal molecule with multiple physiological functions, and it also plays a key role in cancer therapy. However, the production of NO which depends on O  2  or H  2  O  2  is limited within the tumor microenvironment, leading to unsatisfactory anticancer effect. Herein, we report a NO&#8208;based phototherapeutic strategy mediated by photogenerated holes for hypoxic tumors, which is achieved by irradiation of the poly&#8208;L&#8208;arginine modified carbon&#8208;dots&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterial (ArgCCN). Upon red light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on ArgCCN oxidized water into H  2  O  2  which subsequently oxidized the arginine residues to produce NO. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the high concentration of NO produced by ArgCCN could induce cancer cell apoptosis. The presented phototherapeutic strategy is based on microenvironment&#8208;independent photogenerated holes mediated oxidation reaction, paving the way for the development of NO therapeutic strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the electrooxidation of urea: the intramolecular coupling of N&#8208;N bond</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for every organism and the nitrogen cycle is significant for human society. Nitrogenous nucleophile electrooxidation reaction (NOR) plays a vital role in the degradation and transformation of available nitrogen. Here, focusing on NOR based on &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)  2  electrode, we decipher the transformation mechanism of nitrogenous nucleophile. For two&#8208;step NOR, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the bridge between electrogenerated electrocatalyst dehydrogenation from &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)  2  to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)O and spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation reaction. This theory can give a good explanation for hydrazine and primary amine oxidation reactions, but is insufficient for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Through operando tracing bond rupture and formation processes during UOR and theoretical calculation, we propose the possible UOR mechanism that intramolecular coupling of N&#8208;N bond, accompanying with PCET, hydration and rearrangement processes, results in high&#8208;performance and ~100% N  2  &#8208;selectivity.

      <title>Poly(alkyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) ionomers and membranes with outstanding alkaline membrane fuel cell performance of 2.58 W cm&#8208;2</title>
      <dc:description>Aryl ether&#8208;free anion exchange ionomers (AEIs) and membranes (AEMs) have become an important benchmark to address the insufficient durability and power density issues associated with AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we present aliphatic chain&#8208;containing poly(diphenyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) (PDTP) copolymers to reduce the phenyl content and adsorption of AEIs and to increase the mechanical properties of AEMs. Specifically, PDTP AEMs possess excellent mechanical properties (storage modulus&gt;1,800 MPa, tensile strength&gt;70 MPa), H  2  &#160;fuel barrier properties (&lt;10 Barrer), good ion conductivity, and&#160;  ex&#8208;situ  &#160;stability. Meanwhile, PDTP AEIs with low phenyl content and high&#8208;water permeability display excellent peak power densities (PPDs). The present AEMFCs reach outstanding PPDs of 2.58 W cm  &#8208;2  &#160;(&gt; 7.6 A cm  &#8208;2&#160;  current density) and 1.38 W cm  &#8208;2  &#160;at 80&#160;  o  C in H  2  &#8208;O  2  &#160;and H  2  &#8208;air, respectively, along with a specific power (PPD/catalyst loading) over 8 W mg  &#8208;1  , which is the highest record&#160; for Pt&#8208;based AEMFCs &#160;so far.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent cell surface conjugation of nanoparticles by a combination of metabolic labelling and click chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Conjugation of nanoparticles (NP) to the surface of living cells is of interest in the context of exploiting the tissue homing properties of&#160;ex&#160;vivo engineered T cells for tumor targeted delivery of drugs loaded into NP. Cell surface conjugation requires either a covalent or non&#8208;covalent reaction. Non&#8208;covalent conjugation with ligand decorated NP is challenging and involves a dynamic equilibrium between the bound and unbound state. Covalent NP conjugation results in a permanently bound state of NP, but the current routes for cell surface conjugation face slow reaction kinetics and random conjugation to proteins in the glycocalyx. To address the unmet need for alternative bio&#8208;orthogonal strategies that allow for efficient covalent cell surface conjugation, we developed a 2&#8208;step click conjugation sequence in which cells are first metabolically labelled with azides followed by reaction with sulfo&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;dibenzyl cyclooctyne (Tz&#8208;DBCO) by SPAAC, and subsequent IEDDA with transcyclooctene (TCO) functionalized NP. In contrast to using only metabolic azide labelling and subsequent conjugation of DBCO&#8208;NP, our 2&#8208;step yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of LNP, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.</dc:description>

      <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;Crosslinked Porous Polymeric Networks for Micropollutant Removal from Water</title>
      <dc:description>Three calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P1&#8208;P3) have been prepared with the goal of removing organic micropollutants from water. A bowl&#8208;shaped &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a three&#8208;dimensional network polymer P1. This polymer, which proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent, was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative (polymer P3 containing carboxylate anion groups) through post&#8208;polymerization structural modification of the pendent tert&#8208;butyl esters. The anionic polymer P3 outperformed its precursor neutral polymer P2 as determined from screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality, including dyes, simple aromatics, and two cationic pesticides. Polymer P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P1&#8208;P3) have been prepared with the goal of removing organic micropollutants from water. A bowl&#8208;shaped &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a three&#8208;dimensional network polymer P1. This polymer, which proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent, was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative (polymer P3 containing carboxylate anion groups) through post&#8208;polymerization structural modification of the pendent tert&#8208;butyl esters. The anionic polymer P3 outperformed its precursor neutral polymer P2 as determined from screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality, including dyes, simple aromatics, and two cationic pesticides. Polymer P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants.

      <title>Surface functionalized sensors for humidity&#8208;independent gas detection</title>
      <dc:description>Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOXs) are used widely for gas sensors. However, the effect of ambient humidity on the baseline and sensitivity of chemiresistors is still a largely&#8208;unsolved problem, reducing sensor accuracy and causing complications for sensor calibrations. Here we present a general strategy to overcome water&#8208;sensitivity issues by coating SMOXs with a hydrophobic polymer separated by a metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) layer that preserves the SMOXs surface and acts as gas selective function. Sensor devices using these nanoparticles display near constant response even when humidity is varied across a wide range (0 to 90% relative humidity&#8208;RH). Furthermore, the sensor delivers notable performance below 20% RH where other water&#8208;resistance strategies typically fail. Selectivity enhancement and humidity&#8208;independent sensitivity are concomitantly achieved using this approach. The reported tandem coating strategy is expected to be relevant for a wide range of SMOXs, leading to a new generation of gas sensors with excellent humidity&#8208;resistant performance.</dc:description>

We report here an unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides catalyzed by 1 mol% of copper catalyst, and arrays of acrylamides were converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good to excellent enantioselectivities.

      <title>Locally ordered graphitized carbon cathodes for high&#8208;capacity dual&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density due to insufficient anion storage capacity of typical graphite cathodes. Herein, we propose a new design strategy to effectively tackle this issue via employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8208;anion repulsion and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interaction, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nano&#8208;graphite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8208;anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ketjen black (KB) with the typical feature of LOGC is selected as a model cathode for a potassium&#8208;based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 2000 mA g  &#8208;1  and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment, Experiment and Theory.</title>
      <dc:description>The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalates (POMs) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light harvesting units were examined. We evaluated in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. Our results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. This leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. We rationalize these results in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

      <title>Template&#8208;mediated control over polymorphism in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework powders and films</title>
      <dc:description>The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the synthesis outcome. In this work, we demonstrate how a template can enable such control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase; other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved  in situ  small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulted ZIF powders and films was studied by N  2  and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.</dc:description>

      <title>A Physical Entangling Strategy for Simultaneous Interior and Exterior Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Surface modification on metal&#8208;organic frameworks with no native reactive functional groups is challenging. We report a new strategy that utilizes a common feature of MOFs, porosity, rather than functionality, to achieve simultaneous interior and exterior modification of a MOF with polymers. Specifically, we demonstrate that an anhydride&#8208;terminated polyimide oligomer can be covalently grafted to the amine&#8208;functionalized methacrylate polymer backbone residing underneath the MOF surface and physically entangled within the 3&#8208;D nanochannels. Resultantly, the MOF particles were evenly coated with a thin layer of polyimide brushes on the surface thereby exhibiting increased dispersibility in solvent media as well as in polymer matrix. Meanwhile, the MOF pores were also decorated with aliphatic amine groups which endow the MOF with higher CO2  affinity at low pressure.&#160; The polyimide&#8208;grafted surface allowed MOF particles to interact favorably with the polyimide matrix thereby producing defect&#8208;free MMM with drastically improved CO2  permeability while largely maintaining the inherent CO2/N2  and CO2/CH4  selectivity of the neat polymeric membrane.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemistry of Tertiary Carbon Center in the Formation of Congested C&#8722;O Ether Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Cs2CO3 reaction system enables stereospecific reaction of functionalized tertiary alkyl bromides and bulky alcohols. The reaction occurred with retention of configuration.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions, including SN1 and SN2, are classical and reliable reactions, but a serious drawback is their intolerance for both bulky nucleophiles and chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles for the synthesis of a chiral quaternary carbon center. An SRN1 reaction via a radical species is another conventional method used to carry out substitution reactions of bulky nucleophiles and alkyl halides, but chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles cannot be used. Therefore, a stereospecific nucleophilic substitution reaction using chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles and bulky nucleophiles has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we describe the reaction of tertiary alkyl alcohols and non&#8208;chiral or chiral &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as a tertiary alkyl source for the formation of congested ether compounds possessing two different tertiary alkyl groups on the oxygen atom with stereoretention.

      <title>Probing the Consequences of Cubic Particle Shape and Applied Field on Colloidal Crystal Engineering with DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Assembly of magnetic nanoparticles results from a competition between dipole and surface interactions. To modulate these forces, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with DNA to explore the assembly behavior in a magnetic field. X&#8208;ray scattering elucidates that orientation is controlled across length scales due to the altered arrangement of particles.







Abstract
In a magnetic field, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit assembly behavior that is a consequence of a competition between magnetic dipole&#8211;dipole and ligand interactions. In most cases, the interactions between short hydrophobic ligands dominate and dictate assembly outcome. To better tune the face&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with DNA. Their assembly behaviors were investigated both with and without an applied magnetic field. Upon application of a field, the tilted orientation of cubes, enabled by the flexible DNA ligand shell, led to an unexpected crystallographic alignment of the entire superlattice, as opposed to just the individual particles, along the field direction as revealed by small and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This observation is dependent upon DNA length and sequence and cube dimensions. Taken together, these studies show how combining physical and chemical control can expand the possibilities of crystal engineering with DNA.

      <title>Coplanar Pt/C Nanomeshes with Ultrastable Oxygen Reduction Performance toward Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction is of great importance for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells but still challenging. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05 &#177; 0.72 nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21 W cm  &#8722;2  and current density of 0.360 A cm  &#8722;2  at 0.80 V in H  2  /O  2  cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation with nanomesh structures preserved intact in a long&#8208;term operation over 30,000 cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120 h in H  2  /O  2  single cell operation. Density functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting CO2 Electrochemical Reduction with Atomically Precise Surface Modification on Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters are promising catalytic materials for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2RR), and their atomically precise size and structure as well as tunable composition render such materials particularly useful in fundamental studies. In this work we investigate CO2RR through an atomic level modification on a Au23 nanocluster by substituting two surface gold atoms with two cadmium (Cd) atoms. Such a modification of the surface structure greatly enhances the CO2RR selectivity to 90% &#8208; 95% at the applied potential between &#8208;0.5 V to &#8208;0.9 V, which is doubled compared with that of the undoped Au23. Additionally, when compared to the reported nanoclusters, the Cd&#8208;doped Au19Cd2 nanocluster exhibits the highest CO2RR activity (with 2200 mA mg&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). This unique synergetic effect between Au and Cd is remarkable. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposure of a sulfur active site upon partial ligand removal from the cluster surface provides an energetically feasible CO2RR reaction pathway. The thermodynamic energy barrier for product (CO) formation is 0.74 eV lower on the Au19Cd2 nanocluster compared to the Au23 nanocluster. The consistent experimental observation and calculation results reveal that Cd doping can greatly boost the CO2RR performance of Au nanoclusters by modifying both the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of CO2RR and bimetallic synergism.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of 1,4&#8208;Azaborine Derivatives as Models of BN&#8208;doped PAHs</title>
      <dc:description>The single&#8211;molecule conductance of a series of BN&#8208;acene&#8208;like derivatives has been measured by using scanning tunneling break&#8208;junction techniques. A strategic design of the target molecules has allowed us to include azaborine units in positions that unambiguously ensure electron transport through both heteroatoms, which is relevant for the development of customized BN&#8208;doped nanographenes. We show that the conductance of the anthracene azaborine derivative is comparable to that of the pristine all&#8208;carbon anthracene compound. Notably, this heteroatom substitution has also allowed us to perform similar measurements on the corresponding pentacene&#8208;like compound, which is found to have a similar conductance, thus evidencing that B&#8211;N doping could also be used to stabilize and characterize larger acenes for molecular electronics applications. Our conclusions are supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral  lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskites for self&#8208;powered circularly polarized light detection</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are recently emerging as the promising alternative for CPL detection owing to their CPL&#8208;sensitive property induced by chiral organics and efficient charge transport of inorganic frameworks.

Circular dichroism measurements reveal that these perovskites exhibit notable chirality induced by organic cations to distinguish different polarization states of CPL photons. Significantly, they present unique chiral polar photovoltaic, and resulting self&#8208;powered CPL detection without an external power source is unprecedentedly achieved. Furthermore, an anisotropy factor up to 0.3 is acquired for the self&#8208;powered CPL detection, reaching the highest value among reported chiral perovskites.

      <title>A ligand selection strategy identifies chemical probes targeting the proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
      <dc:description>Activity&#8208;based probes are valuable tools for chemical biology. However, finding probes that specifically target the active site of an enzyme remains a challenging task. Here we present a ligand selection strategy that allows to rapidly tailor electrophilic probes to a target of choice and showcase its application for the two cysteine proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as proof of concept. The resulting probes were specific for the active site labelling of 3CL  pro  and PL  pro  with sufficient selectivity in a live cell model as well as in the background of a native human proteome. Exploiting the probes as tools for competitive profiling of a natural product library identified salvianolic acid derivatives as promising 3CL  pro  inhibitors. We anticipate that our ligand selection strategy will be useful to rapidly develop customized probes and discover inhibitors for a wide range of target proteins also beyond corona virus proteases.</dc:description>

      <title>A Pseudotetrahedral Terminal Oxoiron(IV) Complex: Mechanistic Promiscuity in C&#8208;H bond Oxidation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>S=2 oxoiron(IV) species act as reactive intermediates in the catalytic cycle of nonheme iron oxygenases. The few available synthetic  S  =2 Fe  IV  &#9552;O complexes known to date are often limited to trigonal bipyramidal and very rarely to octahedral geometries. Herein we describe the generation and characterization of an  S  =2 pseudotetrahedral Fe  IV  &#9552;O complex  2  supported by the sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand.  2  is a very potent oxidant in hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactions with large non&#8208;classical deuterium kinetic isotope effects, suggesting hydrogen tunneling contributions. For sterically encumbered substrates, direct HAA is impeded and an alternative oxidative asynchronous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism prevails, which is unique within the nonheme oxoiron community. The high reactivity and the similar spectroscopic parameters make  2  one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;  J  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Potent trivalent inhibitors of thrombin through hybridization of salivary sulfopeptides from hematophagous arthropods</title>
      <dc:description>Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one&#8208;pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against &#945;&#8208;thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation  in vitro  and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1 mg kg  &#8208;1  . The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein&#8208;protein interactions, in addition to an active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Oxythiophosphate Approaching the Good Balance with Wide Ultraviolet Transparency, Strong Second Harmonic Effect and Large Birefringence</title>
      <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH2PO4, the oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203 nm), strong SHG effect (~ 0.89 pm/V), and large birefringence (~ 0.10 at 1064 nm) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (~ 214 nm).</dc:description>

      <title>Pt/MnO2 Nanoflowers Anchored to Boron Nitride Aerogels for Highly Efficient Enrichment and Catalytic Oxidation of Formaldehyde at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic room temperature oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) is widely considered as a viable method for the abatement of indoor toxic HCHO pollution. Herein, Pt/MnO  2  nanoflowers anchored to boron nitride aerogels (Pt/MnO  2  &#8208;BN) were fabricated for the catalytic room temperature oxidation of HCHO. The three&#8208;dimensional Pt/MnO  2  &#8208;BN aerogels demonstrated superior catalytic activity as a result of the improved diffusion of the reactant molecules within the porous structure. Furthermore, the porous aerogels displayed excellent HCHO adsorption capacities, which promote a rapid HCHO gas&#8208;phase concentration reduction and a subsequent complete oxidation of the adsorbed HCHO. The combined adsorption and oxidation properties of the Pt/MnO  2  &#8208;BN aerogels synergistically enhance the oxidative removal of HCHO. The optimized Pt/MnO  2  &#8208;BN demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward HCHO (200 ppm) at room temperature, achieving a 96% formaldehyde conversion after 50 min.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by elaborately dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. It is found that the irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO  6  ] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO  6  ] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence.
