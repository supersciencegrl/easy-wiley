         <title>Near Ultraviolet&#8208;Excitable Cyan&#8208;Emissive Hybrid Copper(I) Halides Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and High&#8208;Efficiency X&#8208;ray Scintillation</title>

         <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt; 500 nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P = methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475 nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8210; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8210; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495 nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450 nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54 &#215; KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064 nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5 &#956;Gy/s). This work not only promotes the development of solid&#8208;state lighting, laser frequency conversion and X&#8208;ray imaging, but also provides a reference for constructing multifunctional hybrid metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Enriched Alginate&#8211;Graphene Hydrogel Microreactor for Enhanced Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient synthesis of H2O2 via photocatalytic oxygen reduction without sacrificial agents is challenging due to inadequate proton supply from water and difficulty in maintaining O&#8722;O bond during O2 activation. Herein, we developed a straightforward strategy involving a proton&#8208;rich hydrogel cross&#8208;linked by metal ions [M(n)], which is designed to facilitate the selective production of H2O2 through proton relay and metal ion&#8208;assisted detachment of crucial intermediates. The hydrogel comprises CdS/graphene and alginate cross&#8208;linked by metal ions via O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds. Efficient O2 reduction and hydrogenation occurred, benefitting from the collaboration between proton&#8208;rich alginate and the photocatalytically active CdS/graphene. Meanwhile, the O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds enhance the electron density of &#945;&#8208;carbon sites on graphene, crucial for O2 activation and *OOH intermediate detachment, preventing deeper O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The role of metal ions in promoting *OOH desorption was evident through Lewis acidity&#8208;dependent activity, with Y(III) demonstrating the highest activity followed by Lu(III), La(III), and Ca(II).</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Selective Selenium&#8208;catalyzed Allylic C&#8208;H Amination of Enol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free Se&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H amination protocol for &#945;&#8217;&#8208;amination of enol derivatives has been developed. This reaction can be used to functionalize a wide variety of oxygen&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted alkenes spanning a vast range of nucleophilicities, giving &#945;&#8217;&#8208;aminated enol derivatives with high regioselectivity. Amination of E/Z mixtures of alkenes proceeds stereoconvergently to give the (Z)&#8208;enol derivatives exclusively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the relative reactivity and &#945;&#8217;&#8208;regioselectivity of these transformations is determined by substantial resonance donation to the heteroatom&#8208;bound carbon in the transition state. These products participate in traditional reactions of enol derivatives, allowing for efficient functionalization of both &#945;&#8208; and &#945;&#8217;&#8208;positions from a single enol derivative with high diastereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Cellular Vesicles Displaying Glycosylated Nanobodies for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis represents an alluring avenue for cancer immunotherapy. However, the compromised efficacy and safety concerns in vivo of conventional anti&#8208;CD47 antibodies impede their wide clinical applications. Here we introduced a single type of high&#8208;mannose glycans into the nanobodies against CD47 (HM&#8208;nCD47) and subsequently displayed HM&#8208;nCD47 on cellular vesicles (CVs) for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. In this platform, the CVs significantly improved the circulation time of HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs, the nCD47 enabled the blockade of the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis, and the HM enhanced recognition of mannose&#8208;binding lectin, all synergistically activating the macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. In both subcutaneous and metastatic murine tumor models, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs possessed significantly extended half&#8208;lives and increased accumulation at the tumor site, resulting in a remarkable macrophage&#8208;dependent inhibition of tumor growth, a transcriptomic remodeling of the immune response, and an increase in survival time. By integrating the chemical biology toolbox with cell membrane nanotechnology, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs represent a new immunotherapeutic platform for cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate&#160;Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid headgroup. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Transition between Multiple Conductance States and Rectifying Behaviors in an Artificial Single&#8208;Molecule Funnel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has long been an aspirational goal to create artificial channel structures that replicate the feat achieved by ion channel proteins. Biological ion channels occasionally demonstrate multiple conductance states (known as subconductance), remaining a challenging property to achieve in artificial channel molecules. We report a funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. Planar lipid bilayer measurements reveal distinct current recordings, including a closed state, two conducting states, and spontaneous transitions between the three states, resembling the events seen in biological ion channels. The transitions result from conformational changes induced by chloride transport in the channel molecule. Both opening states show a non&#8208;linear and rectifying I&#8208;V relationship, indicating voltage&#8208;dependent transport due to the asymmetrical channel structure. This work could enhance our understanding of ion permeation and channel opening mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Triply Interlocked [2]catenanes: Rational Synthesis, Reversible Conversion Studies and Unprecedented Application in Photothermal Responsive Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triply interlocked [2]catenane exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance was constructed and used as photothermal units in the creation of light&#8208;driven, versatile soft actuators within thermal stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Triply interlocked [2]catenane complexes featuring two identical, mechanically interlocked units are extraordinarily rare chemical compounds, whose properties and applications remain open to detailed studies. Herein, we introduce the rational design of a new ligand precursor, L1, suitable for the synthesis of six triply interlocked [2]catenanes by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The interlocked compounds can be reversibly converted into the corresponding simple triangular prism metallacage by addition of H2O or DMF solvents to their CH3OH solutions, thereby demonstrating the importance of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions in the formation of triply interlocked [2]catenanes. Moreover, extensive studies have been conducted to assess the remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Complex 6&#8201;a, exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance (conversion efficiency in solution : 31.82&#8201;%), is used to prepare novel photoresponsive elastomer in combination with thermally activated liquid crystal elastomer. The resultant material displays robust response to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser and the capability of completely reforming the shape and reversible actuation, paving the way for the application of half&#8208;sandwich organometallic units in photo&#8208;responsive smart materials.

         <title>Inside Cover Picture: Modulating the Electrolyte Microenvironment in Electrical Double Layer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally regulating the electrolyte microenvironment is an effective approach to boost the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance. In their Research Article (e202408382), Xin&#8208;Yao Yu and co&#8208;workers propose a novel strategy to enhance the NO3RR performance by mediating alkali metal cations in the electrolyte. In the presence of K+, the protons are more favorable to cross the electric double layer to reach the catalyst surface and conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; is promoted, thereby favoring the overall kinetics of NO3RR.

         <title>3D Lead&#8208;Organoselenide&#8208;Halide Perovskites and their Mixed&#8208;Chalcogenide and Mixed&#8208;Halide Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We incorporate Se into the 3D halide perovskite framework using the zwitterionic ligand: SeCYS (+NH3(CH2)2Se&#8722;), which occupies both the X&#8722; and A+ sites in the prototypical ABX3 perovskite. The new organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites: (SeCYS)PbX2 (X = Cl, Br) expand upon the recently discovered organosulfide&#8208;halide perovskites. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis reveal the average structures of the organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites, whereas the local lead coordination environments and their distributions were probed through solid&#8208;state 77Se and 207Pb NMR, complemented by theoretical simulations. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the band structures of (SeCYS)PbX2 largely resemble those of their S analogs, with similar band dispersion patterns, yet with a considerable bandgap decrease. Optical absorbance measurements indeed show bandgaps of 2.07 and 1.86 eV for (SeCYS)PbX2 with X = Cl and Br, respectively. We further demonstrate routes to alloying the halides (Cl, Br) and chalcogenides (S, Se) continuously tuning the bandgap from 1.86 to 2.31 eV&#8212;straddling the ideal range for tandem solar cells or visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The comprehensive description of the average and local structures, and how they can fine&#8208;tune the bandgap and potential trap states, respectively, establishes the foundation for understanding this new perovskite family, which combines solid&#8208;state and organo&#8208;main&#8208;group chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40 s&#8208;1 respectively, 8.6 times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8208;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic Ion Barrier&#8208;Enabled Ultradurable Zn (002) Plane Orientation towards Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Less Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gradual disability of Zn anode and high negative/positive electrode (N/P) ratio usually depreciate calendar life and energy density of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, within original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes, a steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating to solve this issue. Guided by theoretical simulations, hydrophobic adiponitrile (ADN) is employed as a steric hindrance agent to ally with inert electric field shielding additive (Mn2+) for plane adsorption priority manipulation, thereby constructing the &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221;. This design robustly suppresses the (002) plane/dendrite growth, enabling ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating. Even being cycled in Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cell over 2150 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, the efficacy remains well&#8208;kept. Additionally, Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cells can be also stably cycled over 918 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, verifying uncompromised Zn stripping/plating kinetics. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#183;2H2O full cells with a low N/P ratio (2:1) show a high energy density of 75.2 Wh kg&#8208;1full electrode after 842 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, far surpassing counterparts with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass, featuring excellent practicality. This study opens a new avenue by robust &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; design to develop long&#8208;life anode&#8208;less Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Enabled Droplet Biobattery for Powering Synthetic Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;enabled biobatteries are promising green options to power the next&#8208;generation of bioelectronics and implantable medical devices. However, existing power sources based on enzymatic biofuel chemistry exhibit limited scale&#8208;down feasibility due to the solid and bulky battery structures. Therefore, miniature and soft alternatives are needed for integration with implants and tissues. Here, a biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. Optimization of the droplet biobattery components ensures a stable output current of ~13,000 pA for over 24 h, representing a more than 600&#8208;fold increase in output over previous approaches, including light&#8208;driven processes. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive electrochemical signal transmission in integrated synthetic tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Se&#8208;Elemental Concentration Gradient Regulation for Efficient Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3), featuring large absorption coefficient, excellent crystal structure stability, benign non&#8208;toxic characteristic, outstanding humidity and ultraviolet tolerability, has recently attracted enormous attention and research interest regarding its photoelectric conversion properties. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) for Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is relatively low, especially for the device with a high power conversion efficiency (&#951;). Herein, an innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited to produce high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films on TiO2/CdS substrates through a thioacetamide(TA)&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source hydrothermal&#8208;processed method. The Se&#8208;elemental gradient distribution produces a favorable energy band structure, which suppresses the energy level barriers for hole transport and enhances the driving force for electron transport in Sb2(S,Se)3 film. This facilitates efficient charge transport/separation of photogenerated carriers and boosts significantly the Voc of Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaic devices. The champion TA&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cell displays an considerable &#951; of 9.28% accompanied by an exciting&#160;Voc rising to 0.70 V that is currently the highest among Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 9.0%. This research is anticipated to contribute to the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film and the achievement of efficient inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ photovoltaic device.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via Heterogeneous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogenous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143 times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON)&#160;the heterogeneous gallium (III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium (III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8208;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8208;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8208;CN, &#8208;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Acidity Regulation Enhances Electrocatalytic Performances of Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local acidity at the anode surface during electrolysis is apparently stronger than that in bulk electrolyte due to the deprotonation from the reactant, which leads to the deteriorated electrocatalytic performances and product distributions. Here, an anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial acidity regulation strategy has been proposed to inhibit local acidification at the surface of anode and enhance the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of anodic reactions. As a proof of the concept, CeO2&#8208;x Lewis acid component has been employed as a supporter to load Au nanoparticles to accelerate the diffusion and enrichment of OH&#8208; toward the anode surface, so as to accelerate the electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation reaction. As the result, Au/CeO2&#8208;x exhibits much enhanced lactic acid selectivity of 81% and electrochemical activity of 693 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 current density in glycerol oxidation reaction compared to pure Au. Mechanism investigation reveals that the introduced Lewis acid promotes the mass transport and concentration of OH&#8208; on the anode surface, thus promoting the generation of lactic acid through the simultaneous enhancements of Faradaic and non&#8208;Faradaic processes. Attractively, the proposed strategy can be used for the electro&#8208;oxidation performance enhancements of a variety of alcohols, which thereby provides a new perspective for efficient alcohol electro&#8208;oxidations and the corresponding electrocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Versatile Synthesis of Thioamides by Radical Thiocarbamoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37 A&#183;mgpt&#8208;1 along with excellent stability during a 24 h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enable the Domino&#8208;Like Structural Recovering in Bismuth Anode to Achieve Fast and Durable Na/K Storages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk inlaid architecture with bismuth nanospheres enclosed in an N&#8208;doped bulk carbon (BiNC). Such a structure can enable the reversible Na3Bi&#8596;layered Bi phase transition triggered by the compressive stress&#8208;induced &#8220;domino&#8221; effect, thus suppress the irreversible structural evolutions to achieve an extraordinary cyclic stability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type anodes show capacity and density advantages for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs), but they encounter serious structural degradation upon cycling, which cannot be resolved through conventional nanostructuring techniques. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying, and report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume&#8208;expansion&#8208;resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction, and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10&#8201;%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a &#8220;domino&#8208;like&#8221; Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for SIBs, 848.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3&#8201;% for SIBs, 96.4&#8201;% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000&#8197;cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015&#8201;% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work provides new insights on the undesirable structural evolution, and proposes basic guidelines for design of the anti&#8208;degradation structure for alloy&#8208;type electrode materials.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Ultrafast Construction of Zinc Tungstate Interface Layer for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zincophilic ZnWO4 layer has been ultrafast in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (ZWO@Zn) by a facile solution reaction. The ZWO@Zn can effectively eliminate the zinc dendrites and side reactions by regulating interfacial electric field distribution and promoting the uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Constructing artificial solid electrolyte interface on the Zn anode surface is recognized as an appealing method to inhibit zinc dendrites and side reactions, whereas the current techniques are complex and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a robust and zincophilic zinc tungstate (ZnWO4) layer has been in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (denoted as ZWO@Zn) by an ultrafast chemical solution reaction. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ZWO layer can effectively modulate the interfacial electric field distribution and promote the Zn2+ uniform diffusion, thus facilitating the uniform Zn2+ nucleation and suppressing zinc dendrites. Besides, ZWO layer can prevent direct contact between the Zn/water and increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to eliminate side reactions. Consequently, the in situ constructed ZWO layer facilitates remarkable reversibility in the ZWO@Zn||Ti battery, achieving an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.36&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, unprecedented cycling lifespan exceeding 1800&#8197;h under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in ZWO@Zn||ZWO@Zn battery, and a steady and reliable operation of the overall ZWO@Zn||VS2 battery. The work provides a simple, low cost, and ultrafast pathway to crafting protective layers for driving advancements in aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>A Luminescent Hybrid Bimetallic Halide Family with Solvent&#8208;Coordinated Rare Earth and Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new family of 21&#8197;hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A = rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L = solvent ligand; B = Sb, Bi and Te), demonstrating high compositional and structural diversity. These materials have high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) attributed to the triplet radiative recombination from Sb or the emission of the RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a PLQY of 94&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are an extraordinary class of optoelectronic materials with extensive applications. To further diversify and study the in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property relations, we report here a new family of 21 zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A=rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L=solvent ligand; and B=Sb, Bi and Te). The RE(DMSO)8[BCl6] (RE=La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide) series shows broadband emission attributed to triplet radiative recombination from Sb and Bi, incorporating the characteristic emission of RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a staggering PL quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The pseudo&#8208;octahedral [SbCl5] with Cl vacancy in AII(DMSO)6[SbCl5] (AII=Mg, Ca and Mn) and the square pyramidal [SbCl5] in AII(TMSO)6[SbCl5] (TMSO=tetramethylene sulfoxide) enhance the stereoactive expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs of Sb3+, giving rise to the observation of dual&#8208;band emission of singlet and triplet emission, respectively. A series of Te(IV) analogues have been characterized, showing blue&#8208;light&#8208;excitable single&#8208;band emission. This work expands the materials space for hybrid bimetallic halides with an emphasis on harnessing the RE elements, and provides important insights into designing new emitters and regulating their properties.

To further diversify and study the in-depth structure-property relations, we report here a new family of 21 zero-dimensional hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;=rare earth (&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;), alkaline earth metals and Mn; &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;=solvent ligand; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;=Sb, Bi and Te). The &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;=La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide) series shows broadband emission attributed to triplet radiative recombination from Sb and Bi, incorporating the characteristic emission of &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt; metals, where Eu(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[BiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] shows a staggering PL quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The pseudo-octahedral [SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] with Cl vacancy in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;=Mg, Ca and Mn) and the square pyramidal [SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(TMSO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] (TMSO=tetramethylene sulfoxide) enhance the stereoactive expression of the 5&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone pairs of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, giving rise to the observation of dual-band emission of singlet and triplet emission, respectively. A series of Te(IV) analogues have been characterized, showing blue-light-excitable single-band emission. This work expands the materials space for hybrid bimetallic halides with an emphasis on harnessing the &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt; elements, and provides important insights into designing new emitters and regulating their properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Dependent Dual&#8208;Phosphorescent Cu4 Nanocluster with Remarkable Piezochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressure, for the first time, was introduced into the atomically precise coinage metal copper(I) nanocluster [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) with intrinsic dual emission (DE) behavior to investigate the origin of DE phenomena. We observed interesting pressure&#8208;dependent optical variations and obvious piezochromism. This research provides a theoretical reference for designing novel DE materials in the future.







Abstract
The dual emission (DE) characteristics of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) are of significant theoretical and practical interest. Despite this, the underlying mechanism driving DE in Cu NCs remains elusive, primarily due to the complexities of excited state processes. Herein, a novel [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) NC, shielded by alkynyl and exhibiting DE, was synthesized. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to Cu4, for the first time, to investigate the mechanism of DE. With increasing pressure, the higher&#8208;energy emission peak of Cu4 gradually disappeared, leaving the lower&#8208;energy emission peak as the dominant emission. Additionally, the Cu4 crystal exhibited notable piezochromism transitioning from cyan to orange. Angle&#8208;dispersive synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction results revealed that the reduced inter&#8208;cluster distances under pressure brought the peripheral ligands closer, leading to the formation of new C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds in Cu4. It is proposed that these strengthened hydrogen bond interactions limit the ligands&#8242; vibration, resulting in the vanishing of the higher&#8208;energy peak. In situ high&#8208;pressure Raman and vibrationally resolved emission spectra demonstrated that the benzene ring C=C stretching vibration is the structural source of the DE in Cu4.

         <title>Understanding Spin&#8208;Triplet Excited States in Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides (CMAs) are emerging delayed fluorescence emitters with unusual photophysics and open questions involving the nature and population of non&#8208;emissive triplets. We have combined time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations to establish a direct experimental handle for characterizing populated spin&#8208;triplet excitations in benchmark coinage metal CMAs through excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) signatures. Polarity&#8208;induced population/ESA shifts match well between experiments and calculations.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amides (CMAs) are emerging delayed fluorescence materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications. CMAs possess fast, efficient emission owing to rapid forward and reverse intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The resulting dynamic equilibrium between singlet and triplet spin manifolds distinguishes CMAs from most purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters. However, direct experimental triplet characterization in CMAs is underutilized, limiting our detailed understanding of the ISC mechanism. In this work, we combine time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy with tuning of state energies through environmental polarity and metal substitution, focusing on the interplay between charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) and local exciton (3LE) triplets. Unlike previous photophysical work, we investigate evaporated host&#8201;:&#8201;guest films of CMAs and small&#8208;molecule hosts for increased device relevance. Transient absorption reveals an evolution in the triplet excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) consistent with a change in orbital character between hosts with differing dielectric constants. Using quantum chemical calculations, we simulate ESAs of the lowest triplet states, highlighting the contribution of only 3CT and donor&#8208;moiety 3LE states to spectral features, with no strong evidence for a low&#8208;lying acceptor&#8208;centered 3LE. Thus, our work provides a blueprint for understanding the role of triplet excited states in CMAs which will enable further intelligent optimization of this promising class of materials.

         <title>Deep Red Light Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Heterojunction Polymer Dots for Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact heterojunction polymer dots act as a remarkable H2&#8208;production system in response to deep red light illumination. Hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) at the inflammatory tissues were selectively scavenged by H2, therefore accelerating the healing process of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
We describe small heterojunction polymer dots (Pdots) with deep&#8208;red light catalyzed H2 generation for diabetic skin wound healing. The Pdots with donor/acceptor heterojunctions showed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the donor or acceptor nanoparticles alone. We encapsulate the Pdots and ascorbic acid into liposomes to form Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors, which selectively scavenge &#8901;OH radicals in live cells and tissues under 650&#8197;nm light illumination. The antioxidant capacity of the heterojunction Pdots is ~10&#8197;times higher than that of the single&#8208;component Pdots described previously. Under a total light dose of 360&#8197;J/cm2, the Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors effectively scavenged &#8901;OH radicals and suppressed the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in skin tissues, thereby accelerating the healing of skin wounds in diabetic mice. This study provides a feasible solution for safe and effective treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

         <title>Unnatural Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Enabled by Living Cell&#8208;Cell Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seamless connection between different bacterial species was achieved by living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry, enabling the establishment of an unnatural C&#8208;type cytochrome based direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway. The process resulted in an unprecedented interspecies electron transfer pathway shift for highly efficient interspecies electron exchange and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration, understanding, and engineering.







Abstract
Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is essential for maintaining the function and stability of anaerobic microbial consortia. However, only limited natural DIET modes have been identified and DIET engineering remains highly challenging. In this study, an unnatural DIET between Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 (SO, electron donating partner) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RP, electron accepting partner) was artificially established by a facile living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry strategy. By introducing alkyne&#8208; or azide&#8208;modified monosaccharides onto the cell outer surface of the target species, precise covalent connections between different species in high proximity were realized through a fast click chemistry reaction. Remarkably, upon covalent connection, outer cell surface C&#8208;type cytochromes mediated DIET between SO and RP was achieved and identified, although this was never realized naturally. Moreover, this connection directly shifted the natural H2 mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) to DIET between SO and RP, which delivered superior interspecies electron exchange efficiency.

     alt="Unnatural Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Enabled by Living Cell-Cell Click Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seamless connection between different bacterial species was achieved by living cell-cell click chemistry, enabling the establishment of an unnatural C-type cytochrome based direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway. The process resulted in an unprecedented interspecies electron transfer pathway shift for highly efficient interspecies electron exchange and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration, understanding, and engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is essential for maintaining the function and stability of anaerobic microbial consortia. However, only limited natural DIET modes have been identified and DIET engineering remains highly challenging. In this study, an unnatural DIET between &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; MR-1 (&lt;i&gt;SO&lt;/i&gt;, electron donating partner) and &lt;i&gt;Rhodopseudomonas palustris&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;RP&lt;/i&gt;, electron accepting partner) was artificially established by a facile living cell-cell click chemistry strategy. By introducing alkyne- or azide-modified monosaccharides onto the cell outer surface of the target species, precise covalent connections between different species in high proximity were realized through a fast click chemistry reaction. Remarkably, upon covalent connection, outer cell surface C-type cytochromes mediated DIET between &lt;i&gt;SO&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RP&lt;/i&gt; was achieved and identified, although this was never realized naturally. Moreover, this connection directly shifted the natural H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) to DIET between &lt;i&gt;SO&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RP&lt;/i&gt;, which delivered superior interspecies electron exchange efficiency. Therefore, this work demonstrated a naturally unachievable DIET and an unprecedented MIET shift to DIET accomplished by cell-cell distance engineering, offering an efficient and versatile solution for DIET engineering, which extends our understanding of DIET and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N2 Functionalization via Molybdenum&#8208;Nitride Complex: Stepwise BH Bond Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of the Mo&#8801;N bond of a [(PPP)Mo(N)I] complex, which is obtained by N2 splitting, reveals guiding principles to N2 splitting and functionalization to give amine derivatives. The reaction of the N at a Mo center with BH bonds depends on the R2BH reagent.







Abstract
Reactivity of (triphosphine)MoIV&#8208;nitrido complex generated by N2 splitting, toward boranes is reported. The simple adduct Mo&#8801;N&#8594;BH3 is observed with BH3.SMe2 while 1,2 addition is evidenced with 9&#8208;BBN leading to H&#8722;Mo=NBR2. A second addition of BH3.SMe2 is facile and forms an unprecedented complex featuring two bridging H between two B and the Mo centers. Addition of PMe3 or BH3.SMe2 promotes reductive elimination and N&#8722;H bond formation. The full sequence of functionalization at Mo&#8801;N obtained after N2 splitting is therefore evidenced in this work.

         <title>Tailoring Electric Double Layer by Cation Specific Adsorption for High&#8208;Voltage Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A positively&#8208;charged polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is constructed by the preferential adsorption of 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations on high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process.







Abstract
The interfacial instability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxides severely plagues practical application of high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a uniform and highly oxidation&#8208;resistant polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is engineered by in situ polymerizing 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations preferentially adsorbed on LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM83) surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the copolymerization of [VEIM][BF4] and vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC) endows P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer with the positively&#8208;charged imidazolium moieties, providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process. Consequently, the Li||NCM83 cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V exhibit excellent reversible capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C and considerable discharge capacity of 134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 without capacity decay after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides deep understanding on tailoring electric double layer by cation specific adsorption for high&#8208;voltage quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Novel Photocatalyst Based on Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Induced Intersystem Crossing Enables Rapid and Efficient Polymerization Under Low&#8208;Power Excitation Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the novel strategy of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC), a photocatalyst (NI&#8208;1) with the properties of satisfactory ISC efficiency, long triplet lifetime and robust excited state reduction ability was obtained. This photocatalyst was used in polymerization/ lithography, an efficient and fast polymerization was achieved under the conditions of low power excitation and without electron donor.







Abstract
Currently, most photoredox catalysis polymerization systems are limited by high excitation power, long polymerization time, or the requirement of electron donors due to the precise design of efficient photocatalysts still poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach: the creation of efficient photocatalysts having low ground state oxidation potentials and high excited state energy levels, along with through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC) properties. A cabazole&#8208;naphthalimide (NI) dyad (NI&#8208;1) characterized by long triplet excited state lifetime (&#964;T=62&#8197;&#956;s), satisfactory ISC efficiency (&#934;&#916;=54.3&#8201;%) and powerful reduction capacity [Singlet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;1.93&#8197;eV, Triplet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;0.84&#8197;eV] was obtained. An efficient and rapid polymerization (83&#8201;% conversion of 1&#8197;mM monomer in 30&#8197;s) was observed under the conditions of without electron donor, low excitation power (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low catalyst (NI&#8208;1) loading (&lt;50&#8197;&#956;M). In contrast, the conversion rate was lower at 29&#8201;% when the reference catalyst (NI&#8208;4) was used for photopolymerization under the same conditions, demonstrating the advantage of the TSCT photocatalyst. Finally, the TSCT material was used as a photocatalyst in practical lithography for the first time, achieving pattern resolutions of up to 10&#8197;&#956;m.

         <title>Synthetic Sialosides Terminated with 8&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted Sialic Acid as Selective Substrates for Sialidases from Bacteria and Influenza Viruses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing challenging C8&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;containing sialosides have been developed. High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies demonstrate that C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, bacteria, and influenza A and B viruses. The sialosides can be potentially used for diagnostic detection of sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.







Abstract
Sialosides containing C8&#8208;modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid&#8208;interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing para&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;tagged &#945;2&#8211;3&#8208; and &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;linked sialyl galactosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido, C8&#8208;azido, or C8&#8208;amino derivatized N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8&#8208;azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8&#8208;amino&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8&#8208;amino or C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease&#8208;causing sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing challenging C8-modified sialic acid-containing sialosides have been developed. High-throughput substrate specificity studies demonstrate that C8-modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, bacteria, and influenza A and B viruses. The sialosides can be potentially used for diagnostic detection of sialidase-producing pathogens.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sialosides containing C8-modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid-interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenol-tagged &#945;2&#8211;3- and &#945;2&#8211;6-linked sialyl galactosides containing C8-acetamido, C8-azido, or C8-amino derivatized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High-throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8-modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8-azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8-acetamido-modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8-amino-modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8-amino or C8-acetamido-modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease-causing sialidase-producing pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Twisting&#8208;Induced Helical Structures from Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Based Fibers Containing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>

We present a combination of wet spinning and twisting technique to continuously yield a novel circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) fibers, which can enable merging phosphorescence, handedness, robustness, flexibility, and knittability in a single system.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered significant attention owing to its distinctive optical characteristics and broad range of potential applications. However, the challenge remains in producing RTP materials with more simplicity, versatility, and practicality on a large scale, particularly in achieving chiral signals within a single system. Herein, we show that a straightforward and effective combination of wet spinning and twisting technique enables continuously fabricating RTP fibers with twisting&#8208;induced helical chirality. By leveraging the hydrogen bonding interactions between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and quinoline derivatives, along with the rigid microenvironment provided by PVA chains, typically, Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber demonstrates outstanding phosphorescent characteristics with RTP lifetime of 1.08&#8197;s and phosphorescence quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;%, and the improved tensile strength being 1.7 times than pure PVA fiber (172&#177;5.82 vs 100&#177;5.65&#8197;MPa). Impressively, the transformation from RTP to circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) is readily achieved by imparting left&#8208; or right&#8208;hand helical structure through simply twisting, enabling large&#8208;scale production of chiral Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber with dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;2. Besides, an array of displays and encryption patterns are crafted by weaving or seaming to exemplify the promising applications of these PVA&#8208;based fibers with outstanding adaptivity in cutting&#8208;edge anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Insights into E.&#8197;coli Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Synthase (CFAS) Towards Enantioselective Carbene Free Biocatalytic Cyclopropanation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as catalytic activity of the E. coli CFAS enzyme are disclosed. The selectivity of ecCFAS in the cyclopropanation of various phospholipids and the influence of vesicle formation on the catalytic activity have been reported. Mutagenesis and in silico experiments have been carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis. The biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate was accomplished with ecCFAS and catalytic SAM cofactor.







Abstract
Cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (CFAS) are a class of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase enzymes able to catalyse the cyclopropanation of unsaturated phospholipids. Since CFAS enzymes employ SAM as a methylene source to cyclopropanate alkene substrates, they have the potential to be mild and more sustainable biocatalysts for cyclopropanation transformations than current carbene&#8208;based approaches. This work describes the characterisation of E.&#8197;coli CFAS (ecCFAS) and its exploitation in the stereoselective biocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropyl lipids. ecCFAS was found to convert phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to methyl dihydrosterculate 1 with up to 58&#8201;% conversion and 73&#8201;% ee and the absolute configuration (9S,10R) was established. Substrate tolerance of ecCFAS was found to be correlated with the electronic properties of phospholipid headgroups and for the first time ecCFAS was found to catalyse cyclopropanation of both phospholipid chains to form dicyclopropanated products. In addition, mutagenesis and in silico experiments were carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis and to provide structural insights into the lipid substrate preference of ecCFAS. Finally, the biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate 1 and its deuterated analogue was also accomplished combining recombinant ecCFAS with the SAM regenerating AtHMT enzyme in the presence of CH3I and CD3I respectively.

         <title>Giant ab&#8208;Plane Birefringence in Quasi&#8208;1D Fibrous Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Kramers&#8208;Kronig analysis was employed to determine the complex refractive index of fibrous red phosphorus, revealing a notable birefringence of 0.642@475&#8197;nm. This remarkable performance can be ascribed to the large electronic dipole polarizability inherent in phosphorus, alongside the anisotropic distribution of electron density and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pairs (SCALP) induced by the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional structure.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals crystal fibrous red phosphorus (RP) exhibits pronounced in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy, positioning it as a potential candidate for polarization&#8208;related micro&#8208;nano devices. Unfortunately, a comprehensive investigation into the complex refractive index of fibrous RP and the structure&#8211;activity relationship connecting the distinctive quasi&#8208;1D structure with optical anisotropy is currently deficient. Herein, we have collectively determined the complex refractive index of the fibrous RP flakes within the ab&#8208;plane through Kramers&#8211;Kronig (KK) analysis and theoretical calculation. Notably, the maximum birefringence of fibrous RP reaches 0.642@475&#8197;nm with an absolute extinction coefficient of only 0.08, superior to the reported traditional optical crystals and the emerging low&#8208;dimensional materials as well. The remarkable birefringence can be attributed to the synergistic influence of the large electronic dipole polarizability, anisotropic electron density distribution and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP). This work demonstrates the potential of fibrous RP for polarization&#8208;sensitive devices, illuminating possibilities to exploit novel giant birefringent crystals based on the structure&#8211;activity relationship.

         <title>Converting Carbon Dioxide into Carbon Nanotubes by Reacting with Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to produce carbon nanotubes from CO2 and C2H6 at 750&#8201;&#176;C, utilizing earth&#8208;abundant transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) as catalysts. The process simultaneously generates syngas as byproducts. The morphology of the carbon nanotube depends on the type of catalysts.







Abstract
The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO2 emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO2 reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO2 and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth&#8208;abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750&#8201;&#176;C. This route facilitates long&#8208;term carbon storage via generating high&#8208;value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H2/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO2, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO2 not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30&#8201;% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO2 challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts produce CNT with a 20&#8197;nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe&#8208;based catalysts yield bamboo&#8208;like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO2 and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient method has been developed to produce carbon nanotubes from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; at 750&#8201;&#176;C, utilizing earth-abundant transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) as catalysts. The process simultaneously generates syngas as byproducts. The morphology of the carbon nanotube depends on the type of catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth-abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750&#8201;&#176;C. This route facilitates long-term carbon storage via generating high-value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30&#8201;% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co- and Ni-based catalysts produce CNT with a 20&#8197;nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe-based catalysts yield bamboo-like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Solid&#8208;State Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;like capabilities of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are exhibited through a thermal response. They arise from the unique rigidity of composite building units (CBUs). The resulting flexible ZIF mechanics resemble the slider&#8208;crank mechanism, they are regulated by chemical functionality and give rise to anisotropic mechanical properties.







Abstract
Machines have continually developed with the needs of daily life and industrial applications. While the careful design of molecular&#8208;scale devices often displays enhanced properties along with mechanical movements, controlling mechanics within solid&#8208;state molecular structures remains a significant challenge. Here, we explore the distinct mechanical properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)&#8212;frameworks that contain hidden mechanical components. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we uncover the machine&#8208;like capabilities of ZIFs, wherein connected composite building units operate similarly to a mechanical linkage system. Importantly, this research suggests that certain ZIF subunits act as core mechanical components, paving an innovative view for the future design of solid&#8208;state molecular machines.

         <title>Size and Polarizability of Boron Cluster Carriers Modulate Chaotropic Membrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic closo&#8208;borates have been systematically studied to identify the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos through lipid bilayers and living cells. By modifying the size of the cluster core and the halogen substituent, we found that the polarizability, a factor that determines their chaotropicity, may serve as a predictor of their transport activity and cytotoxicity for the rational design of permeable drugs







Abstract
Perhalogenated closo&#8208;borates represent a new class of membrane carriers. They owe this activity to their chaotropicity, which enables the transport of hydrophilic molecules across model membranes and into living cells. The transport efficiency of this new class of cluster carriers depends on a careful balance between their affinity to membranes and cargo, which varies with chaotropicity. However, the structure&#8211;activity parameters that define chaotropic transport remain to be elucidated. Here, we have studied the modulation of chaotropic transport by decoupling the halogen composition from the boron core size. The binding affinity between perhalogenated decaborate and dodecaborate clusters carriers was quantified with different hydrophilic model cargos, namely a neutral and a cationic peptide, phalloidin and (KLAKLAK)2. The transport efficiency, membrane&#8208;lytic properties, and cellular toxicity, as obtained from different vesicle and cell assays, increased with the size and polarizability of the clusters. These results validate the chaotropic effect as the driving force behind the membrane transport propensity of boron clusters. This work advances our understanding of the structural features of boron cluster carriers and establishes the first set of rational design principles for chaotropic membrane transporters.

         <title>Stabilizing Few&#8208;Atom Platinum Clusters by Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Glue for Efficient Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step strategy for the efficient and accurate synthesis of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters by predeposition of Zn1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue on MgO supports (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO). The Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO catalyst exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and a high activity with a TOF of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs.







Abstract
Few&#8208;atom metal clusters (FAMCs) exhibit superior performance in catalyzing complex molecular transformations due to their special spatial environments and electronic states, compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, achieving the efficient and accurate synthesis of FAMCs while avoiding the formation of other species, such as nanoparticles and SACs, still remains challenges. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy for synthesis of few&#8208;atom platinum (Pt) clusters by predeposition of zinc single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue (Zn1) on MgO nanosheets (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO), where FAMCs can be obtained over a wide range of Pt contents (0.09 to 1.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Zn atoms can act as Lewis acidic sites to allow electron transfer between Zn and Pt through bridging O atoms, which play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters. Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation. Moreover, an excellent activity with a turnover frequency of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs. Further theoretical studies revealed that the Pt atoms in Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO possess moderate steric hindrance, which enables high selectivity and activity for hydrosilylation. This work presents some guidelines for utilizing atomic&#8208;scale species to increase the synthesis efficiency and precision of FAMCs.

A cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modifications of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The twin&#8208;cage has four binding sites, which show site discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The copper(I) guest inside the tri&#8208;imine cage is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of bright emissive precursor clusters triggered by H2O2 solution.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;cluster&#8208;based twin&#8208;cage has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modification of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has double cavities and four binding sites, which show site&#8208;discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The guests in the tripodal hats affect the luminescence of the cluster: the tetra&#8208;silver(I) host&#8211;guest complex is weakly red&#8208;emissive, while the bis&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;bis&#8208;silver(I) one is non&#8208;emissive but is a stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecule. The copper(I) ion inside the tri&#8208;imine cavity is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of the bright emissive precursor cluster triggered by H2O2 solution. The hybridization of a cluster with cavities to construct a cluster&#8208;based cage presents an innovative concept for functional cluster design, and the post&#8208;clustering covalent modification opens up new avenues for finely tuning the properties of clusters.

         <title>Aggregation Enhanced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence through Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented a novel approach focused on modifying the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process by influencing dynamic processes in excited states through the aggregation effect. The results demonstrated that restricting molecular rotation and vibration is beneficial for enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST).







Abstract
Integrating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters holds great promise for the advancement of highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Despite recent advancements, a thorough comprehension of the underlying mechanisms remains imperative for the practical application of such materials. In this work, we introduce a novel approach aimed at modulating the TADF process by manipulating dynamic processes in excited states through aggregation effect. Our findings reveal that aggregation not only enhances both prompt and delayed fluorescence simultaneously but also imposes constraints on molecular reorientation. This constraint reinforces spin&#8208;orbit coupling and reduces the energy gap between singlets and triplets. These insights deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the aggregation effect on TADF materials and provide valuable guidance for the design of high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescent materials.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization: A Facile Strategy toward Functional Poly(Vinylpyridinium Salt)s with Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Killing Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization was successfully established, resulting in a series of poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weight and well&#8208;defined structure. The resulting polymers exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent luminescent properties, and most importantly, demonstrate excellent broad&#8208;spectrum bactericidal efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
Polymeric materials with antibacterial properties hold great promise for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. However, the synthesis of most antibacterial polymers typically involves complicated and time&#8208;consuming procedures. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy for synthesizing functional poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s via pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization. This click polymerization could proceed with high atom economy under mild conditions without any external catalyst, yielding soluble and thermally stable poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weights and well&#8208;defined structures in excellent yields. Additionally, the incorporation of luminescent units such as fluorene, tetraphenylethylene, and triphenylamine into the polymer backbone confers excellent aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties upon the resulting polymers, rendering them suitable for bacterial staining. Moreover, the existence of pyridinium salt imparts intrinsic antibacterial activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria to the polymers, enabling them to effectively inhibit wound bacterial infection and significantly expedite the healing process. This work not only provides an efficient method to prepare antibacterial polymers, but also opens up the possibility of various applications of polymers in healthcare and other antibacterial fields.

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanistic Role of Chiral Palladacycles in Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of carboxylic acids, the key palladacycles were isolated and characterized. Intermediate chemistry and stoichiometric transformation studies of the chiral palladacycles revealed that the C&#8722;H palladation step is irreversible and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining, and the functionalization step is ligand&#8208;independent.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions has attracted considerable attention due to its ability for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched molecules and stimulation of novel retrosynthetic disconnections. Understanding the reaction mechanism, especially the stereochemical process of the reaction, is crucial for the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems. Previously, we developed a Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalytic system for asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions. In this study, we focused on unraveling the chemistry of chiral palladacycles involved in the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. We have isolated key palladacycle intermediates involved in the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of carboxylic acids catalyzed by the Pd(II)/SOHP system. These palladacycles, exhibiting ligand&#8208;induced chirality, provided a significant opportunity to investigate the stereochemical process and the ligand effect in this asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization. Our investigation provided direct evidence for the C&#8722;H palladation step as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, which forms diastereomeric palladacycles that exhibited preservation of chirality in the functionalization step. DFT calculations provided insights into the chiral induction in palladacycle formation. This work highlights the value of chiral palladacycle chemistry in offering mechanistic insights into the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions.

         <title>Nonflammable Phosphate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Potassium Batteries Enabled by Optimized Solvation Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The safety and lifespan of energy storage devices have always been a challenge for the development of batteries, and potassium&#8208;ion batteries are no exception. In this work, we present an advanced non&#8208;flammable electrolyte achieved by carefully manipulating the solvation capability of a family of phosphate solvents. The customized electrolyte enables safe and stable cycling of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Current potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are limited in safety and lifetime owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. To address these issues, herein, we report an innovative non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design strategy that leverages an optimal moderate solvation phosphate&#8208;based solvent which strikes a balance between solvation capability and salt dissociation ability, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The formulated electrolyte simultaneously exhibits the advantages of low salt concentration (only 0.6&#8197;M), low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high oxidative stability, and safety. Our electrolyte also promotes the formation of self&#8208;limiting inorganic&#8208;rich interphases at the anode surface, alongside robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase on iron&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues, mitigating electrode/electrolyte side reactions and preventing Fe dissolution. Notably, the PIBs employing our electrolyte exhibit exceptional durability, with 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 2,000&#8197;cycles at high&#8208;voltage of 4.2&#8197;V in a coin cell. Impressively, in a larger scale pouch cell, it maintains over 81&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1,400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C&#8208;rate with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. This work represents a significant advancement toward the realization of safe, sustainable, and high&#8208;performance PIBs.

Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D c&#8208;MOFs, namely PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH&#8208;PA&#8208;TAPA and 8OH&#8208;PA&#8208;PyTTA). Notably, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these 2D c&#8208;MOFs can serve as promising cathode host materials for polyiodides in ADIBs for the first time. The incorporation of triphenylamine moieties in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF resulted in a higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance, retaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF. Our comparative analysis revealed that the increased number of N anchoring sites and larger pore size in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF facilitate efficient anchoring and conversion of I3&#8722;, as supported by spectroscopic electrochemistry and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Constructing Metal(II)&#8208;Sulfate Site Catalysts toward Low Overpotential Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Fuel Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN composite containing highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites, where CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with high selectivity (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%) via a carboxyl intermediate, was prepared. With the enlightenment of this new pathway, more metals might show their potential to convert CO2 under appropriate modulation.







Abstract
Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3&#8201;% at a cell voltage of 2.8&#8197;V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.

         <title>Robust, Efficient, and Recoverable Thermocells with Zwitterion&#8208;Boosted Hydrogel Electrolytes for Energy&#8208;Autonomous and Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy is employed to simultaneously enhance the mechanical properties and thermoelectrochemical performance of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs). This is realized by introducing a zwitterion&#8208;boosted hydrogel electrolyte. The as&#8208;fabricated TECs exhibit substantially improved overall performance, with the capability to repeatedly recover from severe mechanical damages through sol&#8208;gel transformations, demonstrating high potential in energy&#8208;autonomous wearable applications.







Abstract
The rapid growth of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs) provides a fresh way forward for wearable electronics. However, their insufficient mechanical strength and power output still hinder their further applications. This work demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy to synergistically enhance the mechanical and thermoelectrochemical properties of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722;&#8208;based TECs. By introducing Hofmeister effect and multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions via betaine zwitterions, the mechanical strength of the conventional brittle gelatin hydrogel electrolytes is substantially improved from 50 to 440&#8197;kPa, with a high stretchability approaching 250&#8201;%. Meanwhile, the betaine zwitterions strongly affect the solvation structure of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; ions, thus enlarging the entropy difference and raising the thermoelectrochemical Seebeck coefficient from 1.47 to 2.2&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1. The resultant quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state TECs exhibit a normalized output power density of 0.48&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, showing a notable improvement in overall performance compared to their counterparts without zwitterion regulation. The intrinsic thermo&#8208;reversible property also allows the TECs to repeatedly self&#8208;recover through sol&#8208;gel transformations, ensuring reliable energy output and even recycling of TECs in case of extreme mechanical damages. An energy&#8208;autonomous smart glove consisting of eighteen individual TECs is further designed, which can simultaneously monitor the temperature of different positions on any touched object, demonstrating high potential in wearable applications.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.







Abstract
Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization. This binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of rac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;propiothiolactones (rac&#8208;BTL and rac&#8208;PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with Mn up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (Tm=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (S)&#8208;BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (S)&#8208;2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.

Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-benzyl-3-mercapto-propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins.

         <title>Purely Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Molecule for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;Doped Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;doped OLEDs with conventional complex configurations containing thin emitting layers and simplified configurations featuring thick emitting layers as well as non&#8208;doped tandem and top&#8208;emitting OLEDs are achieved based on a tailor&#8208;made purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) molecule, providing the best electrophosphorescence efficiencies with ultrasmall efficiency roll&#8208;offs ever reported for RTP molecules.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are potential luminescent materials with high exciton utilization for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but those exhibiting superb electroluminescence (EL) performances are rarely explored, mainly due to their long phosphorescence lifetimes. Herein, a robust purely organic RTP molecule, 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenylindolo[3,2&#8208;a]carbazol&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;xanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT), is developed. The neat film of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT shows strong green RTP with a very short lifetime (2.9&#8197;&#956;s) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (72&#8201;%), and behaviors balanced bipolar charge transport. The RTP nature of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT is validated by steady&#8208;state and transient absorption and emission spectroscopies, and the working mechanism is deciphered by theoretical simulation. Non&#8208;doped multilayer OLEDs using thin neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT furnish an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.91&#8201;% with an extremely low roll&#8208;off (1.6&#8201;%) at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. High&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped top&#8208;emitting and tandem OLEDs are also achieved, providing remarkable EQEs of 24.53&#8201;% and 42.50&#8201;%, respectively. Delightfully, non&#8208;doped simplified OLEDs employing thick neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT are also realized, furnishing an excellent EQE of 17.79&#8201;% and greatly enhanced operational lifetime. The temperature&#8208;dependent and transient EL spectroscopies demonstrate the electrophosphorescence attribute of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT. These non&#8208;doped OLEDs are the best devices based on purely organic RTP materials reported so far.

         <title>Ultralow Catalytic Loading for Optimised Electrocatalytic Performance of AuPt Nanoparticles to Produce Hydrogen and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antenna&#8208;reactor nanoparticles (NPs) are at the forefront of plasmonic catalysis. This work demonstrates that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component in gold&#8208;platinum (AuPt) NPs unlock superior catalytic activity and controlled selectivity for hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions under visible&#8208;light excitation. This finding paves the way for designing highly efficient plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions are key to producing green hydrogen and ammonia. Antenna&#8211;reactor nanoparticles hold promise to improve the performances of these transformations under visible&#8208;light excitation, by combining plasmonic and catalytic materials. However, current materials involve compromising either on the catalytic activity or the plasmonic enhancement and also lack control of reaction selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component optimize catalytic activity and selectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Taking Pt&#8722;Au as an example we find that fine&#8208;tuning the Pt content produces a 6&#8208;fold increase in the hydrogen evolution compared to commercial Pt/C as well as a 6.5&#8208;fold increase in the nitrite reduction and a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in the selectivity for producing ammonia under visible light excitation relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory suggests that the catalytic reactions are accelerated by the intimate contact between nanoscale Pt&#8208;rich and Au&#8208;rich regions at the surface, which facilitates the formation of electron&#8208;rich hot&#8208;carrier puddles associated with the Pt&#8208;based active sites. The results provide exciting opportunities to design new materials with improved photocatalytic performance for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Programming Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoted Photoinduced Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, were produced and characterized. Further studies suggested that benefiting from boosted electron push&#8208;pull interactions, thereby facilitating charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Despite the pivotal role of molecular oxygen (O2) activation in artificial photosynthesis, the activation efficiency is often restricted by sluggish exciton dissociation and charge transfer kinetics within polymer photocatalysts. Herein, we propose two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, to promote O2 activation. Because of enhanced electron push&#8208;pull interactions that facilitated charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions over TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF under visible light irradiation, including the photosynthesis of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;thiocyano&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds and H2O2. These findings highlight the significant potential of the rational design of COFs with D&#8211;A configurations as suitable candidates for advanced photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Helically Chiral &#960;&#8208;Expanded Azocines Through Regioselective Beckmann Rearrangement and Their Charged States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allowed for convenient synthesis of negatively curved &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes with integrated azocine units. The helical compounds display high configurational stability and distinct homoenantiomeric &#960;&#8208; &#960; stacking in the solid state. Amphoteric two electron redox chemistry allows for characterization of the charged species with near&#8208;infrared absorption extending over 3000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report a synthetic approach to &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes incorporating tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5&#8208;membered ring, which exhibit intriguing structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8&#8208;membered lactam, azocine, and amine units. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, with distinct packing motifs in the solid state. The compounds exhibit promising optoelectronic properties with considerable photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission wavelengths depending on the relative position of the nitrogen center within the polycyclic framework. Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#8197;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.

Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near-infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#8197;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Zn/electrolyte Interphasial Chemistry by a Sustained&#8208;Release Drug Inspired Indium&#8208;Chelated Resin Protective Layer for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Zn//V2O5 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer is designed to stabilize the Zn/electrolyte interphasial region. The sustained release of In3+ can provide continuous heterogeneous nucleation sites for Zn deposition and alleviate HER side reactions, meanwhile the anchored resin matrix layer can repel detrimental anions like SO42&#8722; and V10O26(OH)24&#8722;, circumventing serious dendrite growth.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;metal batteries, the instable chemistry at Zn/electrolyte interphasial region results in severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, significantly impairing Zn anode reversibility. Moreover, an often&#8208;overlooked aspect is this instability can be further exacerbated by the interaction with dissolved cathode species in full batteries. Here, inspired by sustained&#8208;release drug technology, an indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer (Chelex&#8208;In), incorporating a sustained&#8208;release mechanism for indium, is developed on Zn surface, stabilizing the anode/electrolyte interphase to ensure reversible Zn plating/stripping performance throughout the entire lifespan of Zn//V2O5 batteries. The sustained&#8208;release indium onto Zn electrode promotes a persistent anticatalytic effect against HER and fosters uniform heterogeneous Zn nucleation. Meanwhile, on the electrolyte side, the residual resin matrix with immobilized iminodiacetates anions can also repel detrimental anions (SO42&#8722; and polyoxovanadate ions dissolved from V2O5 cathode) outside the electric double layer. This dual synergetic regulation on both electrode and electrolyte sides culminates a more stable interphasial environment, effectively enhancing Zn anode reversibility in practical high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity full battery systems. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired Chelex&#8208;In protective layer enables an ultralong lifespan of Zn anode over 2800&#8197;h, which is also successfully demonstrated in ultrahigh areal capacity Zn//V2O5 full batteries (4.79&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Achieving a Deeply Desodiated Stabilized Cathode Material by the High Entropy Strategy for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy strategy is applied to design a new P2 phase cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to improve stability in deeply desodiated states. This material exhibits superior reversibility with 0.61 Na extracted, attributed to triggered lattice&#8208;oxygen redox reaction activity and facilitated Na+ migration. As a result, it demonstrates excellent initial Coulombic efficiency, high energy density, and lengthened cycling performance.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based layered oxides are currently of significant interest as cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low toxicity and high specific capacity. However, the practical applications are impeded by sluggish intrinsic Na+ migration and poor structure stability as a result of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and complicated phase transition. In this study, a high&#8208;entropy strategy is proposed to enhance the high&#8208;voltage capacity and cycling stability. The designed P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.08Ni0.09Fe0.18Ti0.05O2 achieves a deeply desodiation and delivers charging capacity of 158.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to 0.61 Na with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.2&#8201;%. The charge compensation is attributed to the cationic and anionic redox reactions conjunctively. Moreover, the crystal structure is effectively stabilized, leading to a slight variation of lattice parameters. This research carries implications for the expedited development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>[2+1] Cycloadditions Modulate the Hydrophobicity of Ni&#8208;N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2+1] Cycloaddition of difluorocarbene onto N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Ni&#8208;N4 catalysts is successfully realized, leading to the covalent attachment of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups on the catalyst. The microenvironment of Ni&#8208;N4 sites is changed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic after installing &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups, which inhibits hydrogen evolution and thus favors CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Microenvironment regulation of M&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a promising way to tune their catalytic properties toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. However, strategies that can effectively introduce functional groups around the M&#8208;N4 sites through strong covalent bonding and under mild reaction conditions are highly desired. Taking the hydrophilic Ni&#8208;N4 SAC as a representative, we report herein a [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between Ni&#8208;N4 and in situ generated difluorocarbene (F2C:), and enable the surface fluorocarbonation of Ni&#8208;N4, resulting in the formation of a super&#8208;hydrophobic Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the mild reaction conditions allow Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 to inherit both the electronic and structural configuration of the Ni&#8208;N4 sites from Ni&#8208;N4. Enhanced electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Faradaic efficiency above 98&#8201;% is achieved in a wide operating potential window from &#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V over Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that a highly hydrophobic microenvironment formed by the &#8722;CF2&#8722; group repels asymmetric H&#8208;bonded water at the electrified interface, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction and promoting CO production. This work highlights the advantages of [2+1] cycloaddition reactions on the covalent modification of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts.

         <title>Stereoselective Entry into &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Oxepane Scaffolds through a Chalcogen Bonding Catalyzed Strain&#8208;Release C&#8208;Septanosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting chalcogen bonding catalysis, a rare thermodynamically favored strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation approach was developed to access the biologically relevant &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane scaffold. Besides tolerating a broad selection of substrates, this strategy taps upon an unknown steric guided intramolecular aglycone transposition pathway via a pentavalent silicon intermediate to achieve the excellent stereoselectivity outcome.







Abstract
The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively. Herein, we disclose the versatility of a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst to facilitate access into the challenging, but biologically interesting 7&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane core through an &#945;&#8208;selective strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation.

     alt="Stereoselective Entry into &#945;,&#945;&#8217;-C-Oxepane Scaffolds through a Chalcogen Bonding Catalyzed Strain-Release C-Septanosylation Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By exploiting chalcogen bonding catalysis, a rare thermodynamically favored strain-release &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation approach was developed to access the biologically relevant &#945;,&#945;&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted oxepane scaffold. Besides tolerating a broad selection of substrates, this strategy taps upon an unknown steric guided intramolecular aglycone transposition pathway via a pentavalent silicon intermediate to achieve the excellent stereoselectivity outcome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively. Herein, we disclose the versatility of a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst to facilitate access into the challenging, but biologically interesting 7-membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted oxepane core through an &#945;-selective strain-release &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation. Methodically, this strategy represents a switch from more common but entropically less desired macrocyclizations to a thermodynamically favored ring-expansion approach. In light of the general lack of stereoselective methods to access &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-septanosides, a remarkable palette of silyl-based nucleophiles can be reliably employed in our method. This include a broad variety of useful synthons, such as easily available silyl-allyl, silyl-enol ether, silyl-ketene acetal, vinylogous silyl-ketene acetal, silyl-alkyne and silylazide reagents.

         <title>Design of Solid Polycationic Electrolyte to Enable Durable Chloride&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion battery based on a low&#8208;cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.







Abstract
The high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) make them promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of CIBs is greatly restricted by the lack of compatible electrolytes to support cost&#8208;effective anodes. Herein, we present a rationally designed solid polycationic electrolyte (SPE) to enable room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion batteries utilizing aluminum (Al) metal as an anode. This SPE endows the CIB configuration with improved air stability and safety (i.e. free of flammability and liquid leakage). A high ionic conductivity (1.3&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been achieved by the well&#8208;tailored coordination structure of the SPE. Meanwhile, the solid polycationic electrolyte ensures stable electrodes|electrolyte interfaces, which effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on the Al anodes and degradation of the FeOCl cathodes. The Al|SPE|FeOCl chloride&#8208;ion batteries showcased a high discharge capacity around 250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (based on the cathodes) and extended lifespan. Our electrolyte design opens a new avenue for developing low&#8208;cost chloride&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regulating Spin Density using TEMPOL Molecules for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion by HKUST&#8208;1 Framework Derived Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin density of active Cu sites is regulated by incorporating nitroxide radicals (TEMPOL) in HKUST&#8208;1 frameworks. The formation of localized spin&#8208;ordered phase in the pristine spin&#8208;disordered phase allows for the asymmetric spin configuration on Cu&#8722;Cu sites in TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1. Therefore, its derived electrocatalyst shows a two&#8208;fold spin&#8208;enhanced ethylene selectivity in CO2 reduction compared to HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
The selectivity of multicarbon products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the spin alignment of neighboring active sites, which requires a spin catalyst that facilitates electron transfer with antiparallel spins for enhanced C&#8722;C coupling. Here, we design a radical&#8208;contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1) to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion, in which spin&#8208;disordered (SDO) and spin&#8208;ordered (SO) phases co&#8208;exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin&#8208;spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O&#8208;mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at &#8722;1.8&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST&#8208;1. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50&#8201;%. The exploration of the spin&#8208;polarized kinetics of the CO2RR provides a promising path for the development of novel spin electrocatalysts with superior performance.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Approach to the Enantioselective Construction of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Alcohols by Radical Epoxide Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate an operationally simple approach towards &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in good to excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios in two steps from diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our method relies on an unprecedented, radical, intramolecular syn&#8208;allyl transfer to intermediate &#946;&#8208;titanoxy radicals resulting from an Cp2TiIIIallyl&#8208;induced fragmentation of epoxide precursors.







Abstract
We describe a highly stereoconvergent radical epoxide allylation towards diastereomerically and enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in two steps from olefins. Our approach combines the stereospecifity and enantioselectivity of the Shi epoxidation with the unprecedented Ti(III)&#8208;promoted intramolecular radical group transfer allylation of epoxides. A directional isomerization step via configurationally labile radical intermediates enables the selective preparation of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in a unique fashion.

         <title>Carbon Free Radical (R&#8901;) Inactivates NF&#8208;&#954;B for Radical Capping Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical capping strategy is proposed by assembling carbon radical (R&#8901;) precursors loaded nanomicelles. R&#8901; is found to mediate electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in DNA, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction, resulting in a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and tumor metastasis inhibition. This mechanism is promising in macromolecules modification and radical mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract
Inactivating hyperactivated transcription factors can overcome tumor therapy resistance, but their undruggable features limit the development of conventional inhibitors. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;centered free radicals (R&#8901;) can inactivate NF&#8208;&#954;B transcription by capping the active sites in both NF&#8208;&#954;B and DNA. We construct a type of thermosensitive R&#8901; initiator loaded amphiphilic nano&#8208;micelles to facilitate intracellular delivery of R&#8901;. At a temperature of 43&#8201;&#176;C, the generated R&#8901; engage in electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in nucleotide bases, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction. As a result, both NF&#8208;&#954;B nuclear translocation and NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;DNA binding are suppressed, leading to a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibition of up to 94.1&#8201;%. We have further applied R&#8901; micelles in a clinical radiofrequency ablation tumor therapy model, showing remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and consequently tumor metastasis inhibition. Radical capping strategy not only provides a method to solve the heat&#8208;sink effect in clinic tumor hyperthermia, but also suggests a new perspective for controllable modification of biomacromolecules in cancer therapy.

At a temperature of 43&#8201;&#176;C, the generated R&#8901; engage in electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in nucleotide bases, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF-&#954;B through radical chain reaction. As a result, both NF-&#954;B nuclear translocation and NF-&#954;B-DNA binding are suppressed, leading to a remarkable NF-&#954;B inhibition of up to 94.1&#8201;%. We have further applied R&#8901; micelles in a clinical radiofrequency ablation tumor therapy model, showing remarkable NF-&#954;B inactivation and consequently tumor metastasis inhibition. Radical capping strategy not only provides a method to solve the heat-sink effect in clinic tumor hyperthermia, but also suggests a new perspective for controllable modification of biomacromolecules in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ Evolved Ligand Defects</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and confined H2O into pure syngas with controllable wide H2/CO ratios is presented. The ligand defect&#8208;induced in situ dynamic structure evolution of porous MOF catalyst favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics and the resultantly reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.

         <title>Intrarenal pH&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Diagnosis of Early Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly were developed for highly sensitive and long&#8208;term imaging of different stages of metabolic acidosis induced kidney injury.







Abstract
Metabolic acidosis&#8208;induced kidney injury (MAKI) is asymptomatic and lack of clinical biomarkers in early stage, but rapidly progresses to severe renal fibrosis and ultimately results in end&#8208;stage kidney failure. Therefore, developing rapid and noninvasive strategies direct responsive to renal tubular acidic microenvironment rather than delayed biomarkers are essential for timely renoprotective interventions. Herein, we develop pH&#8208;responsive luminescent gold nanoparticles (p&#8208;AuNPs) in the second near&#8208;infrared emission co&#8208;coated with 2,3&#8208;dimethylaleic anhydride conjugated &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethylamine and cationic 2&#8208;diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride, which showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly for highly sensitive and long&#8208;time (~24&#8197;h) imaging of different stages of MAKI. By integrating advantages of pH&#8208;induced intrarenal self&#8208;assembly and enhanced interactions between pH&#8208;triggered positively charged p&#8208;AuNPs and renal tubular cells, the early&#8208; and late&#8208;stage MAKI could be differentiated rapidly within 10&#8197;min post&#8208;injection (p.i.) with contrast index (CI) of 3.5 and 4.3, respectively. The corresponding maximum CI could reach 5.1 and 9.2 at 12&#8197;h p.i., respectively. Furthermore, p&#8208;AuNPs were demonstrated to effectively real&#8208;time monitor progressive recovery of kidney injury in MAKI mice after therapy, and also exhibit outstanding capabilities for drug screening. This pH&#8208;responsive strategy showed great promise for feedback on kidney dysfunction progression, opening new possibilities for early&#8208;stage diagnosis of pH&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Driven 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration via Radical Fluoromethylation of N&#8208;Allylbenzamides: a Straightforward Access to Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

An electrochemical difluoro&#8208; and trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides triggers the 1,4&#8208;migration of the aromatic ring through a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement. This transformation offers a straightforward access to valuable &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives in good yields and under mild reaction conditions from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
An electrochemical radical Truce Smiles rearrangement of N&#8208;allylbenzamides is documented herein. The selective 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was triggered by the radical fluoromethylation of the alkene providing a direct route to fluoro derivatives of the highly privileged &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine pharmacophore. This practical transformation utilizes readily available starting materials and employs an electrical current to drive the oxidative process under mild reaction conditions. It accommodates a variety of migratory aryl groups with different electronic properties and substitution patterns. Careful selection of the protecting group on the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;allylbenzamide is crucial to outcompete the undesired 6&#8208;endo cyclization and achieve high level of selectivity towards the 1,4&#8208;aryl migration. DFT calculations support the reaction mechanism and unveil the origin of selectivity between the two competitive pathways.

         <title>Multivariate Silicification&#8208;Assisted Single Enzyme Structure Augmentation for Improved Enzymatic Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221; is introduced, where inorganic silica precursors are used to balance the flexibility and stability of an enzyme. The integration of the enzyme with an organosilica framework brings advantages including surface microenvironment adjustability, structure augmentation, prolonged stability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility, which have the potential to expand enzyme applications.







Abstract
The ability to finely tune/balance the structure and rigidity of enzymes to realize both high enzymatic activity and long&#8208;term stability is highly desired but highly challenging. Herein, we propose the concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221;, where solid inorganic silica undergoes controlled hybridization with the fragile enzyme under moderate conditions at the single&#8208;enzyme level, thus enabling simultaneous structure augmentation, long&#8208;term stability, and high enzymatic activity preservation. A multivariate silicification approach was utilized and occurred around individual enzymes to allow conformal coating. To realize a high activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off the structure flexibility/rigidity of the silicazyme was optimized by a component adjustment ternary (CAT) plot method. Moreover, the multivariate organosilica frameworks bring great advantages, including surface microenvironment adjustability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility through the rich chemistry of silica. Overall silicazymes represent a new class of enzymes with promise for catalysis, separations, and nanomedicine.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanochannels with built&#8208;in electric fields were constructed by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets to manipulate ion transport, achieving a high rejection of salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases and simultaneously ultrafast water transport, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous charge nanochannel membranes.







Abstract
Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.

         <title>Molecularly Tunable Heterostructured Co&#8208;Polymers Containing Electron&#8208;Deficient and &#8208;Rich Moieties for Visible&#8208;Light and Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>

The construction of molecular heterostructures increases the molecular dipole moment and extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the interchain covalent bond (C=C) at its junction provides a channel for rapid electron transfer, leading to improved H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation without sacrificial agent.







Abstract
As an alternative to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by complex anthraquinone oxidation process, photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen without sacrificial agents is highly demanded. Herein, a covalently connected molecular heterostructure is synthesized via sequential C&#8722;H arylation and Knoevenagel polymerization reactions for visible&#8208;light and sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 synthesis. The subsequent copolymerization of the electron&#8208;deficient benzodithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione (BTD) and the electron&#8208;rich biphenyl (B) and p&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (CN) not only expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated domain but also increases the molecular dipole moment, which largely promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers. The optimal heterostructured BTDB&#8208;CN0.2 manifested an impressive photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 1920&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.2 and 11.6&#8197;times that of BTDB and BTDCN. As revealed by the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) and theoretical calculations, the linkage serves as a channel for the rapid transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. Further, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) uncovers that the oxygen reduction reaction occurs through the step one&#8208;electron pathway and the mutual conversion between C=O and C&#8722;OH with the anchoring of H+ during the catalysis favored the formation of H2O2. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of efficient organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Responsive Organic Fluorescent Aggregates Based on Ion&#8208;&#960; Interactions Away from Fluorescent Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules containing the same conjugated groups and different anions (Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;) exhibit completely different fluorescence behaviors under external stimuli. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders.







Abstract
Responsive organic luminescent aggregates have a wide range of application fields, but currently there is still a lack of reasonable molecular design strategies. Introducing ion&#8208;&#960; interactions into molecules can effectively alter their luminescent properties. However, current research typically focuses on ion localization at luminescent conjugated groups with the strong interaction forces. In this work, we introduce the flexible alkoxy chain spacers between fluorescent conjugated groups and ion&#8208;&#960; interaction sites, and then adjust the fluorescence performance of the molecule by changing the strength of ion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules with strong ion&#8208;&#960; interactions exhibit high and stable fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders under the external stimuli. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules with weak ion&#8208;&#960; interactions have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders, showing variable fluorescence intensities under external stimuli. This demonstrates a new class of responsive organic luminescent solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Revealing Hydrogen Bond Effect in Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinone&#8208;based small molecules with progressive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) numbers has been rationally designed to reveal the real effects of H&#8208;bond on the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials (OEMs) in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). The appropriate number of H&#8208;bonds in OEM improves its structure stability and utilization of active sites and reduces the battery polarization, contributing to the construction of high&#8208;performance ZOBs.







Abstract
The surrounding hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) interaction around the active sites plays indispensable functions in enabling the organic electrode materials (OEMs) to fulfill their roles as ion reservoirs in aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Despite important, there are still no works could fully shed its real effects light on. Herein, quinone&#8208;based small molecules with a H&#8208;bond evolution model has been rationally selected to disclose the regulation and equilibration of H&#8208;bond interaction between OEMs, and OEM and the electrolyte. It has been found that only a suitable H&#8208;bond interaction could make the OEMs fully liberate their potential performance. Accordingly, the 2,5&#8208;diaminocyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (DABQ) with elaborately designed H&#8208;bond structure exhibits a capacity of 193.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a record&#8208;high mass loading of 66.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the DABQ//Zn battery also possesses air&#8208;rechargeable ability by utilizing the chemistry redox of proton. Our results put forward a specific pathway to precise utilization of H&#8208;bond to liberate the performance of OEMs.

The study introduces alternating current (AC) electrolysis in ATRP using a symmetrical Cu/Cu electrode pair to generate the CuI activator complex and drive the polymerization. Square and sinusoidal waves at 0.1&#8197;Hz from an AC generator were used to polymerize many monomers (including functionals) in organic solvent, water, and bulk. The same electrode pair and the same AC current value were used for all polymerizations and block copolymerizations.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) and pulsed electrolysis are gaining traction in electro(organic) synthesis due to their advantageous characteristics. We employed AC electrolysis in electrochemically mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (eATRP) to facilitate the regeneration of the activator CuI complex on Cu0 electrodes. Additionally, Cu0 served as a slow supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA ATRP), enabling the activation of alkyl halides and the regeneration of the CuI activator through a comproportionation reaction. We harnessed the distinct properties of Cu0 dual regeneration, both chemical and electrochemical, by employing sinusoidal, triangular, and square&#8208;wave AC electrolysis alongside some of the most active ATRP catalysts available. Compared to linear waveform (DC electrolysis) or SARA ATRP (without electrolysis), pulsed and AC electrolysis facilitated slightly faster and more controlled polymerizations of acrylates. The same AC electrolysis conditions could successfully polymerize eleven different monomers across different mediums, from water to bulk. Moreover, it proved effective across a spectrum of catalyst activity, from low&#8208;activity Cu/2,2&#8208;bipyridine to highly active Cu complexes with substituted tripodal amine ligands. Chain extension experiments confirmed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of the produced polymers, yielding functional and high molecular&#8208;weight block copolymers. SEM analysis indicated the robustness of the Cu0 electrodes, sustaining at least 15 consecutive polymerizations.

         <title>Patterned Photonic Actuators with Dynamic Shape&#8208;Morphing and Color&#8208;Changing Capabilities Fabricated by Athermal Embossing Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An athermal embossing technique is introduced for the rapid fabrication of patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. Two demonstration models, one butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator and the other origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator, have been created to validate the synergistic shape&#8208;morphing and color&#8208;changing capabilities of patterned photonic actuators.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive patterned photonic actuators, characterized by their patterned nano/microscale structures and capacity to demonstrate synergistic color changes and shape morphing in response to external stimuli, have attracted intense scientific attention. However, traditional patterned photonic actuator systems still face limitations such as cumbersome and time&#8208;consuming preparation processes and small&#8208;scale deformations. Herein, we introduce a facile approach involving an athermal embossing technique to rapidly fabricate patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. The resulting patterned photonic actuators demonstrate remarkable features, including brilliant angle&#8208;dependent structural color, complex three&#8208;dimensional actuation, and good color durability under NIR light stimulation. As illustrative demonstrations of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate two light&#8208;fuelled patterned photonic soft actuators: a butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator that can produce wing&#8208;flapping dynamic changes in structural color, and an origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator with shape memory, structural color information storage, and dynamic display properties. This strategy provides distinct insights into the design and fabrication of various patterned photonic soft robotic devices and intelligent actuators.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.







Abstract
Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non&#8208;communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system. Herein we report that communication between two different dynamic libraries through an irreversible process is also possible. Indeed, alkyl amines cancel the dynamic regime on the nucleophilic substitution of tetrazines, generating kinetically inert compounds. Interestingly, such amine can be part of another dynamic library, an imine&#8208;amine exchange. Thus, both libraries are interconnected with each other by an irreversible process which leads to kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Additionally, a latent irreversible intercommunication could be developed. In such a way, a stable molecular system with specific host&#8211;guest and fluorescence properties, could be irreversibly transformed when the right stimulus was applied, triggering the cancellation of the original supramolecular and luminescent properties and the emergence of new ones.

         <title>Highly Stable MOF&#8208;Type Lead Halide Luminescent Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis of a series of MOF&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics with exceptional robustness. The strategy emphasizes the importance of high structural integrity in designing the high&#8208;Curie temperature ferroelectrics and the covalent interactions to facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer to achieve long&#8208;lived phosphorescence.







Abstract
Lead halide molecular ferroelectrics represent an important class of luminescent ferroelectrics, distinguished by their high chemical and structural tunability, excellent processability and distinctive luminescent characteristics. However, their inherent instability, prone to decomposition upon exposure to moisture and light, hinders their broader ferroelectric applications. Herein, for the first time, we present a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics, demonstrating exceptional robustness under ambient conditions for at least 15&#8197;months and even when subjected to aqueous boiling conditions. Unlike conventional metal&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) in MOFs adopting highly centrosymmetric structure with limited structural distortion, our lead halide&#8208;based MOFs occupy structurally deformable [Pb2X]+ (X=Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;/I&#8722;) SBUs that facilitate a c&#8208;axis&#8208;biased displacement of Pb2+ centers and substantially contribute to thermoinducible structural transformation. Importantly, this class of MOF&#8208;type lead halide ferroelectrics undergo ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transitions with remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 505&#8197;K, superior to most of molecular ferroelectrics. Moreover, the covalent bonding between phosphorescent organic component and the light&#8208;harvesting inorganic component achieves efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing, resulting in long&#8208;lived afterglow emission. The compelling combination of high stability, ferroelectricity and afterglow emission exhibited by lead halide MOFs opens up many potential opportunities in energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Unlocking the NIR&#8208;II AIEgen for High Brightness through Intramolecular Electrostatic Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkylthio side chain on the thiophene bridge affords sulfur&#8212;nitrogen electrostatic lock, substantially improving the fluorescent brightness of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained NIR&#8208;II AIEgen shows high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging and high sensitivity in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for non&#8208;invasive, radiation&#8208;free, and rapid&#8208;response clinical diagnosis. However, it's still challenging to develop bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6&#8208;fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The in vivo experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio 1.9&#8208;fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near-infrared-II (NIR-II) window holds great promise for non-invasive, radiation-free, and rapid-response clinical diagnosis. However, it's still challenging to develop bright NIR-II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR-II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6-fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal-to-background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal-to-noise ratio 1.9-fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low-concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR-II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfones via Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclic sulfolene has been developed. A range of structrally diverse and enantioenriched C2 or C3 substituted cyclic sulfones are conveniently synthesized by this method. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Cyclic sulfones have demonstrated important applications in drug discovery. However, the catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyclic sulfones remains challenging. Herein, we develop nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of sulfolenes to streamline the synthesis of chiral alkyl cyclic sulfones. The method has broad scope and high functional group tolerance. The regioselectivity can be controlled by ligands only. A neutral PYROX ligand favors C3&#8208;alkylation whereas an anionic BOX ligand favors C2&#8208;alkylation. This control is kinetic in origin as the C2&#8208;bound Ni intermediates are always thermodynamically more stable. Reactivity study of a wide range of relevant Ni intermediates reveal a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle with a NiII&#8722;H species as the resting state. The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining step is the insertion of this NiII&#8722;H species into 2&#8208;sulfolene. This work provides an efficient catalytic method for the synthesis of an important class of organic compounds and enhances the mechanistic understanding of Ni&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective hydroalkylation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A longitudinally helical molecular carbon featuring six benzene rings benzannulated to zigzag edges of a heptacene core, was synthesized by Lei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202407547). The steric congestion introduced by the benzannulation pattern causes the molecular carbon to adopt a helical heptacene core with local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The molecular carbon with two&#8208;dimensional crystal packing exhibits excellent charge transport properties.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch at the Heterojunction of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch is crucial for the efficiency and lifetime of perovskite solar cells because it affects interfacial charge behavior and perovskite degradation. This review discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, carrier dynamics, and detailed characterizations. It also exposes challenges to mitigate mismatch as well as a solution and outlook to promote renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;technology advancements.







Abstract
Lattice mismatch significantly influences microscopic transport in semiconducting devices, affecting interfacial charge behavior and device efficacy. This atomic&#8208;level disordering, often overlooked in previous research, is crucial for device efficiency and lifetime. Recent studies have highlighted emerging challenges related to lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells, especially at heterojunctions, revealing issues like severe tensile stress, increased ion migration, and reduced carrier mobility. This review systematically discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, and carrier dynamics. It also includes detailed characterizations of these phenomena and summarizes current strategies including epitaxial growth and buffer layer, as well as explores future solutions to mitigate mismatch&#8208;induced issues. We also provide the challenges and prospects for lattice mismatch, aiming to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, and contribute to renewable energy technology advancements.

         <title>Redox Approaches to Carbene Generation in Catalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the cyclopropanation of alkenes using carbenes generated reductively from gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes/carbonyl compounds or oxidatively from methylene groups.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions have a century&#8208;old history in organic chemistry and are a primary method for the synthesis of cyclopropanes. Much of the work in this field has focused on the use of diazo compounds and related precursors, which can transfer a carbene fragment to a catalyst with concomitant loss of a stable byproduct. Despite the utility of this approach, there are persistent limitations in the scope of viable carbenes, most notably those lacking stabilizing substituents. By coupling carbene transfer chemistry with two&#8208;electron redox cycles, it is possible to expand the available starting materials that can be used as carbene precursors. In this Minireview, we discuss emerging catalytic reductive cyclopropanation reactions using either gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes or carbonyl compounds. This strategy is inspired by classic stoichiometric transformations, such as the Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and the Clemmensen reduction, but instead entails the formation of a catalytically generated transition metal carbene or carbenoid. We also present recent efforts to generate carbenes directly from methylene (CR2H2) groups via a formal 1,1&#8208;dehydrogenation. These reactions are currently restricted to substrates containing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which serve to facilitate deprotonation and subsequent oxidation of the anion.

         <title>BINOL&#8208;Based Chiral Macrocycles and Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of BINOL derivatives into the supramolecular architectures of chiral macrocycles and cages offers distinct advantages in applications such as circularly polarized luminescence, enantiomer separation, biological transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chirality, a fundamental principle in chemistry, biology, and medicine, is prevalent in nature and in organisms. Chiral molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are crucial in biomolecular synthesis, as well as in the development of functional materials. Among these, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL) stands out for its stable chiral configuration, versatile functionality, and commercial availability. BINOL is widely employed in asymmetric catalysis and chiral materials. This review mainly focuses on recent research over the past five years concerning the use of BINOL derivatives for constructing chiral macrocycles and cages. Their contributions to chiral luminescence, enantiomeric separation, transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis were examined.

         <dc:description>
The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in ECL microscopy, emphasizing original configurations which enable the mapping of the (electro)chemical reactivity and the imaging of biological entities. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging single ECL photons or molecules.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near&#8208;zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasizing original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays. Additionally, mapping the (electro)chemical reactivity in space provides valuable information on nanomaterials and facilitates deciphering ECL mechanisms for improving their performances in diagnostics and (electro)catalysis. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging at the ultimate limits of single molecules, single photons or single chemical reactions, and the current challenges to translate the ECL imaging advances to other fields such as material science, catalysis and biology.

Chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed 1,12&#8208;addition of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates to alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols furnished a wide range of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in high yields with good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of quinone methides formed in situ has been flourishing in recent years. In sharp contrast, the development and utilization of biphenyl quinone methides are rare. In this study, we achieved a remote stereocontrolled 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition of biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ for the first time. In the presence of a suitable chiral phosphoric acid, alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides were generated from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols, followed by enantioselective 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition with indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates. The strategy enabled the alcohols to serve as efficient allenylation reagents, providing practical access to a broad range of axially chiral allenes bearing a (1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;ol unit, which were previously less accessible. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism, indicating that enantioselectivity originates from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, not only the presence of biphenyl quinone methides as versatile intermediates was confirmed but also organocatalytic enantioselective 1,12&#8208;addition was established.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Formal C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylations via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling with Versatile Arylsulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation via the dibenzothiophenylation/nickel&#8208;catalyzed eXEC sequence is presented. The first activation step selectively gives aryldibenzothiophenium salts, which are subsequently engaged in electroreductive nickel catalysis. The method provides various C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) linkages with high sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon contents. The demonstration of one&#8208;pot alkylations further reinforces the practicality of our approach.







Abstract
Producing sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon&#8208;enriched molecules is of particular interest due to their high success rate in clinical trials. The installation of aliphatic chains onto aromatic scaffolds was accomplished by nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with arylsulfonium salts. Thus, simple non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes could be alkylated through the formation of aryldibenzothiophenium salts. The reaction employs an electrochemical approach to avoid potentially hazardous chemical redox agents, and importantly, the one&#8208;pot alkylation proved also viable, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligand Enables Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Propargyl C&#8722;H Functionalization via Reactive Gold Allenylidene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive gold allenylidenes are catalytically generated via ligand&#8208;enabled redox decomposition of alkynylbenziodoxole substrates. In cooperation with gold, a remote amide group in the biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligand is remarkably capable of deprotonating at the propargylic position. DFT calculations offer support to the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Gold allenylidene species have been seldom exploited as reactive intermediates in synthetically versatile catalytic reactions. By employing alkynylbenziodoxoles as the substrates and bifunctional WangPhos as the metal ligand, this work demonstrated ready catalytic access to these intermediates of general substitution patterns and their electrophilic reactivities at the &#947;&#8208;carbon center with a diverse range of nucleophiles. The reaction is driven by the reductive decomposition of the benziodoxole moiety and achieves the replacement of a propargylic proton with an N/O/C&#8208;based nucleophile, hence realizing reactivity umpolung. Corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the reaction mechanism involves a mild propargylic deprotonation. In contrast to prior works employing a tertiary amine functionality, a weakly Br&#216;nsted&#8208;basic amide group in WangPhos is surprisingly effective in deprotonation at the propargylic position under a gold&#8208;ligand cooperation regime.

         <title>A BRD4&#8208;Targeting Photothermal Agent for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent was developed for controlled protein degradation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the photothermal agent could efficiently induce BRD4 protein degradation, inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function and ultimately achieving low&#8208;temperature PTT of cancer cells.







Abstract
BRD4 protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Disrupting the activity of BRD4 has emerged as a promising strategy for inhibiting the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Herein, we introduced a BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent for controlled protein degradation, aiming to enhance low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment. By incorporating a BRD4 protein inhibitor into a cyanine dye scaffold, the photothermal agent specifically bond to the bromodomain of BRD4. Upon low power density laser irradiation, the agent induced protein degradation, directly destroying the BRD4 structure and inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function. This strategy not only prolonged the retention time of the photothermal agent in cancer cells but also confined the targeted protein degradation process solely to the tumor tissue, minimizing side effects on normal tissues through the aid of exogenous signals. This work established a simple and feasible platform for future PTT agent design in clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>Advancing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Isoreticular Cluster Concept</title>

         <dc:description>
A new dimension to isoreticular chemistry is enabled by using isoreticular cluster concept to develop a series of hierarchical clusters whose co&#8208;assembly can follow different pathways dictated by a delicate balance between various competing chemical interactions.







Abstract
Trigonal planar M3(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high&#8208;impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M3(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double&#8208;deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned MOFs called M3M6 pacs made from co&#8208;assembly between M3 single&#8208;deck trimer and M3x2 double&#8208;deck trimer. Important factors were identified on this multi&#8208;modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M3M6 pacs by overcoming the formation of previously&#8208;always&#8208;observed same&#8208;cluster phases. The new pacs materials exhibit high surface area and high uptake capacity for CO2 and small hydrocarbons, as well as selective adsorption properties relevant to separation of industrially important mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4. Furthermore, new M3M6 pacs materials show electrocatalytic properties with high activity.

         <title>Development of Stable Water&#8208;Soluble Supratomic Silver Clusters Utilizing A Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Protected Strategy: Giant Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type Ag8@Nb162 Fluorescent Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyoxoniobate&#8208;protected approach has been introduced for the first time, aiming to synthesize stable and water&#8208;soluble silver nanoclusters. Employing this method, we have successfully synthesized a giant Ag8@Nb162 core&#8211;shell nanocluster exhibiting reversible temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence responses. Leveraging these fluorescence features, we have demonstrated a sophisticated multiple optical encryption mode with potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit technology.







Abstract
Atomically precise low&#8208;nuclearity (n&lt;10) silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have garnered significant interest due to their size&#8208;dependent optical properties and diverse applications. However, their synthesis has remained challenging, primarily due to their inherent instability. The present study introduces a new feasible approach for clustering silver ions utilizing highly negative and redox&#8208;inert polyoxoniobates (PONbs) as all&#8208;inorganic ligands. This strategy not only enables the creation of novel Ag&#8208;PONb composite nanoclusters but also facilitates the synthesis of stable low&#8208;nuclearity AgNCs. Using this method, we have successfully synthesized a small octanuclear rhombic [Ag8]6+ AgNC stabilized by six highly negative [LiNb27O75]14&#8722; polyoxoanions. This marks the first PONb&#8208;protected superatomic AgNC, designated as {Ag8@(LiNb27O75)6} (Ag8@Nb162), with an aesthetically spherical core&#8211;shell structure. The crystalline Ag8@Nb162 is stable under ambient conditions, What's more, it is water&#8208;soluble and able to maintain its molecular cluster structure intact in water. Further, the stable small [Ag8]6+ AgNC has interesting temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent reversible fluorescence response, based on which a multiple optical encryption mode for anti&#8208;counterfeit technology was demonstrated. This work offers a promising avenue for the synthesis of fascinating and stable PONb&#8208;protected AgNCs and sheds light on the development of new&#8208;type optical functional materials.

         <title>Adaptive Response to Solvation in Flexible Molecules: Oligo Hydrates of 4&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise Hydration of a flexible organic molecule reveals how water solvation scaffolds deforms the substrate structure, generally through different structural pathways. In this experiment we observed solvation with up to five water molecules for 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, using broadband microwave spectroscopy. Solvation is accompanied by multiple isomerization, as two isomers were rotationally detected for each cluster.







Abstract
Structural changes induced by water play a pivotal role in chemistry and biology but remain challenging to predict, measure, and control at molecular level. Here we explore size&#8208;governed gas&#8208;phase water aggregation in the flexible molecule 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, modeling the conformational adaptability of flexible substrates to host water scaffolds and the preference for sequential droplet growth. The experiment was conducted using broadband rotational spectroscopy, rationalized with quantum chemical calculations. Two different isomers were observed experimentally from the di&#8208; to the pentahydrates (4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone&#8208;(H2O)n=2&#8211;5), including the 18O isotopologues for the di&#8208; and trihydrates. Interestingly, to accommodate water molecules effectively, the heavy atom skeleton of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone reshapes in every observed isomer and does not correspond to the stable conformer of the free monomer. All solvates initiate from the alcohol group (proton donor) but retain the carbonyl group as secondary binding point. The water scaffolds closely resemble those found in the pure water clusters, balancing between the capability of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone for steering the orientation and position of the water molecules and the ability of water to modulate the monomer's conformation. The present work thus provides an accurate molecular description on how torsionally flexible molecules dynamically adapt to water along progressing solvation.

         <title>Type&#8197;I Photoinitiator Based on Sustainable Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as Type&#8197;I photoinitiators (PI) for traditional free radical photopolymerization. The polymer networks obtained exhibit less inhomogeneity compared to traditional phosphine oxide photoinitiators. The remarkably lower migration rate of the CD based PIs gives hope to solve toxicological issues arising with some traditional PIs.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as photoinitiators for traditional free radical photopolymerization. Carbon dots were made following a solvothermal procedure from sustainable furfural available from lignocellulose. Surficial aldehyde moieties reacted with hydroxylamine to the respective oxime while reaction with benzoyl chloride resulted in a biobased Type&#8197;I photoinitiator comprising sustainable carbon dot (CD&#8208;PI). Photoinitiating ability was compared with the traditional photoinitiator (PI) ethyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphinate (TPO&#8208;L) by real&#8208;time FTIR with UV exposure at 365&#8197;nm. Photopolymer composition based on a mixture of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) resulted in a similar final conversion of about 70&#8201;% using either CD&#8208;PI or TPO&#8208;L. Nevertheless, it appeared homogeneous in the case of compositions processed with CD&#8208;PI, while those made with TPO&#8208;L were heterogeneous as shown by two glass transition temperatures. Moreover, the migration rate of CD&#8208;PI in the cured samples was lower in comparison with those samples using TPO&#8208;L as PI.

         <title>A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (TTM&#8208;I). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky&#8208;blue color and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In&#8208;depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H (N&#8208;Phenyltetrazole)thiolation as an Enabling Tool for Molecular Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C&#8722;H bonds allows access to N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers which are elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The reaction proceeds via radical&#8208;chain hydrogen atom transfer by the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical with substrate as limiting reagent in all cases.







Abstract
Methods enabling the broad diversification of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds from a common intermediate are especially valuable in chemical synthesis. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using a commercially available disulfide to access N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers. The thioether products are readily elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The C&#8722;H functionalization proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving hydrogen atom transfer by the electron&#8208;poor N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical. Hexafluoroisopropanol was found to be essential to reactions involving aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H thiolation, with computational analysis consistent with dual hydrogen bonding of the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical imparting increased radical electrophilicity to facilitate the hydrogen atom transfer. Substrate is limiting reagent in all cases, and the reaction displays an exceptional functional group tolerance well suited to applications in late&#8208;stage diversification.

         <title>Highly Condensed and Super&#8208;Incompressible Be2PN3</title>

Be&#8208;containing nitrides are sparsely investigated. The herein presented Be2PN3 expands the synthetic approach to highly condensed beryllium nitrides under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions.

Abstract
Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high&#8208;pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite&#8208;type Be2PN3, which was synthesized from Be3N2 and P3N5 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type M2PN3 (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be2PN3 is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by 9Be and 31P solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present 9Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low&#8208;density material. The formation of Be2PN3 through a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be&#8208;containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.

Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been achieved through a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives. Moreover, rapid access of S&#8208;BCOs, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Zn(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed uncommon [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of BCBs.







Abstract
The exploration of the complex chemical diversity of bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes and their use as benzene bioisosteres has garnered significant attention over the past two decades. Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) using a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives have been established. The first hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition of BCBs, catalyzed by Zn(OTf)2, was achieved with a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. In contrast, the less electrophilic BCB ester undergoes a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] reaction with 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes, yielding BCHs with a spirocyclic quaternary carbon center. Control experiments and preliminary theoretical calculations suggest that the diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] product formation may involve a concerted cycloaddition between a zwitterionic intermediate and E&#8208;1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition may involve a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism.

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Heavy Pnictogen Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript describes the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted addition of pnictogen&#8208;pnictogen double bonds to a late transition metal. The use of light has been essential to unlock the reactivity of this otherwise unreactive class of compounds.







Abstract
The chemistry of light dipnictenes has been widely investigated in the last century with remarkable achievements especially for azobenzene derivatives. In contrast, distibenes and dibismuthenes are relatively rare and show very limited reactivity. Herein, we have designed a protocol using visible light to enhance the reactivity of heavy dipnictenes. Exploiting the distinctive &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, we have been able to isolate unique examples of dipnictene&#8208;cobalt complexes. The reactivity of the distibene complex was further exploited using red light in the presence of a diazoolefin to access an unusual four&#8208;membered bicyclo[1.1.0]butane analog, containing only a single carbon atom. These findings set the bases to a conceptually new strategy in heavy element double bonds chemistry where visible light is at the front seat of bond activation.

         <title>Planar Tetranuclear Uranium Hydride Cluster Supported by ansa&#8208;Bis(cyclopentadienyl) Ligands</title>

The first example of a U4H8 cluster was stabilized by ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligands, representing the largest uranium hydride cluster reported to date. The four uranium centers are arranged in planar rhombic geometry, which differs from the polyhedral geometry observed in previously reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters.







Abstract
Polynuclear metal hydride clusters play important roles in various catalytic processes, with most of the reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters adopting a polyhedral three&#8208;dimensional structure. Herein, we report the first example of a planar tetranuclear uranium hydride cluster [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]4(&#956;2&#8208;H)4(&#956;3&#8208;H)4 (U4H8). It was synthesized by reacting an ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand&#8208;supported uranium chloride precursor [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2 with NaHBEt3. The presence of hydrides in U4H8 was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and its reactivity with phenol and carbon tetrachloride. DFT calculations also facilitated the determination of the hydrides&#8217; positions in U4H8, featuring four bridging &#956;2&#8208;H ligands and four face&#8208;capping &#956;3&#8208;H ligands, with the four U centers arranged in a rhombic geometry. The U4H8 represents not only the first example of planar polynuclear actinide metal hydride cluster but also the uranium hydride cluster with the highest nuclearity reported to date.

         <title>Fluorophilic Sigma(&#963;)&#8208;Lock Self&#8208;Healable Copolymers</title>

Autonomous damage&#8208;repair in commodity poly(pentafluorostyrene/n&#8208;butyl acrylate) [p(PFS/n&#8208;BA)} copolymers via lateral dipolar forces between C&#8722;F aromatic and CH3CH2&#8722; aliphatic ends through &#963;&#8208;&#963; orbitals forming fluorophilic sigma(&#963;)&#8208;lock.







Abstract
Although F&#8208;Containing molecules and macromolecules are often used in molecular biology to increase the binding with Lewis acidic groups by introducing favorable C&#8722;F dipoles, there is virtually no experimental evidence and limited understanding of the nature of these interactions, especially their role in synthetic polymeric materials. These studies elucidate the molecular origin of inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;Chain interactions responsible for self&#8208;healing of F&#8208;Containing copolymers composed of pentafluorostyrene and n&#8208;butyl acrylate units (p(PFS/nBA). Guided by dynamic surface oscillating force (SOF) and spectroscopic measurements supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these studies show that the reformation of &#963;&#8208;&#963; orbitals in &#8722;C&#8722;F of PFS and CH3CH2&#8722; of nBA units enables the recovery of entropic energy via fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals forces when PFS/nBA molar ratios are ~50/50. The strength of these interactions determined experimentally for self&#8208;healable PFS/nBA compositions is in the order ~0.3&#8197;kcal/mol which primarily comes from fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock (~70&#8201;%) contributions. These interactions are significantly diminished for non&#8208;self&#8208;healable counterparts. Strongly polarized &#8722;C&#8722;F &#963; orbitals create lateral dipolar forces enhancing the affinity towards &#8722;C&#8722;H orbitals, facilitating energetically favorable interactions. Entropic recovery driven by non&#8208;Covalent bonding offers a valuable tool in designing materials with unique functionalities, particularly self&#8208;healable batteries and energy storage devices.

         <title>Hexabenzoheptacene: A Longitudinally Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Local Aromaticity and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of longitudinally twisted molecular nanocarbons, composed of six benzene rings periodically benzannulated to both zigzag edges of a heptacene core, has been synthesized and characterized. The new molecular nanocarbons adopt helical conformations with local aromaticity and enhanced stability while maintaining the electronic properties and packing motif necessary to serve as functional materials for organic electronic devices.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a longitudinally helical molecular nanocarbon, hexabenzoheptacene (HBH), along with its dimethylated derivative (HBH&#8208;Me), which are composed of six benzene rings periodically benzannulated to both zigzag edges of a heptacene core. This benzannulation pattern endows the resulting nanocarbons with a helical heptacene core and local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The chiral HBH&#8208;Me adopts a more highly twisted conformation with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 95&#176;, enabling the separation of the enantiomers. Both HBH and HBH&#8208;Me can be facilely oxidized into their corresponding dications, which exhibit enhanced planarity and aromaticity upon loss of electrons. Notably, both longitudinally helical nanocarbons readily promote solid state packing into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arrangement. Single&#8208;crystal microbelts of HBH&#8208;Me show hole mobility up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, illustrating the promising potential of these longitudinally helical molecules for organic electronic devices.

         <dc:description>
The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of acremolactone&#8197;B, a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide, has been achieved by using an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization strategy.







Abstract
Acremolactone&#8197;B is a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide. The first total synthesis of this molecule was achieved on a gram scale, based on an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization strategy for construction of the tetra&#8208;substituted pyridine ring. A bicyclic intermediate was expeditiously prepared by using [2+2] photocycloaddition and chemoselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation, which was further elaborated to a densely substituted aza&#8208;triene. An electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade was utilized to forge the tetracyclic core of this natural product, and the side chain was introduced through diastereoselective acylation and reduction.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8211;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8211;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8211;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8211;S bond from 2.24 &#197; to 2.30 &#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8211;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8211;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8210;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8211;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates&#160;that Cu&#8211;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx HTM, the&#160;TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7% for TP&#8208;MN (1).&#160;Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups, and NiOx HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#160;h.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics with Exceptional Conductivity by Polymer&#8208;Dopant Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high electrical conductivity (&#963;) and power factor (PF) simultaneously remains a significant challenge for n&#8208;type organic themoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OTEs performance through blending a fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and its selenophene&#8208;substituted analogue f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN with a julolidine&#8208;functionalized benzimidazoline n&#8208;dopant JLBI, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis when blended with commercially available n&#8208;dopants TAM and N&#8208;DMBI. The advantages of introducing a more lipophilic julolidine group into the dopant structure of JLBI are evidenced by the enhanced OTEs performance that JLBI&#8208;doped films show when compared to those doped with N&#8208;DMBI or TAM. In fact, thanks to the enhanced intermolecular interactions and the lower&#8208;lying LUMO level enabled by the increase of selenophene content in polymer backbone, JLBI&#8208;doped films of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN exhibit a unprecedent &#963; of 206 S cm&#8722;1 and a PF of 114 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. Interestingly, &#963; can be further enhanced up to 326 S cm&#8722;1 by using TAM dopant as a consequence of its favorable diffusion behavior into densely packed crystalline domains. These values are the highest to date for solution&#8208;processed molecularly n&#8208;doped polymers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the polymer&#8208;dopant matching approach carried out in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>From Plastic Waste to Green Hydrogen and Valuable Chemicals Using Sunlight and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental procedure generally involves two distinct processes: (1) pre&#8208;treatment of original plastics; and (2) photoreforming of these treated molecules. The initial stage is essential for the breakdown of long carbon chains into smaller components via pulverization and monomerization, while the subsequent stage focuses on transforming these components into economically valuable products through photoreforming. Plastic photoreforming employs a photocatalyst, typically a semiconductor, that absorbs sunlight and initiating chemical reactions. This approach has the capacity to convert plastic waste into high&#8208;value chemicals and generate hydrogen (H2) through water splitting under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Over 79&#8201;% of 6.3 billion tonnes of plastics produced from 1950 to 2015 have been disposed in landfills or found their way to the oceans, where they will reside for up to hundreds of years before being decomposed bringing upon significant dangers to our health and ecosystems. Plastic photoreforming offers an appealing alternative by using solar energy and water to transform plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemical commodities, while simultaneously producing green hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review aims to provide an overview of the underlying principles of emerging plastic photoreforming technologies, highlight the challenges associated with experimental protocols and performance assessments, discuss recent global breakthroughs on the photoreforming of plastics, and propose perspectives for future research. A critical assessment of current plastic photoreforming studies shows a lack of standardised conditions, hindering comparison amongst photocatalyst performance. Guidelines to establish a more accurate evaluation of materials and systems are proposed, with the aim to facilitate the translation of promising fundamental discovery in photocatalysts design.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Hydrogenation in Concentrated Seawater at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cation of concentrated seawater was demonstrated to promote C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4. Benefiting from this, FE of C2H4 is higher than 97&#8201;% at 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in concentrated seawater. An integrated system was designed for C2H4 and H2 production from C2H2 and seawater.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene (E&#8208;AHE) is a promising alternative for thermal&#8208;catalytic process, yet it suffers from low current densities and efficiency. Here, we achieved a 71.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of E&#8208;AHE at a large partial current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using concentrated seawater as an electrolyte, which can be recycled from the brine waste (0.96&#8197;M NaCl) of alkaline seawater electrolysis (ASE). Mechanistic studies unveiled that cation of concentrated seawater dynamically prompted unsaturated interfacial water dissociation to provide protons for enhanced E&#8208;AHE. As a result, compared with freshwater, a twofold increase of FE of E&#8208;AHE was achieved on concentrated seawater&#8208;based electrolysis. We also demonstrated an integrated system of ASE and E&#8208;AHE for hydrogen and ethylene production, in which the obtained brine output from ASE was directly fed into E&#8208;AHE process without any further treatment for continuously cyclic operations. This innovative system delivered outstanding FE and selectivity of ethylene surpassed 97.0&#8201;% and 97.5&#8201;% across wide&#8208;industrial current density range (&#8804; 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. This work provides a significant advance of electrocatalytic ethylene production coupling with brine refining of seawater electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;The cation of concentrated seawater was demonstrated to promote C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Benefiting from this, FE of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is higher than 97&#8201;% at 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in concentrated seawater. An integrated system was designed for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and seawater.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene (E-AHE) is a promising alternative for thermal-catalytic process, yet it suffers from low current densities and efficiency. Here, we achieved a 71.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of E-AHE at a large partial current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; using concentrated seawater as an electrolyte, which can be recycled from the brine waste (0.96&#8197;M NaCl) of alkaline seawater electrolysis (ASE). Mechanistic studies unveiled that cation of concentrated seawater dynamically prompted unsaturated interfacial water dissociation to provide protons for enhanced E-AHE. As a result, compared with freshwater, a twofold increase of FE of E-AHE was achieved on concentrated seawater-based electrolysis. We also demonstrated an integrated system of ASE and E-AHE for hydrogen and ethylene production, in which the obtained brine output from ASE was directly fed into E-AHE process without any further treatment for continuously cyclic operations. This innovative system delivered outstanding FE and selectivity of ethylene surpassed 97.0&#8201;% and 97.5&#8201;% across wide-industrial current density range (&#8804; 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP = polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000 h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits the metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75% yield, 99% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization in Ag&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the substantial role of ammonia, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion has attracted increasing interest. Herein, we proposed a feasible strategy of p&#8208;d orbital hybridization via doping p&#8208;block metals in an Ag host, which drastically promotes the performance of nitrate adsorption and disassociation. Typically, a Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5 &#177; 1.85 % for NH3 at &#8208;0.4 V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3 &#177; 14.1 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2 % at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.1 A cm&#8208;2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high&#8208;quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi&#8208; and In&#8208;doped Ag catalysts. Moreover, when integrated into a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, such a SnAg cathode contributes to a superior energy density of 639 Wh L&#8208;1, high power density of 18.1 mW cm&#8208;2, and continuous NH3 production.</dc:description>

Typically, a Sn-doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5 &#177; 1.85 % for NH3 at -0.4 V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3 &#177; 14.1 mg h-1 mgcat.-1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2 % at an ampere-level current density of 1.1 A cm-2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6 mg h-1 cm-2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high-quality fertilizer.

         <title>Halogen Tailoring of Platinum Electrocatalyst with High CO Tolerance for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of platinum for the CO oxidation depends on the interaction of electron donation and back&#8208;donation at the platinum center. Here we demonstrate that the platinum bromine nanoparticles with electron&#8208;rich properties on bromine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (PtBr NPs/Br&#8208;GDY), which is formed by bromine ligand and constitutes an electrocatalyst with a high CO&#8208;resistant for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst showed peak mass activity for MOR as high as 10.4 A mgPt&#8722;1, which is 20.8 times higher than the 20% Pt/C. The catalyst also showed robust long&#8208;term stability with slight current density decay after 100 hours at 35 mA cm&#8722;2. Structural characterization, experimental, and theoretical studies show that the electron donation from bromine makes the surface of platinum catalysts highly electron&#8208;rich, and can strengthen the adsorption of CO as well as enhance &#960; back&#8208;donation of Pt to weaken the C&#8722;O bond to facilitate CO electrooxidation and enhance catalytic performance during MOR. The results highlight the importance of electron&#8208;rich structure among active sites in Pt&#8208;halogen catalysts and provide detailed insights into the new mechanism of CO electrooxidation to overcome CO poisoning at the Pt center on an orbital level.</dc:description>

         <title>The Coking of a Solid Catalyst Rationalized with Combined Raman and Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of carbon deposits is a major deactivation pathway for solid catalysts. Studying coking on industrially relevant catalysts is, however, often challenging due to the sample heterogeneity. That is especially true for zeolite&#8208;containing catalysts where fluorescence often hampers their characterization with Raman spectroscopy. We turned this disadvantage into an advantage and combined Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy to study the coking behavior of an equilibrium catalyst material used for fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. The results presented illustrate that this approach can yield new insights in the physicochemical processes occurring within zeolite&#8208;containing catalyst particles during their coking process. Ex situ analyses of single catalyst particles revealed considerable intra&#8208;sample heterogeneities. The sample&#8208;averaged Raman spectra showed a higher degree of graphitization when the sample was exposed to more hexane, while the sample&#8208;averaged fluorescence lifetime showed no significant trend. Simultaneous in situ Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy, used to follow the coking of single particles, gave more insights in the changing fluorescence dynamics. The rise and decline of the average fluorescence lifetime suggested the prolonged presence of smaller coke species that are quenched more and more by adjacent larger polyaromatics acting as F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance&#8208;energy&#8208;transfer acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60 V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50 V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11 times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3M MgBr2 (at 0.6V) and up to 4&#8208;5 times higher adsorption capacity with 3M MgCl2 (at 1V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8208;20% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100 cycles of operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive B&#8208;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Delocalization in Extended Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8208;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the p&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8 eV for the dimer and 1.7 eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731 nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds and In&#8208;situ Photoinduced Metallic Bi0/Ni0&#160;Accelerating Z&#8208;scheme Charge Transfer of BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH for Highly Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For heterojunction system, the lack of stable interfacial driving force and definite charge transfer channel makes the charge separation and transfer efficiency unsatisfactory. The photoreaction mechanism occurring at the interface also receives less attention. Herein, a 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with large&#8208;area contact featured by abundant interfacial hydrogen bonds and a strong interfacial electric field (IEF) is synthesized, and in&#8208;situ photoinduced metallic species assisting charge transfer mechanism is demonstrated. The hydrogen bonds between O atoms from BiOBr and H atoms from NiFe&#8208;LDH induce a significant interfacial charge redistribution, establishing a robust IEF. Notably, during photocatalytic reaction, Bi0 and Ni0 are in&#8208;situ isolated from BiOBr and NiFe&#8208;LDH in heterojunction, which separately act as electron transport mediator and electron trap to further accelerate charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2%. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the existence of Bi0 strengthens the IEF. Therefore, high&#8208;speed spatial charge separation is realized in Bi0/BiOBr@Ni0/NiFe&#8208;LDH, leading to a prominent photocatalytic activity with a tetracycline removal ratio of 88.3% within 7 minutes under visible&#8208;light irradiation and the presence of persulfate, far exceeding majority of photocatalysts reported previously. This study provides valid insights for designing hydrogen bonding heterojunction systems, and advances mechanistic understanding on in&#8208;situ photoreaction at interfaces.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808 nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Blade&#8208;Coating (100)&#8208;Oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Films via Crystal Surface Energy Regulation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite  Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5 mol% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of phase&#8208;pure, highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16% (~26.5% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Group&#8208;driven Competing Mechanism in Electrochemical Reaction and Adsorption/Desorption Processes toward High&#8208;capacity Aluminum&#8208;Porphyrin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonaqueous organic aluminum batteries are considered as promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices due to stable ionic liquid electrolytes and Al metals. However, the stability and capacity of organic positive electrodes are limited by their inherent high solubility and low active organic molecules. To address such issues, here porphyrin compounds with rigid molecular structures present stable and reversible capability in electrochemically storing AlCl2+. Comparison between the porphyrin molecules with electron&#8208;donating groups (TPP&#8208;EDG) and with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (TPP&#8208;EWG) suggests that EDG is responsible for increasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, resulting in decreased redox potentials. On the other hand, EWG is associated with decreasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to promoted redox potentials. EDG and EWG play critical roles in regulating electron density of porphyrin &#960; bond and&#160;electrochemical energy storage kinetics behavior. The competitive mechanism between electrochemical redox reaction and de/adsorption processes suggests that TPP&#8208;OCH3 delivers the highest specific capacity ~171.8 mAh g&#8208;1, approaching a record in the organic Al batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Low&#8208;loaded PdOx/AlSiOx for Ethylene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene dimerization is an industrial process that is currently carried out using homogeneous catalysts. Here we present a highly active heterogeneous catalyst containing minute amounts of atomically dispersed Pd. It requires no co&#8208;catalyst(s) or activator(s) and significantly outperforms previously reported catalysts tested under similar reaction conditions. The selectivity to C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;hydrocarbons was about 80% and 10% at 42% ethylene conversion at 200&#176;C using an industrially relevant feed containing 50 vol% ethylene, respectively. Our&#160;kinetic and catalyst characterization experiments complemented by density functional theory calculations provide molecular insights into the local environment of isolated Pd(II)Ox species and their role in achieving high activity in the target reaction. When the developed catalyst was rationally integrated with a Mo&#8208;containing olefin metathesis catalyst in the same reactor, the formed butenes reacted with ethylene to propylene with a selectivity of 98% at about 24% ethylene conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum Alkyl Induced Isomerization of Group IV meso Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of group IV metallocene precatalysts for the polymerization of propylene generally yields two different isomers: The racemic isomer that produces isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the meso isomer that produces atactic polypropylene (aPP). Due to its poor physical properties, aPP has very limited applications. To avoid obtaining blends of both polymers and thus diminish the mechanical and thermal properties of iPP, the meso metallocene complexes need to be separated from the racemic ones tediously &#8211;rendering the metallocene&#8208;based polymerization of propylene industrially far less attractive than the Ziegler/Natta process. To overcome this issue, we established an isomerization protocol to convert meso metallocene complexes into their racemic counterparts. This protocol increased the yield of iPP by 400% while maintaining the polymer&#8217;s excellent physical properties and was applicable to both hafnocene and zirconocene complexes, as well as different precatalyst activation methods. Through targeted variation of the ligand frameworks, methoxy groups at the indenyl moieties were found to be the structural motifs responsible for an isomerization to take place &#8211;this experimental evidence was confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Liquid injection field desorption ionization mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance studies, allowed the proposal of an isomerization mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8208;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8208;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8208;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH).&#160;An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47 &#177; 0.03 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 (911.87 &#177; 0.05 mmol&#183;gBi&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.0 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1 (0.2 g&#183;gcat&#8208;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8208;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8208;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#9679;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#9679;NH2 radical. The &#160;BiSAs&#160;sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the&#160;nucleophilic attack of&#160;&#9679;NH2&#160;radical at the&#160;&#9679;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8208;N bond formation.&#160;This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8208;N coupling mechanism and offers an alternative and intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8208;N compounds.</dc:description>

Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon-nitrogen (C-N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C-N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C-N compounds.

         <title>Steric Hindrance Engineering to Modulate the Closed Pores Formation of Polymer&#8208;Derived Hard Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The closed pores play a critical role in improving the sodium storage capacity of hard carbon (HC) anode, however, their formation mechanism as well as the efficient modulation strategy at molecular level in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs is still lacking. In this work, the steric hindrance effect has been proposed to create closed pores in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs for the first time through grafting the aromatic rings within and between the main chains in the precursor. The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric&#8208;hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3 mAh/g at 0.1 C, improved rate performance (210.7 mAh/g at 5 C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4% over 1000 cycles at 2C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;derived HC anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regional Functionalization Molecular Design Strategy: A Key to Enhancing the Efficiency of Multi&#8208;Resonance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we propose a regional functionalization molecular design strategy that enables independent control of distinct pivotal parameters through distinct segments of the molecule. Three novel blue emitters A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN, have been successfully synthesized by integrating highly rigid and three&#8208;dimensional adamantane&#8208;containing spirofluorene units into the MR framework. These molecules form two distinctive functional parts: part 1 comprises a boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;MR framework with adjacent benzene and fluorene units forming a central luminescent core characterized by an exceptionally rigid planar geometry, allowing for narrow FWHM values; part 2 includes peripheral mesitylene, benzene, and adamantyl groups, creating a unique three&#8208;dimensional "umbrella&#8208;like" conformation to mitigate intermolecular interactions and suppress exciton annihilation. The resulting A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN exhibit remarkably narrow FWHM values ranging from 18 to 14 nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Particularly, OLEDs based on DA&#8208;BN and A&#8208;DBN demonstrate outstanding efficiencies of 35.0% and 34.3%, with FWHM values as low as 22 nm and 25 nm, respectively, effectively accomplishing the integration of high color purity and high device performance.</dc:description>

         <title>5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin: a Stable Antiaromatic [20]Pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0) Displaying Remarkable Oxidative Self&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin and its BF2 complex were synthesized by double SNAr reaction of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;BODIPY with a&#8208;(pyro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)dipyrrin as the first examples of meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted orangarin. These orangarins, delineated as [20]pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0), are strongly antiaromatic but rather stable. The free base orangarin was coupled by oxidation with MnO2 to give a 11,11&#8217;&#8208;linked dimer, a cyclooctatetraene(COT)&#8208;centered trimer, and a spiro&#8208;trimer. Fused COT&#8208;centered 3H&#8208;orangarin dimer was oxidized to the corresponding 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer, which was further coupled to give a triply COT centered 2H&#8208;orangarin tetramer. 3H&#8208;Orangarin oligomers are all antiaromatic as evinced by extremely low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted 1H NMR signals of the inner NH and ill&#8208;defined absorption spectra with broad tails. In contrast, COT&#8208;centered 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer and tetramer show moderately low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted NH signals and intense NIR absorbance over 900 nm, suggesting the effective p&#8208;conjugation through the COT bridge and almost non&#8208;antiaromatic character. These orangarin oligomers exhibit many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interactions. Regardless of the different aromatic characters, all the orangarin monomers and oligomers exhibit very rapid excited&#8208;state decays.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8208;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd located synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;inspired Polyurea Ionogel with Mechanical Robustness, Self&#8208;Healing, and Fluorescence Enabled by Hyperbranched Cluster Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionogels are promising for soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining their performance and potential applications. However, simultaneously achieving mechanical toughness, low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence using existing network structures is challenging. Drawing inspiration from jellyfish, we propose a novel hierarchical crosslinking network structure design for in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA) to fabricate polyurea ionogels to overcome these challenges. Leveraging the disparate reactivity of isocyanate groups, we induce the in situ formation of HCA through competing reactions, enhancing toughness and imparting the clustering&#8208;triggered emission of ionogel. This synergy between supramolecular interactions in the network and plasticizing effect in ionic liquid leads to reduced hysteresis of the ionogel. Furthermore, the incorporation of NCO&#8208;terminated prepolymer with dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds (NPU) enables self&#8208;healing and enhances stretchability. Our investigations highlight the significant influence of HCA on ionogel performance, showcasing mechanical robustness including high strength (3.5 MPa), exceptional toughness (5.5 MJ m&#8722;3), resistance to puncture, and low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, as well as&#160;fluorescence, surpassing conventional dynamic crosslinking approaches. This network design strategy is versatile and can meet the various demands of flexible electronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral Electrocatalysts Enable Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe an innovative approach to the&#160;asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes facilitated by a newly designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst. The highly efficient bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation, while&#160;simultaneously providing&#160;remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. Additionally, this novel catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stereoselective control comparable to conventional catalytic systems. As a result, this strategy&#160;provides a new avenue for versatile asymmetric electrochemistry. The&#160;electrooxidation&#160;of diverse phenols enables&#160;the C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H oxidative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies by control experiments and cyclic voltammetry&#160;analysis demonstrate possible reaction pathways and the origin of enantio&#8208;induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures.&#160;Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&#8208;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2&#8208;[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4&#8208;I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n&#8208;&#960; and anion&#8208;&#960; stacking in solid&#8208;state C4&#8208;I. Photophysical studies of C4&#8208;I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (kISC) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near&#8208;pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X&#8208;ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4&#8208;I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79 nGy&#183;s&#8208;1. This work would provide a rational design concept and open up an appealing road for developing efficient organic scintillators with tunable emission, strong X&#8208;ray attenuation ability, and excellent scintillator performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rhodamine&#8208;Spiropyran Conjugate Empowering Tunable Mechanochromism in Polymers under Multiple Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force&#8208;responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single&#8208;component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi&#8208;modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh&#8208;SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits. The mechanochromic behaviors of the Rh&#8208;SP&#8208;linked polymers under sonication and compression are thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in force and the light&#8208;controlled relaxation process. Non&#8208;sequential ring&#8208;opening of the two subunits under force is identified, endowing high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism. Light&#8208;induced differential ring&#8208;closing reactions of the two subunits, together with the acidichromism of the SP moiety, are employed to engineer elastomers with programmable and wide&#8208;spectrum colors. Our work presents an effective strategy for highly appreciable and regulable mechanochromic functionality, and also provides new insights into the rupture mechanisms of &#960;&#8208;fused mechanophores, as well as how the stimuli history controls stress accumulation in polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ribosome&#8208;Free Translation up to Pentapeptides via Template Walk on RNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The origin of translation is one of the most difficult problems of molecular evolution. Identifying molecular systems that translate an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence in the absence of ribosomes and enzymes is a challenge. Recently, single&#8208;nucleotide translation via coupling of 5' phosphoramidate&#8208;linked amino acids to 2'/3'&#8208;aminoacyl transfer&#8208;NMPs, as directed by the sequence of an RNA template, was demonstrated for three of the four canonical nucleotides. How single&#8208;nucleotide translation could be expanded to include all four bases and to produce longer peptides without translocation along the template strand remained unclear. Using transfer strands of increasing length containing any of the four bases that interrogate adjacent positions along the template, we now show that pentapeptides can be produced in coupling reactions and subsequent hydrolytic release in situ. With 2'/3'&#8208;aminoacylated mono&#8208;, di, tri&#8208; and tetranucleotides we thus show just how efficient translation can be without biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8211;BF3&#8211;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of reactivity and how it changes upon anion binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10 anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents that were selected to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized a&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2 hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8211;BF3&#8211; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8211;BF3&#8211; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a rapid, room&#8208;temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating additive to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine&#8208;based COFs. The resulting COFs display high porosity and crystallinity, with COF&#8208;102 being the first example of a mechanochemically prepared 3D COF, exhibiting a surface area of ca.&#160;2,500&#160;m2&#160;g&#8211;1. Mechanochemistry enabled a &gt;20&#8208;fold reduction in solvent use and ~100&#8208;fold reduction in reaction time compared with solvothermal methods, providing target COFs quantitatively with no additional work&#8208;up besides vacuum drying. Real&#8208;time Raman spectroscopy permitted the first quantitative kinetic analysis of COF mechanosynthesis, while transferring the reaction design to Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enabled synthesis of multi&#8208;gram amounts of the target COFs (tested up to 10 g).</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8211;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergizing Steric Hindrance and Stacking Interactions to Facilitate the Controlled Assembly of Multiple 41 Metalla&#8208;Knots and Pseudo&#8208;Solomon Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a noncoplanar terphenyl served as building block to synthesize a novel 3,3'&#8208;substituted bipyridyl ligand (L1) which further reacted with binuclear half&#8208;sandwich units A/B, giving rise to two aesthetical 41 metalla&#8208;knots in high yields via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, given the inherent compactness of the 41 metalla&#8208;knots, it creates favorable conditions for the emergence of steric repulsion. We focused on progressively introducing nitrogen atoms featuring lone pair electrons (LPEs) into ligand L1 to manipulate the balance of H&#183;&#183;&#183;H/LPEs&#183;&#183;&#183;LPEs steric repulsion during the assembly process, ultimately achieving controlled assembly from 41 metalla&#8208;knots to the pseudo&#8208;Solomon link and then to molecular tweezer&#8208;like assembly facilitated by stacking interactions. All the assemblies were well characterized by solution&#8208;state NMR techniques, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The evolutionary process of topological architectures is equivalent to visualizing the synergistic effect of steric hindrance and stacking interactions on structural assembly, providing a new avenue for achieving the controlled synthesis of different topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of a Stable Prefunctionalized Silver Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOPhC&#8801;C)6]SbF6, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosheet Induced Inverse Growth of Negative Valency Au Clusters for Tumor Treatment by Enhanced Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster aggregation states are thermodynamically favored at the subnanoscale, for which an inverse growth from nanoparticles to clusters may be realized on subnanometer supports. Herein, we develop Au&#8208;polyoxometalate&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Au&#8208;POM&#8208;LDH) sub&#8208;1 nm nanosheets (Sub&#8208;APL) based on the above strategy, where sub&#8208;1 nm Au clusters with negative valence are generated by the in&#8208;situ disintegration of Au nanoparticles on POM&#8208;LDH supports. Sub&#8208;1 nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for glutathione (GSH) depletion. The closely connected sub&#8208;1 nm Au with negative valence and POM hetero&#8208;units can promote the separation of hole&#8208;electrons, resulting in the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound (US). Besides, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger chemodynamic therapy (CDT) simultaneously, further enhancing the oxidative stress. Consequently, the Sub&#8208;APL present 2&#8208;fold ROS generation under US and 7&#8208;fold GSH depletion compared to the discrete Au and POM&#8208;LDH mixture. Therefore, the serious imbalance of redox in the TME caused by the sharp increase of ROS and rapid decrease of GSH leads to death of tumor ultimately.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has&#160;minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by&#160;frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Helmholtz Plane Enables Robust F&#8208;Rich Interface for Long&#8208;Life and High&#8208;Safe Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) is the most commonly used anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer formed in carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes has an imperceptible dissolution tendency and a sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, resulting in unsatisfactory performance of the HC anode. Given that electrode/electrolyte interface property is highly dependent on the configuration of Helmholtz plane, we filtrate proper solvents by PFBE (PF6&#8208; anion binding energy) and CAE (carbon absorption energy) and disclose the function of chosen TFEP to reconstruct the Helmholtz plane and regulate the SEI film on HC anode. Benefiting from the preferential adsorption tendency on HC surface and strong anion&#8208;dragging interaction of TFEP, a robust and thin anion&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich SEI film is established, which greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The rationally designed TFEP&#8208;based electrolyte endows Na||HC half&#8208;cell and 2.8 Ah HC||Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 pouch cell with excellent rate capability, long cycle life, high safety and low&#8208;temperature adaptability. It is believed that this insightful recognition of tuning interface properties will pave a new avenue on the design of compatible electrolyte for low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;life, and high&#8208;safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable T&#8208;Shaped Planar Silyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of an unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt. The non&#8208;classical geometry enables this silyl anion to feature a silicon&#8208;centred HOMO, LUMO and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. It not only exhibits nucleophilic behaviour but also undergoes oxidative additions to CO2 and arylisonitrile. Notably, it represents the first example of silyl anions capable of cleaving C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silyl anions have garnered significant attention due to their synthetic abilities. However, previously reported silyl anions have been limited to either trigonal&#8208;pyramidal or trigonal&#8208;planar geometries, which confine them primarily as nucleophiles in substitution reactions. Herein, we report the isolation of the unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt 2 by employment of a geometrically constrained triamido pincer ligand. Theoretical calculations disclosed that the silicon centre in 2 possesses both a lone pair of electrons and an empty 3pz orbital. In addition to nucleophilic substitution reactions with Ph3PAuCl and W(CO)6, 2 readily undergoes oxidative additions with CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylisonitrile at room temperature. Furthermore, under mild conditions, compound 2 cleaves Csp2&#8722;H, Csp2&#8722;H, and H&#8722;H bonds in 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene, an intramolecular iPr group, and dihydrogen, representing the first examples of C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H activations mediated by a silyl anion, respectively. This work unveils new reactivity of silyl anions owing to the non&#8208;classical geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Proportion of Grain Boundaries in Zinc Metal Anode Spontaneously Inhibiting Dendrites Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries create abundant nucleation sites, accelerating zinc nucleation and growth rates allowing for the 2D growth kinetics. This offers advantages over the traditional 3D instantaneous nucleation mode of the commercial zinc foil, constrained by limited nucleation sites and kinetics associated with nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an attractive electrochemical energy storage solution for their budget and safe properties. However, dendrites and uncontrolled side reactions in anodes detract the cycle life and energy density of the batteries. Grain boundaries in metals are generally considered as the source of the above problems but we present a diverse result. This study introduces an ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries on zinc electrodes through femtosecond laser bombardment to enhance stability of zinc metal/electrolyte interface. The ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries promotes the homogenization of zinc growth potential, to achieve uniform nucleation and growth, thereby suppressing dendrite formation. Additionally, the abundant active sites mitigate the side reactions during the electrochemical process. Consequently, the 15&#8197;&#956;m Fs&#8722;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves an energy density of 249.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and operates for over 60 cycles at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 23&#8201;%. The recognition of the favorable influence exerted by UP&#8208;GBs paves a new way for other metal batteries.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Distal C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination of Aliphatic Amines as a Gateway for Forging Nitrogen&#8208;Containing sp3 Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in unprotected aliphatic amines has been developed, achieved by tuning of the electronics properties of the proximal C&#8722;H bonds via substrate protonation. Consecutive intramolecular cyclization of alkyl bromide offered a series of N&#8208;containing heterocycles characterized by high ring strains. Moreover, the resulting C(sp3)&#8722;Br serves as a synthetic linchpin can be readily transferred to C(sp3)&#8722;C, N, O bonds, enabling diverse functionalization at previously untouched C(sp3)&#8722;H sites.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new strategy that rapidly and reliably incorporates bromine atoms at distal, secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H sites in aliphatic amines with an excellent and predictable site&#8208;selectivity pattern. The resulting halogenated building blocks serve as versatile linchpins to enable a series of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;formations at remote C(sp3) sites, thus offering a new modular and unified platform that expediates the access to advanced sp3 architectures possessing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles of interest in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>[2.2]Benzoindenophane&#8208;Based Chiral Indenyl Ligands: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both the development of optically pure chiral indenyl rhodium(IndxRh) catalysts and IndxRh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation are challenging and seldom reported. Herein, a class of chiral indenyl ligands bearing a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton is presented. It is convenient to synthesize and easy to modify (13 variations are shown). Importantly, its coordination to rhodium is face&#8208;specific. Moreover, the utilities of its IndxRh catalysts have been demonstrated by two asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Development of chiral indenyl ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation is a longstanding challenge, and extremely few successes have been achieved. In this paper, we describe a class of readily accessible, facilely tunable and user&#8208;friendly chiral indenyl ligands featuring a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton via a divergent synthesis strategy. The corresponding chiral indenyl rhodium catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of O&#8208;Boc hydroxybenzamide with alkenes to give various chiral dihydroisoquinolone products (up to 97&#8201;% yield, up to 98&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of carboxylic acids with alkynes was also successfully accomplished, providing a range of axially chiral isocoumarins (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 94&#8201;% ee). Notably, this represents the first example of enantioselective transition metal catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation/oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes to construct isocoumarins. Given many attractive features of this class of indenyl ligands, such as convenient synthesis, high tunability and exclusive face&#8208;selectivity of coordination, its applications in more catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;H activation and in other asymmetric catalysis are foreseen.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Based Multimeric Aptamer Generation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface&#8208;based room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for multimeric aptamer generation alongside relevant surface bio&#8208;functionalization were employed on nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) working electrodes (WEs) for developing highly sensitive and selective NMIs multimeric aptasensors.







Abstract
Multimeric aptamers have gained more attention than their monomeric counterparts due to providing more binding sites for target analytes, leading to increased affinity. This work attempted to engineer the surface&#8208;based generation of multimeric aptamers by employing the room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique and chemically modified primers for developing a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor. The multimeric aptamers, generated through surface RCA, are hybridized to modified spacer primers, facilitating the positioning of the aptamers in the proximity of sensing surfaces. These multimeric aptamers can be used as bio&#8208;receptors for capturing specific targets. The surface amplification process was fully characterized, and the optimal amplification time for biosensing purposes was determined, using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SP). Interestingly, multimeric aptasensors produced considerably higher response signals and affinity (more than 10&#8208;fold), as well as higher sensitivity (almost 4&#8208;fold) compared to monomeric aptasensors. Furthermore, the impact of surface structures on the response signals was studied by utilizing both flat working electrodes (WEs) and nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) WEs. The NMIs multimeric aptasensors showed significantly higher sensitivity in buffer and saliva media with the limit of detection less than 2&#8197;fg/ml. Finally, the developed NMIs multimeric aptasensors were clinically challenged with several saliva patient samples.

     alt="Surface-Based Multimeric Aptamer Generation and Bio-Functionalization for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel surface-based room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for multimeric aptamer generation alongside relevant surface bio-functionalization were employed on nano-/microislands (NMIs) working electrodes (WEs) for developing highly sensitive and selective NMIs multimeric aptasensors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multimeric aptamers have gained more attention than their monomeric counterparts due to providing more binding sites for target analytes, leading to increased affinity. This work attempted to engineer the surface-based generation of multimeric aptamers by employing the room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique and chemically modified primers for developing a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor. The multimeric aptamers, generated through surface RCA, are hybridized to modified spacer primers, facilitating the positioning of the aptamers in the proximity of sensing surfaces. These multimeric aptamers can be used as bio-receptors for capturing specific targets. The surface amplification process was fully characterized, and the optimal amplification time for biosensing purposes was determined, using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP). Interestingly, multimeric aptasensors produced considerably higher response signals and affinity (more than 10-fold), as well as higher sensitivity (almost 4-fold) compared to monomeric aptasensors. Furthermore, the impact of surface structures on the response signals was studied by utilizing both flat working electrodes (WEs) and nano-/microislands (NMIs) WEs. The NMIs multimeric aptasensors showed significantly higher sensitivity in buffer and saliva media with the limit of detection less than 2&#8197;fg/ml. Finally, the developed NMIs multimeric aptasensors were clinically challenged with several saliva patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Engineering of Myoglobin by Cofactor Substitution to Enhance Cyclopropanation Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;diverse myoglobins containing four different cofactors with different redox potentials (&#8722;198 to +147&#8197;mV vs. NHE) were studied as catalysts for alkene cyclopropanation through carbene transfer. Myoglobin with a positive redox potential is highly reactive for electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, such as 1&#8208;octene. In contrast, myoglobin with a negative redox potential accelerates the formation of a detectable carbene intermediate.







Abstract
Design of metal cofactor ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of metalloenzymes. We investigated a carbene transfer reaction catalyzed by myoglobins containing iron porphyrin cofactors with one and two trifluoromethyl groups at peripheral sites (FePorCF3 and FePor(CF3)2, respectively), native heme and iron porphycene (FePc). These four myoglobins show a wide range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potentials in the protein of +147&#8197;mV, +87&#8197;mV, +42&#8197;mV and &#8722;198&#8197;mV vs. NHE, respectively. Myoglobin reconstituted with FePor(CF3)2 has a more positive potential, which enhances the reactivity of a carbene intermediate with alkenes, and demonstrates superior cyclopropanation of inert alkenes, such as aliphatic and internal alkenes. In contrast, engineered myoglobin reconstituted with FePc has a more negative redox potential, which accelerates the formation of the intermediate, but has low reactivity for inert alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that myoglobin with FePor(CF3)2 generates an undetectable active intermediate with a radical character. In contrast, this reaction catalyzed by myoglobin with FePc includes a detectable iron&#8211;carbene species with electrophilic character. This finding highlights the importance of redox&#8208;focused design of the iron porphyrinoid cofactor in hemoproteins to tune the reactivity of the carbene transfer reaction.

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Tafbromin Selectively Targets the TAF1 Bromodomain 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinolone pseudo&#8208;natural product Tafbromin was identified as an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling&#8208;induced osteogenesis. Tafbromin binds to the second bromodomain of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1) with high selectivity over other bromodomains and suppresses the expression of Hedgehog target genes and alkaline phosphatase.







Abstract
Phenotypic assays detect small&#8208;molecule bioactivity at functionally relevant cellular sites, and inherently cover a variety of targets and mechanisms of action. They can uncover new small molecule&#8208;target pairs and may give rise to novel biological insights. By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoline (PQ) pseudo&#8208;natural product (PNP) class of osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.

         <title>Creating High&#8208;entropy Single Atoms on Transition Disulfides through Substrate&#8208;induced Redox Dynamics for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt during the HER.







Abstract
The controllable anchoring of multiple metal single&#8208;atoms (SAs) into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while marrying the concentration&#8208;complex multimetallic SAs and high&#8208;entropy SAs (HESAs) into one SAC system remains a substantial challenge. Here, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports, which can precisely control the doping location of SAs. Specially, the contents of SAs can continuously increase until the accessible Mo atoms on TMDs carriers are completely replaced by SAs, thus allowing the of much higher metal contents. In&#8208;depth mechanistic study shows that the well&#8208;controlled synthesis of multimetallic SAs and HESAs is realized by controlling the reversible redox reaction occurred on the TMDs/TM ion interface. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a variety of SAs&#8208;TMDs were applied to hydrogen evolution reaction. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt. Thus, our work will broaden the family of single&#8208;atom catalysts and provide a new guideline for the rational design of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.

Abstract
We report an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation using readily available 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans as the reaction pattern. The redox&#8208;neutral strategy, based on cheap, non&#8208;toxic, and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysts, exploits triazole assistance to promote a cascade C&#8722;H alkylation, benzofuran ring&#8208;opening and insertion into a Fe&#8722;N bond, to form highly functionalized isoquinolones. Detailed mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations fully disclosed the manifold of the iron catalysis.

Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has gained significant attention in drug discovery due to their potential to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Here, we present a mild and scalable Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with ynamides, yielding a diverse array of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. These products offer valuable starting materials for the construction of novel functionalized bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of ynamides to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated enolate and keteniminium ion. We expect that these findings will encourage utilization of complex bioisosteres and foster further investigation into BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.

         <title>Aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;Diazadiborole Featuring an Unsymmetrical B=B Entity: A Versatile Synthon for Unusual Boron Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole, a BN analogue of cyclopentadienide. Featuring an unsymmetrical B=B entity, this species readily undergoes redox, insertion, addition, and cycloaddition reactions for the synthesis of unusual boron heterocycles. The ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion have been witnessed during these transformations.







Abstract
The replacement of a CC unit with an isoelectronic BN unit in aromatic systems can give rise to molecules and materials with fascinating properties. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole species, 2, featuring an unprecedented 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic BN&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that is isoelectronic to cyclopentadienide (Cp&#8722;). Bearing an unsymmetrical B=B entity, 2 exhibits reactivity toward oxidants, protic reagents, electrophiles, and unsaturated substrates. This reactivity facilitates the synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and bicyclic organoboron derivatives through mechanisms including ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion. These findings reveal innovative synthetic routes to BN&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds via desymmetrization, affording unique building blocks for synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
The formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries is achieved. The two&#8208;electron reduction products feature a unique P42&#8722; structure and can act as a source of P3&#8722;. The treatment of these phosphorus containing products with electrophiles under mild conditions results in the formation of different phosphines. This approach eliminates the need for high temperatures and/or high pressures, which are commonly required in industrial processes for the preparation of useful phosphines.The activation and further functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) by main group complexes has become an increasingly studied topic in recent times. Herein, we report the controlled formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries from the selective reaction of P4 with dialumenes, ([L(IiPr)Al]2) (1: L=Tripp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; 2: L=tBu2MeSi; IiPr=[MeCN(iPr)]2C)). The two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction product of P4 features a P42&#8722; structure and is shown to be able to act as a source of P3&#8722;. Treatments of different electrophiles (e.g., chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl), iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI), HCl, or acetyl chloride (CH3COCl)) with these alanes under mild conditions gave the corresponding phosphines (e.g., P(SiMe3)3, PH3, or P(COCH3)3).

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8211;Active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We inserted Mn dopants in Co4N, to promote the formation of high&#8208;valence Co4+ during the pre&#8208;catalyst activation process. The energy barrier of phase transformation from CoOOH to CoO2 was lowered by introducing J&#8211;T active Mn3+ cations, because the violent distortion of the Mn3+ (t32ge1g)&#8208;centered octahedra MnO6 reduces the structural stability, and facilitates the H desorption. The consistent relationship between the J&#8211;T dopants and the deep&#8208;oxidation process is proved, and this concept can be extended to other elements. Moreover, the lattice oxygen in Mn doped CoO2 (Mn&#8208;CoO2) is activated to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the direct formation of oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (

) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn&#8208;doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8211;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of the catalyst's electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.

         <title>Trigonal Planar [PN3]4&#8722; Anion in the Nitridophosphate Oxide Ba3[PN3]O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present Ba3[PN3]O, containing the first [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Starting from commercial availably starting materials, we successfully synthesized this compound by a medium pressure reaction using the hot isostatic press. The crystal structure was elucidated by combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM&#8208;EDX, LCC and MAS NMR, whereby the unambiguous assignment of O/N was verified successfully.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates, with their primary structural motif of isolated or condensed PN4 tetrahedra, meet many requirements for high performance materials. Their properties are associated with their structural diversity, which is mainly limited by this specific building block. Herein, we present the alkaline earth metal nitridophosphate oxide Ba3[PN3]O featuring a trigonal planar [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Ba3[PN3]O was obtained using a hot isostatic press by medium&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (MP/HT) at 200&#8197;MPa and 880&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group R

&lt;p&gt;We present Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]O, containing the first [PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Starting from commercial availably starting materials, we successfully synthesized this compound by a medium pressure reaction using the hot isostatic press. The crystal structure was elucidated by combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, SEM-EDX, LCC and MAS NMR, whereby the unambiguous assignment of O/N was verified successfully.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitridophosphates, with their primary structural motif of isolated or condensed PN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra, meet many requirements for high performance materials. Their properties are associated with their structural diversity, which is mainly limited by this specific building block. Herein, we present the alkaline earth metal nitridophosphate oxide Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]O featuring a trigonal planar [PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion. Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[PN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]O was obtained using a hot isostatic press by medium-pressure high-temperature synthesis (MP/HT) at 200&#8197;MPa and 880&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data in space group &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Iwao Ojiama on the occasion of his 80th birthdayA cylindrical molecule with D3&#8208;symmetry was found to serve as versatile vertices to form 2&#8208;dimensional, honeycomb networks of host&#8211;guest complexes. Varying the structural elements of the layered systems enabled a wide range of structural combinations to become accessible.







Abstract
Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8211;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, the stereochemistry of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.

         <title>Management of Triplet States in Modified Mononuclear Ruthenium(II) Complexes for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a Ru(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons to transition their excited state from 3MLCT to 3IL, is presented. RuP&#8208;4 catalyzes CO2 photoreduction to CO with unprecedented performance without additional photosensitizers.







Abstract
Controlling the interplay between relaxation and charge/energy transfer processes in the excited states of photocatalysts is crucial for the performance of artificial photosynthesis. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer triplet states (3MLCT*) of ruthenium(II) complexes are broadly implemented for photocatalysis, but an effective means of managing the triplets for enhanced photocatalysis has been lacking. Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP&#8208;4 decorated with anthracene, sub&#8208;picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to 3MLCT* leads to a charge&#8208;separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra&#8208;ligand triplet state (3IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited&#8208;state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP&#8208;4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited&#8208;state charge/energy flow for the development of long&#8208;lived 3IL multi&#8208;functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Approaching Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Voltage&#8208;Responsive Smart Prelithiation Separator with Surface&#8208;Engineered Sacrificial Lithium Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart lithium compensation strategy by introducing voltage&#8208;responsive prelithiation separator can staged release active lithium, regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries and extending their life. The separator's ability to absorb excess lithium below operating voltage protects the cathode from electrochemical failure or short circuit, enhancing safety and sustainability.







Abstract
The surge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries has heightened concerns regarding metal resource depletion and the environmental impact of spent batteries. Battery recycling has become paramount globally, but conventional techniques, while effective at extracting transition metals like cobalt and nickel from cathodes, often overlook widely used spent LiFePO4 due to its abundant and low&#8208;cost iron content. Direct regeneration, a promising approach for restoring deteriorated cathodes, is hindered by practicality and cost issues despite successful methods like solid&#8208;state sintering. Hence, a smart prelithiation separator based on surface&#8208;engineered sacrificial lithium agents is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic anionic and cationic redox, the prelithiation separator can intelligently release or intake active lithium via voltage regulation. The staged lithium replenishment strategy was implemented, successfully restoring spent LiFePO4&#8217;s capacity to 163.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a doubled life. Simultaneously, the separator can absorb excess active lithium up to approximately 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 below 2.5&#8197;V to prevent over&#8208;lithiation of the cathode This innovative, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective strategy paves the way for the direct regeneration of spent batteries, expanding the possibilities in the realm of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Vapor/Vapor&#8208;Solid Interfacial Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes on Alumina Hollow Fiber for Advanced Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) interfacial method, in which vapor&#8208;phase monomers were introduced onto polydopamine(PDA)&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm within 8&#8197;h, ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 membranes were successfully grown on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers substrate. The resulting filtration module exhibits exceptional stability and performance in continuous inside&#8208;out cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial&#8208;preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina). Through vapor&#8208;phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V&#8722;S interface. This enables one&#8208;step growth within 8&#8197;h, producing 100&#8197;nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80&#8197;h in continuous cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700&#8197;Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V&#8722;S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100&#8211;500&#8197;nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method's potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>New Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Layered Double Perovskite Halides: Synthesis, Structural Transition and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs) have been synthesized by variations of trivalent metal centers in the inorganic layer as well as modifications in the organic spacers. All the HLDPs display ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (kL) with notable anisotropy in&#160;kL&#160;observed for RP&#8208;HLDP (3N&#8208;CuIn) when&#160;measured parallel and perpendicular&#160;to layer stacking.







Abstract
Hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs), representing the two&#8208;dimensional manifestation of halide double perovskites, have elicited considerable interest owing to their intricate chemical bonding hierarchy and structural diversity. This intensified interest stems from the diverse options available for selecting alternating octahedral coordinated trivalent [M(III)] and monovalent metal centers [M(I)], along with the distinctive nature of the cationic organic amine located between the layers. Here, we have synthesized three new compounds with general formula (R&#8242;/R&#8242;&#8242;)4/2M(III)M(I)Cl8; where R&#8242;=C3H7NH3 (i.e. 3N) and R&#8242;&#8242;=NH3C4H8NH3 (i.e. 4N4); M(III)=In3+ or Ru3+; M(I)=Cu+ by simple solution&#8208;based acid precipitation method. The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)2CuInCl8 and (4N4)2CuRuCl8 adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)4CuInCl8 exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure. The alternative octahedra within the inorganic layer display distortions and tilting. Three compounds show temperature&#8208;dependent structural phase transitions where changes in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have been noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300&#8197;K range, marking a distinctive feature within the realm of HLDP systems. The RP&#8208;HLDP compound, (3N)4CuInCl8, demonstrates anisotropy in &#954;L while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow &#954;L of 0.15 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb&#8208;free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow &#954;L in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity and soft crystal structure, which resulted in low&#8208;energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat&#8208;carrying acoustic phonons.

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically compared the influence of phosphorescence emission intensity, lifetime, and wavelength on bioimaging performance, demonstrating that the phosphorescence lifetime is the primary factor. Importantly, the inherent ability of Fe ions to quench the phosphorescence of organic phosphorescent materials was verified. Finally, phosphorescent materials were designed for the specific imaging of liver tumors.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. In addition, there have been few reports on organic phosphorescent materials that specifically distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94&#8197;s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.

Abstract

The potential applications of [12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices were further investigated, and its bipolar behavior as a charge transport active layer was clearly observed.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan/bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene moieties, two pairs of tetraborated chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence enantiomers have been synthesized that show good photophysical and chiroptical properties. The sulfur atoms accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process.

Abstract
Chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold promise for circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and 3D displays. Herein, we present two pairs of tetraborated intrinsically axial CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials, R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH, with conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan and bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene as chiral sources, which effectively participate in the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals. Due to the heavy&#8208;atom effect, sulfur atoms are introduced to accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process and increase the efficiency of molecules. R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH manifest ultra&#8208;pure blue emission with a maximum at 458/459&#8197;nm with a full width at half maximum of 27&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;%/91&#8201;%, and dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;4/8.5&#215;10&#8722;4, respectively. Correspondingly, the CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit good performances with an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% and |gEL| factors of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.

         <title>A Highly Reversible Sn&#8208;Air Battery Possessing the Ultra&#8208;Low Charging Potential with the Assistance of Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Sn&#8208;air battery using Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti multi&#8208;functional catalytic cathode is proposed for the first time. Due to the heterogeneous Fe2O3@TiO2&#8208;induced high photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic performances, the corresponding Sn&#8208;air battery has achieved the ultra&#8208;low charge/discharge overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV and stably cycled for 160&#8197;hours under irradiation.







Abstract
Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000&#8197;mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti films are further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8211;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to activate oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. Density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charging kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo&#8208;assisted catalytic cathode design for new&#8208;type metal&#8208;air batteries.

         <title>pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density on Doping&#8208;Engineered Bismuth Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;doped metallic Bi catalyst was formed by the electrochemical reconstruction of Bi2S3, which delivers outstanding performance in converting CO2 to formate/formic acid across a range of pH conditions. The simultaneous production of formate on both cathode and anode was also achieved by coupling CO2 reduction reaction with glycerol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95&#8201;% at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95&#8201;%) with current densities from 100 to 1300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90&#8201;% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mechanistic Depiction of Photoinduced CO2 Reduction Catalysis on a Urea&#8208;Modified Iron Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pump&#8208;pump excitation strategy induces effective accumulation of charge on an FeIII&#8208;based urea&#8208;modified porphyrin as the fates of the photogenerated species are tracked through their optical transient absorption signatures. In the presence of CO2 as a substrate and H2O as a proton source, the two&#8208;electron accumulated species leads to CO2 activation and reduction, generating FeII&#8208;CO as a stable intermediate in the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light&#8208;induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea&#8208;modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick&#8208;started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.

         <title>In Situ Transformation of an Amorphous Supramolecular Coating to a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane to Trigger Selective Gas Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy has been used for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation. The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: methanol&#8208;activated monomer dissolution facilitates equilibrium shifts, and methanol&#8208;guided hydrogen bonding stabilizes the monomer in a thermodynamically favored state. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.







Abstract
We introduce a &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy, deploying solvent vapor as scaffolds, to fabricate high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes. This strategy can overcome the mismatch in processing conditions and crystal growth thermodynamics faced during the facile solution processing of the membrane. The procedure includes the vapor&#8208;trigged in situ transformation of dense amorphous supramolecules to crystalline HOF&#8208;16, with HOF&#8208;11 as the transient state. The mechanism involves a vapor&#8208;activated dissolution&#8208;precipitation equilibrium shifting and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided molecule rearrangement, elucidated through combined experimental and theoretical analysis. Upon removal of the molecular scaffolds, the resulting HOF&#8208;16 membranes showcase significant improvement in hydrogen separation performance over their amorphous counterparts and previously reported HOF membranes. The method's broad applicability is evidenced by successfully extending it to other substrates and HOF structures. This study provides a fundamental understanding of guest&#8208;induced ordered supramolecular assembly and paves the way for the advanced manufacture of high&#8208;performance HOF membranes for gas separation processes.

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

         <title>Redox Synergy: Enhancing Gas Sensing Stability in 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Balancing Metal Node and Ligand Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox innocent zinc metal center&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, with ligand&#8208;centered sensing active sites has been developed for NO2 sensing, which demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high selectivity without compromising the coordination bonds.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates in gas sensing, owing to their tunable porous structure and conductivity. Nevertheless, the reported gas sensing mechanisms heavily relied on electron transfer between metal nodes and gas molecules. Normally, the strong interaction between the metal sites and target gas molecule would result poor recovery and thus bad recycling property. Herein, we propose a redox synergy strategy to overcome this issue by balancing the reactivity of metal sites and ligands. A 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, was prepared for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensing, which was constructed from active ligands (hexahydroxyltricycloquinazoline, HHTQ) and inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+). Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that by utilizing only the redox interactions between ligands and NO2, not only high sensitivity and selectivity, but also excellent cycling stability in NO2 sensing could be achieved. In contrast, control experiments employing isostructural 2D c&#8208;MOFs with Cu/Ni metal nodes exhibited irreversible NO2 sensing. Our current work provides a new design strategy for gas sensing materials, emphasizing harnessing the redox activity of only ligands to enhance the stability of MOF sensing materials.

         <title>A Rechargeable "Rocking Chair" Type Zn&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rising global temperatures and critical energy shortages have spurred researches into CO2 fixation and conversion within the realm of energy storage such as Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. However, traditional Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries employ double&#8208;compartment electrolytic cells with separate carriers for catholytes and anolytes, diverging from the "rocking chair" battery mechanism. The specific energy of these conventional batteries is constrained by the solubility of discharge reactants/products in the electrolyte. Additionally, H2O molecules tend to trigger parasitic reactions at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, undermining the long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes. In this report, we introduce an innovative "rocking chair" type Zn&#8722;CO2 battery that utilizes a weak&#8208;acidic Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte compatible with both cathode and anode. This design minimizes side reactions on the Zn surface and leverages the high catalytic activity of the cathode material, allowing the battery to achieve a substantial discharge capacity of 6734 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintain performance over 65 cycles. Moreover, the successful production of pouch cells demonstrates the practical applicability of Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. Electrode characterizations confirm superior electrochemical reversibility, facilitated by solid discharge products of ZnCO3 and C. This work advances a "rocking chair" Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with enhanced specific energy and a reversible pathway, providing a foundation for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8722;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous nature of amines in drug compounds, bioactive molecules and natural products has fueled intense interest in their synthesis. Herein, we introduce a nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylic amination of methanol&#8208;activated allenols. This protocol affords a diverse array of functionalized allenylic amines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by employing bioactive amines as nucleophiles and conducting gram&#8208;scale reactions. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations elucidate the role of methanol as an activator in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, facilitating the oxidative addition of the C&#8211;O bond of allenols through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The remarkable outcomes arise from a rapid racemization of allenols enabled by the nickel catalyst and from highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of &#951;3&#8208;alkadienylnickel intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Linearly Arranged Multi&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Stacked Structure for Efficient Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent spatial interaction has become an intriguing and important tool for constructing optoelectronic molecules. In this study, we linearly attached three conjugated units in a multi &#960;&#8208;stacked manner by using just one trident bridge based on indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene. To achieve this structure, we improved the synthetic approach through double C&#8208;H activation, significantly simplifying the preparation process. Due to the proximity of the C10, C11, and C12 sites in indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene, we derived two novel donor|acceptor|donor (D|A|D) type molecules, 2DMB and 2DMFB, which exhibited closely packed intramolecular stacking, enabling efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer. This molecular construction is particularly suitable for developing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. With donor(s) and acceptor(s) constrained and separated within this spatially rigid structure, elevated radiative transition rates, and high photoluminescence quantum yields were achieved. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes incorporating 2DMB and 2DMFB demonstrated superior efficiency, achieving maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6% and 16.2%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation strategy that occurs under extraordinarily mild conditions, displays high functional group tolerance, and has a broad substrate scope. We conducted a detailed mechanistic study of the transformation, underpinning the further development of iron&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylative methodologies.







Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reaction under mild, base&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. The transformation uses readily available and structurally diverse carboxylic acids, iron photocatalyst, and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) derivatives as oxygenation reagents. The process exhibits a broad scope in acids possessing a wide range of stereoelectronic properties and functional groups. The developed reaction was applied to late&#8208;stage oxygenation of a series of bio&#8208;active molecules. The reaction leverages the ability of iron complexes to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals directly from carboxylic acids by photoinduced carboxylate&#8208;to&#8208;iron charge transfer. Kinetic, electrochemical, EPR, UV/Vis, HRMS, and DFT studies revealed that TEMPO has a triple role in the reaction: as an oxygenation reagent, an oxidant to turn over the Fe&#8208;catalyst, and an internal base for the carboxylic acid deprotonation. The obtained TEMPO adducts represent versatile synthetic intermediates that were further engaged in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions using commercial organo&#8208;photocatalysts and nucleophilic reagents.

         <title>Divalent Titanium via Reductive N&#8722;C Coupling of a TiIV Nitrido with &#960;&#8208;Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium nitride undergoes N&#8722;C bond coupling with carbon monoxide and isocyanides to form TiII cumulene complexes [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]&#8722; (E=O, NAd, NtBu). Oxidation of these affords the TiIII cumulene [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]. Further oxidation affords a TiIV bis&#8208;cumulene trans&#8208;[(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2]. Structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic studies (HFEPR, CW X&#8208;band, NMR and IR spectroscopies), including 15N isotopic labelling studies are presented and discussed to understand the bonding and topology.







Abstract
The nitrido&#8208;ate complex [(PN)2Ti(N){&#956;2&#8208;K(OEt2)}]2 (1) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reductively couples CO and isocyanides in the presence of DME or cryptand (Kryptofix222), to form rare, five&#8208;coordinate TiII complexes having a linear cumulene motif, [K(L)][(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, L=Kryptofix222, (2); E=NAd, L=3 DME, (3); E=NtBu, L=3 DME, (4); E=NAd, L=Kryptofix222, (5)). Oxidation of 2&#8211;5 with [Fc][OTf] afforded an isostructural TiIII center containing a neutral cumulene, [(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, (6); E=NAd (7), NtBu (8)) and characterization by CW X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy, revealed unpaired electron to be metal centric. Moreover, 1e&#8722; reduction of 6 and 7 in the presence of Kryptofix222cleanly reformed corresponding discrete TiII complexes 2 and 5, which were further characterized by solution magnetization measurements and high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, oxidation of 7 with [Fc*][B(C6F5)4] resulted in a ligand disproportionated TiIV complex having transoid carbodiimides, [(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2] (9). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their 15N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV and increasing order of &#960;&#8208;donation as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV, thus displaying more covalency in TiIII species. Lastly, we show a synthetic cycle whereby complex 1 can deliver an N&#8208;atom to CO and CNAd.

         <title>Expedited Synthesis of Metal Phosphides Maximizes Dispersion, Air Stability, and Catalytic Performance in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis based on cheap and safe precursors delivers a wide range of supported metal phosphides with small particle diameters and high dispersion. Ni2P/Al2O3 prepared in this fashion is a bench&#8208;stable catalyst that delivers activity on par with the Pd&#8208;based benchmark catalyst in alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have been hailed as potential replacements for scarce noble metal catalysts in many aspects of the hydrogen economy from hydrogen evolution to selective hydrogenation reactions. But the need for dangerous and costly phosphorus precursors, limited support dispersion, and low stability of the metal phosphide surface toward oxidation substantially lower the appeal and performance of metal phosphides in catalysis. We show here that a 1&#8208;step procedure that relies on safe and cheap precursors can furnish an air&#8208;stable Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3.2&#8197;nm nanoparticles. Ni2P/Al2O3&#8201;1&#8208;step is kinetically competitive with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst in selective hydrogenation catalysis, and a loading corresponding to 4&#8197;ppm Ni was sufficient to convert 0.1&#8197;mol alkyne. The 1&#8208;step synthetic procedure alters the surface ligand speciation of Ni2P/Al2O3, which protects the nanoparticle surface from oxidation, and ensures that 85&#8201;% of the initial catalytic activity was retained after the catalyst was stored under air for 1.5&#8197;years. Preparation of Ni2P on a variety of supports (silica, TiO2, SBA&#8208;15, ZrO2, C and HAP) as well as Co2P/Al2O3, Co2P/TiO2 and bimetallic NiCoP/TiO2 demonstrates the generality with which supported metal phosphides can be accessed in a safe and straightforward fashion with small sizes and high dispersion.

         <title>Catalytic Refining Lignin&#8208;Derived Monomers: Seesaw Effect between Nanoparticle and Single&#8208;Atom Pt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seesaw effect between Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles in the catalytic refining of lignin monomers, viz. demethoxylation on a single&#8208;atom catalyst versus deep deoxygenation on a nanoparticle, is disclosed. The weak hydrogen spillover behavior on SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H inhibits hydrogenation of the benzene ring and removal of the phenol hydroxyl group, presenting in a high demethoxylation selectivity.







Abstract
Pt automatically adsorbed on oxygen vacancy of TiO2 via an in situ interfacial redox reaction, resulting in atomically dispersion of Pt on TiO2. In the upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived 4&#8208;propylguaiacol, single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2&#8722;H achieved a conversion of 96.9&#8201;% and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% under 3&#8197;MPa H2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0&#8201;%. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H reduced the energy barrier of CAr&#8722;OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single&#8208;atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2&#8722;H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin&#8208;derived monomers and high stability. This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil&#8208;based 4&#8208;alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lissodendoric Acid A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy leading to the first total synthesis of lissodendoric acid A is reported. The 12&#8208;step synthesis centers on an enantiospecific Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of a strained azacyclic allene to construct the core of the natural product. The study demonstrates that strained cyclic allenes are valuable synthetic building blocks for total synthesis.







Abstract

         <title>piSTING: A Pocket&#8208;Independent Agonist Based on Multivalency&#8208;Driven STING Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways. piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. And STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.







Abstract
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent therapeutic target for innate immunity. Despite the efforts to develop pocket&#8208;dependent small&#8208;molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING&#8208;based vaccine combination with aPD&#8208;1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.

         <title>Unraveling the Unique Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Titanium Dioxide Supported Platinum Clusters for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieve the first construction of strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) between Pt sub&#8208;nanometer clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets. Unique SMSI behaviors &#8211; ordering process of Pt atoms within clusters and superior stability in oxygen at high temperatures &#8211; are unraveled. Further investigation suggests that the disappeared CO adsorption ability originates from the unique electronic interaction after forming SMSI.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial to modulating the nature of metal species, yet the SMSI behaviors of sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters remain unknown due to the difficulties in constructing SMSI at cluster scale. Herein, we achieve the successful construction of the SMSI between Pt clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets by vacuum annealing, which requires a relatively low temperature that avoids the aggregation of small clusters. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy observation is employed to explore the SMSI behaviors, and the results reveal the dynamic rearrangement of Pt atoms upon annealing for the first time. The originally disordered Pt atoms become ordered as the crystallizing of the amorphous TiO2 support, forming an epitaxial interface between Pt and TiO2. Such a SMSI state can remain stable in oxidation environment even at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further investigations prove that the electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt occupies the Pt 5d orbitals, which is responsible for the disappeared CO adsorption ability of Pt/TiO2 after forming SMSI. This work not only opens a new avenue for constructing SMSI at cluster scale but also provides in&#8208;depth understanding on the unique SMSI behavior, which would stimulate the development of supported metal clusters for catalysis applications.

         <title>Suppressed Dissolution of Fluorine&#8208;Rich SEI Enables Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode for Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;rich SEI dissolution is a major cause of zinc anode failure. The SEI content fluctuates significantly during the plating/stripping process, resulting in an unstable electrode/electrolyte interface. A versatile functional electrolyte additive, thioether&#8208;TX was introduced to reduce solvent polarity, as a poor solvent molecule for F&#8722;. Additionally, TX could modulate the Zn2+ solvation structure and adsorb at the electrode/electrolyte interface to reduce the activity of local water, further suppressing the dissolution of ZnF2 and stabilizing the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer.







Abstract
The instability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is a critical challenge for the zinc metal anodes, leading to an erratic electrode/electrolyte interface and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ultimately resulting in anode failure. This study uncovers that the fluorine species dissolution is the root cause of SEI instability. To effectively suppress the F&#8722; dissolution, an introduction of a low&#8208;polarity molecule, 1,4&#8208;thioxane (TX), is proposed, which reinforces the stability of the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Moreover, the TX molecule has a strong affinity for coordinating with Zn2+ and adsorbing at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby diminishing the activity of local water and consequently impeding SEI dissolution. The robust fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer promotes the high durability of the zinc anode in repeated plating/stripping cycles, while concurrently suppressing HER and enhancing Coulombic efficiency. Notably, the symmetric cell with TX demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, sustaining over 500&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Zn||KVOH full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention, averaging 6.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 98&#8201;% retention after 400&#8197;cycles, even at high loading with a lean electrolyte. This work offers a novel perspective on SEI dissolution as a key factor in anode failure, providing valuable insights for the electrolyte design in energy storage devices.

Notably, the symmetric cell with TX demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, sustaining over 500&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the Zn||KVOH full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention, averaging 6.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 98&#8201;% retention after 400&#8197;cycles, even at high loading with a lean electrolyte. This work offers a novel perspective on SEI dissolution as a key factor in anode failure, providing valuable insights for the electrolyte design in energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of the Spatial Effect in a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Reverses the Regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation in Aliphatic Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
This study addressed the challenge of regioselectivity for remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation. A Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase (BlAH) was mined with a promiscuous hydroxylation for aliphatic amino acids. The regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation could be regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. As a proof of concept, the spatial effect of BlAH was redesigned and reversed the regioselectivity from the &#947; to the &#948; site.







Abstract
The hydroxylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aliphatic amino acids yields crucial precursors for the synthesis of high&#8208;value compounds. However, accurate regulation of the regioselectivity of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds hydroxylation in aliphatic amino acids continues to be a common challenge in chemosynthesis and biosynthesis. In this study, the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BlAH) was mined and found to catalyze hydroxylation at the &#947; and &#948; sites of aliphatic amino acids. Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed that regioselectivity was regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. Based on these results, the spatial effect of BlAH was reconstructed to stabilize the transition state at the &#948; site of aliphatic amino acids, thereby successfully reversing the &#947; site regioselectivity to the &#948; site. For example, the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Homoleucine (5&#8201;a) was reversed from the &#947; site (1&#8201;:&#8201;12) to the &#948; site (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The present study not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts for the regioselective functionalization of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the precision&#8208;driven modification of similarly remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in complex molecules.

         <title>Concomitant Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermy and Photoluminescence of Rod&#8208;Shaped Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 Synthesized Concurrently</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two rod&#8208;shaped Au52(PET)32&#8208;G and Au66(PET)38 are synthesized and precisely characterized. Basing on the unreported transverse growth mode from Au52(PET)32&#8208;G to Au66(PET)38, six novel nanoclusters are predicted. Although the two nanoclusters have different aspect ratios and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light collection abilities, they have concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under NIR irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters exhibiting concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation are rarely reported, and some fundamental issues remain unresolved for such materials. Herein, we concurrently synthesized two novel rod&#8208;shaped Au nanoclusters, Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate), and precisely revealed that their kernels were 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 and 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structures, respectively, based on the numbers of Au layers in the [100], [010], and [001] directions. Following the structural growth mode from Au52(PET)32 to Au66(PET)38, we predicted six more novel nanoclusters. The concurrent synthesis provides rational comparison of the two nanoclusters on the stability, absorption, emission and photothermy, and reveals the aspect ratio&#8208;related properties. An interesting finding is that the two nanoclusters exhibit concomitant PT and PL under 785&#8197;nm light irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance, which was explained by the qualitative evaluation of the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates. The ligand effects on PT and PL were also investigated.

         <title>Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) leads to giant nonlinear absorption coefficients and substantial modulation depth. These performance improvements are correlated with the specific alignment of metal d bands and ligand p band in the Mott&#8208;Hubbard compound, and a larger p&#8208;d transition probability to d&#8208;d transition probability associated with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion.







Abstract
Nonlinear absorption coefficient and modulation depth stand as pivotal properties of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, while the existing NLO materials exhibit limitations such as low nonlinear absorption coefficients and/or small modulation depths, thereby severely impeding their practical application. Here we unveil that introducing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion in a Mott&#8208;Hubbard system, (MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) affords the simultaneous attainment of a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth. The optimized compound, (MA)2CuCl4, demonstrates a nonlinear absorption coefficient of (1.5&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, a modulation depth of 60&#8201;%, and a relatively low optical limiting threshold of 1.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These outstanding attributes surpass those of most reported NLO materials. Our investigation reveals that a more pronounced distortion of the [CuX6]4&#8722; octahedron emerges as a crucial factor in augmenting optical nonlinearity. Mechanism study involving structural and spectral characterization along with theoretical calculations indicates a correlation between the compelling performance and the Mott&#8208;Hubbard band structure of the materials, coupled with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion&#8208;induced d&#8208;d transition. This study not only introduces a promising category of high&#8208;performance NLO materials but also provides novel insights into enhancing the performance of such materials.

         <title>Controlling Tin Halide Perovskite Oxidation Dynamics in Solution for Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based perovskites hold promise for solar cell and LED applications, but suffer from inherent oxidation issues with the ubiquitous DMSO solvent. NMR spectroscopy reveals SnI2 oxidation kinetics, suggesting water involvement and HI generation. Processing at 60&#8201;&#176;C suppresses the Sn oxidation, improving film quality and PeLEDs. This low&#8208;temperature protocol promises oxidation&#8208;free Sn perovskites, shaping future device fabrication.







Abstract
As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin&#8208;based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn&#8208;based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI2, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low&#8208;temperature Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low&#8208;temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO&#8208;free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn&#8208;containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin-based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn-based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low-temperature Sn-based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low-temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO-free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation-free Sn-based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn-containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amorphous FeSnOx Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous 2D nanosheets with abundant nano&#8208;sized perforations and oxygen vancancies, mixed with a small amount of monolayer MXene, are coated on PP separators. This simultaneously regulates uniform Na deposition, facilitates the kinetics of polysulfides conversion, and enhances the mechanical properties.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, noted for their low material costs and high energy density, are emerging as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in various applications including power grids and standalone renewable energy systems. These batteries are commonly assembled with glass fiber membranes, which face significant challenges like the dissolution of polysulfides, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and the growth of Na dendrites. Here, we develop an amorphous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) iron tin oxide (A&#8208;FeSnOx) nanosheet with hierarchical vacancies, including abundant oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for RT Na&#8722;S batteries. The Ovs offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the defect concentration is finely tuned to elucidate the polysulfides conversion mechanisms. The nano&#8208;sized perforations aid in regulating Na ions transport, resulting in uniform Na deposition. Moreover, the strategic addition of trace amounts of Ti3C2 (MXene) forms an amorphous/crystalline (A/C) interface that significantly improves the mechanical properties of the separator and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, the task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light (~0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;thin (~200&#8197;nm), and ultra&#8208;robust (modulus=4.9&#8197;GPa) characteristics. Consequently, the RT Na&#8722;S battery maintained a high capacity of 610.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Triphenylamine[3]arenes: Streamlining Synthesis of a Versatile Macrocyclic Platform for Supramolecular Architectures and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of triphenylamine[3]arenes using triphenylamine derivatized monomers via a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with paraformaldehyde is presented. These three&#8208;fold symmetric macrocycles, featuring alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, exhibit versatile properties in luminescence and iodine adsorption, and serve as building blocks for extended frameworks and molecular cages.







Abstract
Triphenylamine[3]arenes (TPA[3]s), featuring [16]paracyclophane backbone with alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, were synthesized through a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction using triphenylamine derivatized monomers and paraformaldehyde. This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron&#8208;donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three&#8208;fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent and Covalent Binding of New Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;like Polyoxidovanadate Clusters to Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In NaCl solutions and in the presence of lysozyme, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange, partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates with composition [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which bind covalently and non&#8208;covalently to the protein surface.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] from crystals grown in 1.1&#8197;M NaCl, 0.1&#8197;M sodium acetate at pH&#8197;4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which non&#8208;covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722; (this latter based on an unusual {V18O43} cage) which covalently bind the protein. EPR spectroscopy confirms the partial oxidation of VIV to VV and the formation of mixed&#8208;valence species. The results indicate that the interaction with proteins can stabilize the structure of unexpected &#8211; both for dimension and architecture &#8211; POVs, not observed in aqueous solution.

         <title>Inside Cover: Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low selectivity is a key scientific challenge that hinders the commercialization of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In their Research Article (&lt;url href=&#8220;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407287&#8221;&gt;e202407287), Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu et&#8197;al. found that the CH4 selectivity of p&#8208;block Bi element exhibits a &#8220;volcanic&#8221; structure&#8208;function relationship when gradually decreasing the p&#8208;band center. This CH4 selectivity of Bi element is also positively correlated with the adsorption energy of key intermediate *CHO and the photoexcited carriers separation efficiency.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;free, dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized and used as a hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cells, as reported by Il&#8197;Seok Chae, Jong&#8197;Hak Kim et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202406796). The unique structure of the polymer chains led to the alignment of phase&#8208;separated domains and continuous proton channels were constructed throughout the membrane. This enabled efficient proton transport and ensured stable performance. A novel design of polymer structure demonstrates a promising prospect for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Cover Picture: Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: an ab initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In mixed&#8208;valent systems, an anti&#8208;symmetric motion leads to electron localisation on or electron transfer between the redox centers. In their Research Article (e202404727), Adam &#352;rut, Benjamin&#8197;J. Lear, Vera Krewald show that additionally, a symmetric motion is present in bridged systems: it is responsible for the characteristic shape of the inter&#8208;valence charge transfer band. The close relationship between the two motions is represented by one surface being the shadow of the other.

         <dc:description>
Built&#8208;in protection: A 1&#8208;step synthesis of supported metal phosphides from cheap precursors is described in the Research Article by Constanze&#8197;N. Neumann (e202404292). The approach delivers Ni2P/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 containing surface ligands that protect the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst from air oxidation. Facile displacement of the surface&#8208;bound phenyl phosphates by substrate molecules gives rise to catalytic activity on par with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst.

An all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskite featuring a considerable piezochromic range of 232 nm is reported by Guanjun Xiao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406015). The cover picture describes an intriguing pressure&#8208;induced piezochromic behavior in typical Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals by using diamond anvil cell. The emission energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85&#8197;eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83&#8197;eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range, thus providing a promising naked&#8208;eye visual pressure monitoring and sensing &#8220;chameleon&#8221;.

         <title>Halogen, Chalcogen, Pnictogen, and Tetrel Bonding in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis: An Update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments on the use of non&#8208;transient non&#8208;covalent interactions based on elements of groups 14&#8211;17 in organic synthesis and organocatalysis are discussed. While halogen and chalcogen bonding are now clearly established in this area, applications of pnictogen and particularly tetrel bonding are only starting to emerge.







Abstract
The use of noncovalent interactions based on electrophilic halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, or tetrel centers in organocatalysis has gained noticeable attention. Herein, we provide an overview on the most important developments in the last years with a clear focus on experimental studies and on catalysts which act via such non&#8208;transient interactions.

         <title>Accelerated Screening of Alternative DNA Base&#8208;Organic Molecule&#8208;Base Architectures via Integrated Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collaborative protocol of fast theoretical simulation and convenient experimental validation was developed for large&#8208;scale screening of alternative DNA base&#8208;organic molecule&#8208;base architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, thereby expanding molecule&#8208;mediated non&#8208;classical DNA self&#8208;assembly structures.







Abstract
Organic molecule&#8208;mediated noncanonical DNA self&#8208;assembly expands the standard DNA base&#8208;pairing alphabets. However, only a very limited number of small molecules have been recognized as mediators because of the tedious and complicated experiments like crystallization and microscopy imaging. Here we present an integrative screening protocol incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) for fast theoretical simulation and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for convenient experimental validation. Melamine, the molecule that was confirmed mediating noncanonical DNA base&#8208;pairing, and 38 other candidate molecules were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol. We successfully identified seven stable noncanonical DNA duplex structures, and another eight novel structures with sub&#8208;stability. In addition, we discovered that hairpins at both ends can significantly stabilize the noncanonical DNA structures, providing a guideline to design small organic molecule&#8208;incorporated DNA structures. Such an efficient screening protocol will accelerate the design of alternative DNA&#8208;molecule architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. Considering the wide range of potential mediators, it will also facilitate applications such as noncovalent, highly dense loading of drug molecules in DNA&#8208;based delivery system and probe design for sensitive detection of certain molecules.

         <title>Chloride&#8208; and Hydrosulfide&#8208;Bound 2Fe Complexes as Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Stable State of [FeFe] Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the oxygen&#8208;stable state of the H&#8208;cluster are revealed. Terminal Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context, demonstrate a striking structural resemblance to the enzymatic Hinact state. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, and labile and kinetically controlled binding of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group.







Abstract
[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of these enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron center bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to the advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and the integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.
