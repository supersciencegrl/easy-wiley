         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non&#8208;reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one&#8208;dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrolyte Design for Rechargeable Batteries: From Lithium to Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and natural abundance of the key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. Here, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is comparatively discussed with that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting ones, and a comprehensive review on the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are provided, aiming at access the status&#8208;quo in the field of RMBs. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improving the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency&#160;CO2/N2 Separation Enabled by Rotation of Electrostatically Anchored Flexible Ligands in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are of great potential for molecular separation, but the ligand rotation flexibility makes them remain challenging in the construction of fixed nanochannels for precise sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208; anchoring strategy to fix the rotation of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM) ligand in ZIF&#8208;8. Electrostatic inducer trifluoroacetate anchored at and blocked the six&#8208;membered windows of ZIF&#8208;8, and meanwhile induced the positive 2&#8208;MIM rotated from initial 49&#176; to 68&#176;, thus opening neighbored four&#8208;membered windows with a constant size of 3.4 &#197;. The obtained ZIF&#8208;8 significantly enhanced the CO  2  /N  2  adsorption selectivity from 14.02 to 332.86. Further membrane&#8208;based separation exhibited an outstanding CO  2  /N  2  selectivity of up to 137 with a desired permeability of 286 Barrer, which exceeded the 2019 upper bound. This strategy provides a new inspiration for fixing the ligand rotation in soft MOF for desired precise molecular sieving.</dc:description>

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8208;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH  4  and N  2  , but captures other competing gases (  e.g.  C  2  H  6  , C  3  H  8  , and CO  2  ) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C  2  H  6  /CH  4  , C  3  H  8  /CH  4  , CO  2  /N  2  , and CO  2  /CH  4  . Particularly, the separation time is ~11 min g  &#8211;1  for the C  2  H  6  /CH  4  (15/85 v/v) mixture and ~49 min g  &#8211;1  for the C  3  H  8  /CH  4  (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0 mL min  &#8211;1  ), respectively, enabling its capability for CH  4  purification from light alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of&#160;Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe Hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co Layered Double Hydroxide Yolk&#8208;shelled Microrods for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of earth&#8208;abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self&#8208;engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk&#8208;shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal&#8208;organic framework, Co&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) yolk&#8208;shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF67 building blocks are transformed into Ni&#8208;Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co LDH yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) through an ion&#8208;exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7 mV dec&#8208;1, and good stability in alkaline media.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Ligand Controlled Structural Evolution of Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Electrochemical Activation during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC&#8208;1 and PC&#8208;2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8208;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor &#8208;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC&#8208;2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC&#8208;2 into active catalyst Fe&#8208;Co(OH)2&#8208;Co(O)OH (AC&#8208;2) has been attained only in 15 CV cycles while 600 CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC&#8208;1 into AC&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8208;O and Fe&#8208;O bond in AC&#8208;2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC&#8208;1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC&#8208;2 and assists in the O&#8208;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Metal Adatoms in a Surface&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrogenation Reaction on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenation reactions are key steps in many metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical processes and in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of atomically precise nanomaterials. The principal role of the metal substrate in these reactions is undisputed, but the role of metal adatoms remains, to a large extent, unanswered, particularly on gold substrates. Here, we discuss their importance by studying the surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation on Au(111) as an ideal model case. We choose a polymer theoretically predicted to give one of two cyclization products depending on the presence or absence of gold adatoms. Scanning probe microscopy experiments observe only the product associated with adatoms. We challenge the prevalent understanding of surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation, unveiling the catalytic role of adatoms and their effect on regioselectivity. The study adds new perspectives to the understanding of metal catalysis and the design of on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols for novel carbon nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Depletion of Tumorigenic Energy Sources Driven by Cascade Reactions for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalytic system based on the co&#8208;delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx), and catalase (CAT) using a fluorinated polymer was developed for efficient antitumor starvation therapy through simultaneous glucose/lactate depletion under continuous O2 supply and guided by photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Glucose and lactate play important roles for tumor growth. How to simultaneously deprive tumors of glucose and lactate is a big challenge. We have developed a cascade catalytic system (denoted as FPGLC) based on fluorinated polymer (FP) with co&#8208;loading of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx), and catalase (CAT). GOx and LOx deprive glucose and lactate, respectively, resulting in abundant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Meanwhile, CAT catalyzes H2O2 into O2, which not only promotes catalytic reactions of GOx and LOx for consuming more glucose and lactate, but also alleviates tumor hypoxia. Benefiting from the excellent cross&#8208;membrane and transmucosal penetration capacities of FP, FPGLC rapidly accumulated in tumors and subsequently mediated enhanced cascade catalytic therapy under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. These results demonstrate that the dual depletion of glucose and lactate with O2 supply is a promising strategy for efficient antitumor starvation therapy.

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluoroallyl Sulfonium Salts: Practical and Bench&#8208;Stable Reagents for Highly Regioselective gem&#8208;Difluoroallylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of bench&#8208;stable yet highly reactive fluoroalkylating reagents, 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salts (DFASs), has been developed. The reaction of DFASs with aromatic and aliphatic zinc reagents via copper catalysis provides general and practical access to a wide range of versatile gem&#8208;difluoroallylated compounds with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules has important applications in producing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the general and efficient methods that can construct both C(sp2)&#8722;CF2R and C(sp3)&#8722;CF2R bonds remain challenging. Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench&#8208;stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Modulated Release of a Cytotoxic Photosensitizer Using Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cytotoxic photosensitizer encapsulated within a redox&#8208;sensitive biocompatible nanogel (IrNG) exhibited good biocompatibility and stability in the dark. It showed cancer&#8208;selective cytotoxicity upon photoirradiation through the dual&#8208;modulated hyperoxidation of disulfide bonds by intracellular glutathione (GSH) and photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS).







Abstract
Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hard to distinguish from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Reforming of Polyol&#8208;based Biomass into CO and H2 over Nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reforming of biopolyols to produce CO and H2 at room temperature in aqueous solution is achieved via a photoelectrochemical system by using nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 photoanode and platinum cathode. Nitrogen doping induces asymmetric distribution of charge of WO3 and thus builts an internal electric field, which effectively improves the photocarrier separation.







Abstract
CO and H2 evolution from renewable and abundant biomass represent a sustainable way, but is challenged to be produced under mild conditions. Herein, we propose to produce CO and H2 from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N&#8208;WO3) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H+, and platinum cathode reduces H+ to H2, achieving CO evolution rate of 45&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (&gt;75&#8201;% gas selectivity) and H2 evolution rate of 237&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with purity &gt;99.99&#8201;% from glycerol. The nitrogen doping induces structure polarity of WO3 photoanode, leading to the formation of an internal electric field which promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charges and improves PEC efficiency. A wide range of biopolyols, such as ethylene glycol, xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and inulin were effectively converted into CO and H2. This work provides a promising method to produce highly pure H2 together with CO from biomass.

&lt;p&gt;Reforming of biopolyols to produce CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature in aqueous solution is achieved via a photoelectrochemical system by using nitrogen-doped WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode and platinum cathode. Nitrogen doping induces asymmetric distribution of charge of WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and thus builts an internal electric field, which effectively improves the photocarrier separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution from renewable and abundant biomass represent a sustainable way, but is challenged to be produced under mild conditions. Herein, we propose to produce CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and platinum cathode reduces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving CO evolution rate of 45&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&amp;gt;75&#8201;% gas selectivity) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 237&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with purity &amp;gt;99.99&#8201;% from glycerol.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrochromic Soft Photonic Crystals Based on MXene&#8208;Integrated Blue Phase Liquid Crystals for Bioinspired Visible and Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired visible and infrared camouflage materials are judiciously designed and fabricated by the controlled in situ growth of novel electrochromic soft photonic crystals onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films exhibiting low mid&#8208;infrared emissivity. This work is expected to shine new light into the development of intelligent nanostructured materials for advanced adaptive camouflage and thermal radiation management&#8208;related technologies.







Abstract
Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by the controlled in situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene&#8208;integrated 3D soft photonic crystals exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel&#8208;controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free&#8208;standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid&#8208;IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.

The inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers was investigated. Bridged bicyclic lactones were obtained diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively and converted into synthetically relevant polysubstituted enantioenriched cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene derivatives. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards a stepwise mechanism.







Abstract
A broadly applicable diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers is reported herein. Using a copper(II)&#8208;BOX catalytic system, bridged bicyclic lactones are obtained in very high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers. Mechanistic experiments as well as DFT calculations indicate the occurrence of a stepwise mechanism. The synthetic potential of the bridged bicyclic lactones is showcased by the enantioselective synthesis of polyfunctional cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes, as well as a carbasugar unit.

         <title>Making Polyisoprene Self&#8208;Healable through Microstructure Regulation by Rare&#8208;Earth Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>

Polyisoprenes with an appropriate mixture of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures were synthesized by scandium catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of isoprene. The polyisoprenes exhibited excellent elasticity and self&#8208;healability without any external intervention, which is a result of microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a highly flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix at the nanoscale.







Abstract
The creation of self&#8208;healing polymers from commodity olefins is of great interest and importance but has remained a challenge to date. We report here for the first time the synthesis of self&#8208;healing polymers by catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of a simple commodity diene, isoprene. We found that polyisoprenes having an appropriate mixture (ca. 70/30) of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures synthesized by using a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst could act as excellent self&#8208;healing elastomers without any external intervention. The unprecedented self&#8208;healability could be ascribed to nanoscale heterogeneities formed by microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix. The hydrogenated polyisoprenes (without C=C bonds) with the analogous microstructures also exhibited excellent mechanical and self&#8208;healing properties, further demonstrating that even simple polyolefins can be made self&#8208;healable if the microstructures are appropriately regulated.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Nonpolar Pore Surfaces for the One&#8208;Step Acquisition of C2H4 from a C2H4 and C2H6 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;organic framework FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) which has nonpolar pore surfaces can directly give polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at different gas flow rates, temperatures, and relative humidity. This separation is possible because it adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K.







Abstract
Because C2H4 plays an essential role in the chemical industry, economical and energy&#8208;efficient separation of ethylene (C2H4) from ethane (C2H6) is extremely important. With the exception of energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation, there are few one&#8208;step methods to obtain polymer&#8208;grade (&#8805;99.95&#8201;% pure) C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. Here we report a highly stable metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) (FJI&#8208;H=Hong's group in Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter) which features one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal nonpolar pore surfaces constructed by aromatic rings and alkyl groups. This FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K. Practical breakthrough experiments with C2H4 containing 1&#8201;% C2H6 have shown that FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) can realize the acquisition in one&#8208;step of polymer&#8208;grade, 99.95&#8201;% pure C2H4 under various conditions including different gas flow rates, temperatures and relative humidity.

Here we report a highly stable metal-organic-framework (MOF) FJI-H11-Me(des) (FJI-H=Hong's group in Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter) which features one-dimensional hexagonal nonpolar pore surfaces constructed by aromatic rings and alkyl groups. This FJI-H11-Me(des) adsorbs C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; rather than C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; between 273 and 303&#8197;K. Practical breakthrough experiments with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; containing 1&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; have shown that FJI-H11-Me(des) can realize the acquisition in one-step of polymer-grade, 99.95&#8201;% pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under various conditions including different gas flow rates, temperatures and relative humidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Passivation for Lead&#8208;Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) was proposed. The ACAC treatment can enlarge the grain size, and the EDA treatment stabilizes the perovskite against oxidation. A 13.0&#8201;% efficiency with improved stability was reported, which is one of the top efficiencies and stabilities for tin halide perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead&#8208;based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by the fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) enhancement). A promising 13&#8201;% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or amines are selected, with similar effects. This study provides a universal strategy to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects while fabricating stable PKSCs with high efficiency.

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)/phosphine catalysis system enabled versatile meta&#8208;arene C&#8722;H glycosylation by &#963;&#8208;activation. Thus, easily accessible glycosyl bromide donors furnished 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;aryl glycosides via robust ruthenium(II) catalysis under exceedingly mild conditions.







Abstract
The prevalence of C&#8208;aryl glycosides in biologically active natural products and approved drugs has long motivated the development of efficient strategies for their selective synthesis. Cross&#8208;couplings have been frequently used, but largely relied on palladium catalyst with prefunctionalized substrates, while ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;aryl glycoside preparation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we disclose a versatile ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation to access meta&#8208;C&#8208;aryl glycosides from readily available glycosyl halide donors. The robustness of the ruthenium catalysis was reflected by mild reaction conditions, outstanding levels of anomeric selectivity and exclusive meta&#8208;site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Electrode Potential of a Working Anode in Dictating the Structural Evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of a working anode, in dictating the structural evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was investigated theoretically and experimentally, which provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.







Abstract
The performance of rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries is highly correlated with the structure of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The properties of a working anode are vital factors in determining the structure of SEI; however, the correspondingly poor understanding hinders the rational regulation of SEI. Herein, the electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of an anode, in dictating the structural evolution of SEI were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The anode potential is identified as a crucial role in dictating the SEI structure. The anode potential determines the reduction products in the electrolyte, ultimately giving rise to the mosaic and bilayer SEI structure at high and low potential, respectively. In contrast, the anode material does not cause a significant change in the SEI structure. This work discloses the crucial role of electrode potential in dictating SEI structure and provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.

         <title>An Organo&#8208;Palladium Host Built from a Dynamic Macrocyclic Ligand: Adaptive Self&#8208;Assembly, Induced&#8208;Fit Guest Binding, and Catalysis</title>

Induced&#8208;fit self&#8208;assembly using a pyridinium&#8208;based dynamic macrocyclic ligand gives rise to a new water&#8208;soluble adaptive organo&#8208;palladium host. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both an electron&#8208;rich W10O324&#8722; cluster and toluene derivatives within the redox&#8208;active host facilitates efficient and selective C&#8722;H photooxidation under mild conditions.







Abstract
Artificial hosts with rich conformational dynamics are attractive to supramolecular chemists due to their adaptive guest&#8208;binding properties and enzyme&#8208;like catalytic functions. We report here the adaptive self&#8208;assembly and host&#8208;guest catalysis of a new water&#8208;soluble organo&#8208;palladium host (Pd2L2) built from a pyridinium&#8208;bonded macrocyclic ligand (L) and cis&#8208;blocked palladium corners (Pd). While the direct self&#8208;assembly of L with Pd gives rise to a dynamic mixture of products, both neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbons and an anionic polyoxometalate cluster (W10O324&#8722;) can template the dominant formation of the Pd2L2 host. Guest&#8208;adaptive conformational changes and induced&#8208;fit cavity deformation of the Pd2L2 host have been clearly observed in the crystal structures. Moreover, the installation of the electron&#8208;rich W10O324&#8722; cluster within the cationic redox&#8208;active host (W10O32&#8834;Pd2L2) facilitates the efficient and selective C&#8722;H photooxidation of toluene derivatives to aldehyde products under mild conditions, thus representing an ideal platform for green supramolecular catalysis.

         <title>Selectively Coupling Ru Single Atoms to PtNi Concavities for High&#8208;Performance Methanol Oxidation via d&#8208;Band Center Regulation</title>

Single atom&#8208;cavity coupling enables the superior activity and stability of Ru single atoms tailored PtNi nano&#8208;catalysts towards methanol oxidation, synthesized by the selective ALD. The modulated d&#8208;band center and higher diffusion barrier accounts for the unparalleled activity and stability on the Ru single atoms coupled to PtNi cavities, respectively.







Abstract
Single atom tailored metal nanoparticles represent a new type of catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a single atom&#8208;cavity coupling strategy to regulate performance of single atom tailored nano&#8208;catalysts. Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) was conducted to deposit Ru single atoms on the surface concavities of PtNi nanoparticles (Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi). Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi exhibits a record&#8208;high activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with 2.01&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt. Also, Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi showcases a significant durability with only 16&#8201;% activity loss. Operando electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations demonstrate Ru single atoms coupled to cavities accelerate the CO removal by regulating d&#8208;band center position. Further, the high diffusion barrier of Ru single atoms in concavities accounts for excellent stability. The developed Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi via single atom&#8208;cavity coupling opens an encouraging pathway to design highly efficient single atom&#8208;based (electro)catalysts.

         <title>Flexible Single&#8208;Chain&#8208;Heteropolymer&#8208;Derived Transmembrane Ion Channels with High K+ Selectivity and Tunable pH&#8208;Gated Characteristics</title>

A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymer (RHP)&#8208;based artificial transmembrane ion channels were prepared via facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization. K+ could be preferably recognized and transported through the nanopores formed by the aligned crown ethers on RHPs. Through simple modification, the RHP&#8208;derived potassium channels manifested satisfactory membrane compatibility, high K+ selectivity, and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors.







Abstract
A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymer (RHP)&#8208;derived artificial ion channels with both high K+ selectivity and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors were fabricated by a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization method. The benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moieties appended on lateral chains of RHPs can form ion&#8208;permeable nanopores and transport K+ over Na+ through the lipid bilayers. The ion permeation selectivity was significantly enhanced by incorporating a cholesterol group to serve as a membrane anchor. Interestingly, similar to natural gated protein channels, on&#8211;off switchable characteristics were also realized by integrating an additional acid&#8208;sensitive alkylamine group into the RHP&#8208;derived channel. The unique design strategies have endowed the RHP&#8208;derived ion channels with facile synthetic procedures, desirable membrane compatibility, high K+ selectivity, and tunable pH&#8208;gated properties. This work provides an entry point for future design of novel functional nanochannels.

         <title>Surface Boron Modulation on Cobalt Oxide Nanocrystals for Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of Co&#8722;B oxides with tunable morphology and textural parameters are synthesized via a facile precipitation and post calcination method. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ pair distribution function support formation of amorphous B2O3 and crystalline Co3O4 within the composite material. The synergy between boron and cobalt enhances significantly OER performance of the electrocatalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we show that coupling boron with cobalt oxide tunes its structure and significantly boost its electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through a simple precipitation and thermal treatment process, a series of Co&#8722;B oxides with tunable morphologies and textural parameters were prepared. Detailed structural analysis supported first the formation of an disordered and partially amorphous material with nanosized Co3BO5 and/or Co2B2O6 being present on the local atomic scale. The boron modulation resulted in a superior OER reactivity by delivering a large current and an overpotential of 338&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Identical location transmission electron microscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy studies revealed alteration and surface re&#8208;construction of materials, and formation of CoO2 and (oxy)hydroxide intermediate, which were found to be highly dependent on crystallinity of the samples.

         <title>Efficient Photoreduction of Diluted CO2 to Tunable Syngas by Ni&#8722;Co Dual Sites through d&#8208;band Center Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding strength of *CO and *H can be collectively regulated through d&#8208;band center manipulation over Ni&#8722;Co dual sites, enabling the kinetic controls of both the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution processes. The as&#8208;obtained Ni doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets exhibit superior activity and controllable selectivity in the photoconversion of diluted CO2 to syngas under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising way to address the energy and environmental challenges. Here we report the integration of Ni&#8722;Co dual sites on Ni doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets assembled double&#8208;hollow nanotube (Ni&#8722;Co3O4 NSDHN) for efficient photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. Quasi in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the declining of d&#8208;band center of Ni&#8722;Co dual sites enables the electrons accumulation in the dxz/dyz&#8208;2&#960;* and dz2&#8208;5&#963; orbitals. As a result, the binding strength of *CO is weakened and the *H adsorption site is modulated from metal sites to an oxygen site. Remarkably, Ni&#8722;Co3O4 NSDHN exhibits superior diluted CO2 photoconversion activity and controllable selectivity under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight. A syngas evolution rate of 170.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.7&#8201;% and continuously adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 to 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 are achieved.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Aluminum Coordination Environments in Mordenite Zeolite and Their Role in the Dimethyl Ether (DME) Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the protonic zeolite mordenite adsorbs pyridine, the nonframework aluminum species, preferentially located in the side pockets, can be forced back into the zeolite framework.

Part of tetrahedral framework aluminum in a protonic mordenite (HMOR) will convert geometry to distorted tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. High&#8208;field 27Al&#8197;NMR data show that more framework Al atoms at T3 and T4 sites change geometry to nonframework structures than others. These nonframework Al species preferentially reside in the side pockets, which will decrease the accessibility of acid sites in the 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) channel, impairing the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction. The arisen octahedrally coordinated Al species are framework&#8208;associated, which can be reverted into the zeolite framework. Herein, we find that a facile treatment with pyridine could force the octahedral coordination Al back into a tetrahedral environment, which could increase the number of available active sites and enhance the diffusion of DME, thus improving the reactivity (4 times) of the DME carbonylation reaction and prolonging the lifetime of catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;When the protonic zeolite mordenite adsorbs pyridine, the nonframework aluminum species, preferentially located in the side pockets, can be forced back into the zeolite framework. This change increases the number of available active sites and enhances the diffusion of dimethyl ether (DME), hence improving the catalytic performances on the DME carbonylation reaction.

         <title>Oxy&#8208;Borylenes as Photoreductants: Synthesis and Application in Dehalogenation and Detosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a series of oxy&#8208;borylenes and their corresponding radical cations is reported. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for those highly reducing oxy&#8208;borylenes. Their ability as photoreductants is then showcased by the detosylation of tosylated anilines and the dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl as well as alkyl halides under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
While the range of accessible borylenes has significantly broadened over the last decade, applications remain limited. Herein, we present tricoordinate oxy&#8208;borylenes as potent photoreductants that can be readily activated by visible light. Facile oxidation of CAAC stabilized oxy&#8208;borylenes (CAAC)(IPr2Me2)BOR (R=TMS, CH2CH2C6H5, CH2CH2(4&#8208;F)C6H4) to their corresponding radical cations is achieved with mildly oxidizing ferrocenium ion. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for such oxy&#8208;borylenes placing them among the strongest organic super electron donors. Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.

         <title>Fluorination Treatment of Conjugated Protonated Polyanilines for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation can get electrochemical performance improved by introducing functional groups. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PANI&#8208;H+/CNT organic composite cathode via fluoridized treatment provides a capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for PF6&#8722; storage, which may facilitate sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries with long cycle life and stable energy/power outputs.







Abstract
The overall performance of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized&#8208;polyaniline&#8208;H+/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high&#8208;efficiency PF6&#8722; storage. F&#8722; in PF6&#8722; is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8722;NH&#8722; in FPHC, so that PF6&#8722; can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) (310&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1/7720&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Besides, the relative pouch&#8208;type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.

A hole transport material (BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F) is designed, and it can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility, a decreased energy disorder and high scalability. The perovskite solar cells based on BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F without any dopant obtain promising power conversion efficiencies of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%) for small&#8208;area devices (0.062&#8197;cm2) and 20.17&#8201;% for large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2).







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport materials (HTMs) remain highly desirable for stable and efficient n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) but rarely succeed. Here, we propose a molecular assembly strategy to overcome the limited optoelectronic properties of organic HTMs by precisely designing a linear organic small molecule BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F from the atomic to the molecular levels. BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility and decreased energy disorder. The resultant pero&#8208;SCs showed a promising efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%), which is the highest certified value of pero&#8208;SCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs, to date. These devices also showed a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 22.50&#8201;% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 20.17&#8201;% for 15.64&#8208;cm2 module. For the first time, the pero&#8208;SCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs realized ultralong stabilities with T80 lifetimes over 1200&#8197;h under operation or thermal aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

A semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) with a moderate electronic conductivity of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated as the cathode material for aqueous Zn battery. With the synergetic benefits of the semi&#8208;conductive nature and bipolar&#8208;type reaction of PDAN, the Zn//PDAN cell shows a promising capacity and a perfect cycle stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries have received considerable attention owing to their green, low&#8208;cost and high safe nature. Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (&#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and most of reported promising performances of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are achieved with a low mass&#8208;loading (&#8776;2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Herein, we demonstrate a semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar&#8208;type charge storage mechanism. Accordingly, the Zn//PDAN cell exhibits a promising capacity (140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a remarkable cycle stability (1000 cycles without capacity fading) at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These encouraging results shed light on the design of advanced organic electrode.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Rhodium Cooperativity in Photoinduced ortho&#8208;Alkynylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photo&#8208;induced Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;alkynylation is developed under ambient conditions without the requirement of exogenous oxidant, photosensitizer or engineered substrate/catalyst. The transformation functions by the specific cooperative effect of a six&#8208;membered rhodacycle which is the photo&#8208;responsive species. The catalytic system allows the conjugation of arenes with sp3&#8208;rich pharmacophoric fragments.







Abstract
In the realm of metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;H activation strategy, the direct excitation of the transition metal which plays the dual role of light energy harnessing alongside performing the bond breaking and forming is a rare phenomenon. In this context we have developed the first photo&#8208;induced Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;alkynylation under ambient conditions without the requirement of silver salt, photocatalyst (PC) or any engineered substrate or catalyst. The transformation functions by the specific cooperative effect of a six&#8208;membered rhodacycle which is the photo&#8208;responsive species. The catalytic system allows the conjugation of arenes with sp3&#8208;rich pharmacophoric fragments. The control experiments as well as the computational studies resolve the mechanistic intricacies for this transformation. An outer sphere electron transfer process from Rh to alkynyl radical is operative for the present photo&#8208;induced transformation over the more common oxidative addition or 1,2&#8208;migratory insertion pathways.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Anhydrides for the Solvent&#8208;Controlled Switchable Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro Compounds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers selective fragmentation of a C&#8722;Cl bond of chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) generating a gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical intermediate. In the presence of olefin and under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, a notable synthetic divergence is achieved to access a wide array of gem&#8208;difluoro compounds.







Abstract
The incorporation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene (CF2) group into organic frameworks is highly sought due to the influence of this unit on the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of molecules. Herein we report an operationally simple, mild, and switchable protocol to access various gem&#8208;difluoro compounds that employs chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) as a low&#8208;cost and versatile fluoroalkylating reagent. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers mesolytic cleavage of a C&#8722;Cl bond generating a gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical. In the presence of alkene, this radical species acts as a unique intermediate that, under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, delivers a wide range of gem&#8208;difluorinated &#947;&#8208;lactams, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and promotes oxy&#8208;perfluoroalkylation. These protocols are flow&#8208; and batch&#8208;scalable, possess excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecules.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Selenium and Tellurium Compounds using a Thermally Stable Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salt Accessible from SF6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SF5&#8722; salt containing a chemically inert phosphonium ion proved to be a powerful oxidative fluorination reagent for the generation of fluorinated selenium and tellurium anions, derived from the elements or the diphenyl dichalcogenides. The new anions PhSeF4&#8722;, PhTeF4&#8722; and PhTeF4O&#8722; were synthesized and characterized. Alkylation of the latter provides access to trans&#8208;PhTeF4OR, a new class of fluorinated building blocks.







Abstract
Fluorinated group 16 moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but only few synthetic methods are available to prepare them. Herein, we report a new oxidative fluorination reagent capable of stabilizing reactive fluorinated anions. It consists of an SF5&#8722; anion and a chemically inert phosphonium cation and is exceptionally thermally stable. Accordingly, it was used to generate the SeF5&#8722; and TeF5&#8722; anions from the elemental chalcogens and to prepare the unknown tetrafluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;selenate PhSeF4&#8722; and &#8208;tellurate PhTeF4&#8722; from the corresponding diphenyl dichalcogenides. In addition, we show that further derivatization of [PhTeF4]&#8722; by oxidation to trans&#8208;PhTeF4O&#8722; and subsequent alkylation gives access to a new class of trans&#8208;(alkoxy)(phenyl)tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;tellanes (trans&#8208;PhTeF4OR), thus providing an approach to introduce the functional group into organic molecules.

         <title>Atroposelective Electrophilic Sulfenylation of N&#8208;Aryl Aminoquinone Derivatives Catalyzed by Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives catalyzed by a new chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide has been achieved. Axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities.

Abstract
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions. Various axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. A class of relatively flexible stereogenic C&#8722;N axes was easily constructed. The experimental results and a computational study suggested that an intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity and underscored the importance of catalyst rigidity in this sulfenylation reaction.

         <title>Generating High&#8208;valent Iron&#8208;oxo &#8801;FeIV=O Complexes in Neutral Microenvironments through Peroxymonosulfate Activation by Zn&#8722;Fe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>

         <dc:description>
We have constructed a neutral microenvironment on the surface of Zn&#8722;Fe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe&#8208;LDH) by using the amphoteric oxide properties of zinc hydroxide, which overcomes the pH limit and ensures the continuous production of &#8801;FeIV=O and efficient degradation of organic pollutants. It is the first report of LDHs on high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo complexes, providing inspiration for future research.







Abstract
The universal limit on the pH conditions is disturbing peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;triggered high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo systems in environmental applications. Here, we propose for the first time the construction of a neutral microenvironment on the surface of Zn&#8722;Fe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe&#8208;LDH) by using the amphoteric properties of zinc hydroxide, which continuously generates &#8801;FeIV=O over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;11.0 in activating PMS. The &#8801;Zn(OH)2 moiety offers a neutral microenvironment at the phase interface, which mitigates the self&#8208;decomposition of &#8801;FeIV=O by protons and the hydrolysis reaction of iron by hydroxyl groups, which is supported by the Mossbauer spectra, density functional theory calculations and designed experiments. Consequently, ZnFe&#8208;LDH/PMS can satisfy the stability in long&#8208;term experiments, selectivity under conditions with high salinity or natural organic matter and efficient treatment of actual wastewater.

         <title>resPAINT: Accelerating Volumetric Super&#8208;Resolution Localisation Microscopy by Active Control of Probe Emission
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new super&#8208;resolution technique for localisation microscopy, which combines active control of probe photophysics with stochastic binding is reported. resPAINT yields an up to 50&#8208;fold improvement in localisation rate vs. PAINT without compromising contrast and is fully compatible with large depth of field imaging techniques. This opens the door to larger scale 3D localisation microscopy as imaging that normally takes days can now be completed in hours.







Abstract
Points for accumulation in nanoscale topography (PAINT) allows practically unlimited measurements in localisation microscopy but is limited by background fluorescence at high probe concentrations, especially in volumetric imaging. We present reservoir&#8208;PAINT (resPAINT), which combines PAINT and active control of probe photophysics. In resPAINT, an activatable probe &#8220;reservoir&#8221; accumulates on target, enabling a 50&#8208;fold increase in localisation rate versus conventional PAINT, without compromising contrast. By combining resPAINT with large depth&#8208;of&#8208;field microscopy, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of entire cell surfaces. We generalise the approach by implementing various switching strategies and 3D imaging techniques. Finally, we use resPAINT with a Fab to image membrane proteins, extending the operating regime of PAINT to include a wider range of biological interactions.

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Membrane&#8208;Protein Binding Kinetics and Cell&#8211;Surface Adhesion Using Plasmonic Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) is realized on a prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM provides &#8776;7&#8197;times higher spatial resolution and &#8776;70&#8197;times larger field of view than typical SPR microscopy, thus providing more details about cell response to ligand binding on over 100&#8197;cells. PSM also allows mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts.







Abstract
Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is an excellent platform for in situ studying cell&#8208;substrate interactions. However, SPRM suffers from poor spatial resolution and small field of view. Herein, we demonstrate plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) by adding a dry objective on a popular prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM not only retains SPRM's high sensitivity and real&#8208;time analysis capability, but also provides &#8776;7&#8197;times higher spatial resolution and &#8776;70&#8197;times larger field of view than the typical SPRM, thus providing more details about membrane protein response to ligand binding on over 100 cells simultaneously. In addition, PSM allows quantifying the target movements in the axial direction with a high spatial resolution, thus allowing mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts. This work may offer a powerful and cost&#8208;effective strategy for upgrading current SPR products.

By rational electrolyte design to exploit the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation strategy, the low&#8208;temperature charge&#8211;discharge performance of the graphite anode is greatly boosted, which enables the LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2||graphite batteries to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and maintain 58.3&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The rechargeability of contemporary lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is challenging at low temperatures, mainly due to the hurdles faced by graphite anodes. Herein, by exploiting the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite, its low&#8208;temperature rechargeability is boosted. Experimental characterizations aided by theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co&#8208;intercalation process is featured by low interfacial resistance with a small charge transfer activation energy (0.23&#8197;eV&#8201;atom&#8722;1) and an extremely low diffusion energy barrier (0.09&#8197;eV&#8201;atom&#8722;1) which leads to nearly temperature&#8208;independent diffusion coefficients of the solvated Li&#8208;ion in graphite, enabling graphite to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with 73.7&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Consequently, the full&#8208;cell consisting of a LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2 cathode and a graphite anode shows impressive rechargeability under &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides an alternative approach to develop low&#8208;temperature rechargeable LIBs.

This work provides an alternative approach to develop low-temperature rechargeable LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incredibly strong C&#8722;X bonds such as those in aryl fluorides are catalytically cleaved using an anionic Rh&#8722;Ga photoredox catalyst. Excitation of the bimetallic complex with violet light generates a potent photoreductant that is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer to even electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides that ultimately results in substrate hydrodefluorination.







Abstract
An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoromethylarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H2, a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh0 intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H2 and base as the terminal reductant.

         <title>Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, Molecular Recognition and Chirality Sensing of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Naphthotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes have been successfully developed. The three&#8208;membered naphthotubes possess a rigid and well&#8208;defined cavity, while four&#8208;membered naphthotubes possess a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. They show quite strong binding affinities (up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1) to organic cations and can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations.







Abstract
Macrocyclic hosts with a well&#8208;defined cavity are particularly appealing for supramolecular chemistry, but they are still rare. In this research, we reported a new class of macrocyclic hosts, namely methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes, with well&#8208;defined cavities. They were synthesized through TFA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions between alkoxy&#8208;substituted bisnaphthalenes and paraformaldehyde. A configurational selection was observed. Three&#8208;membered macrocycles possess a single cavity, while four&#8208;membered macrocycles adopt a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. The small homologue shows quite strong binding affinities (up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1) to organic cations, which is better than structurally similar but flexible macrocycles. This demonstrates the advantage of a well&#8208;defined cavity in molecular recognition. Moreover, these naphthotubes can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations through different chirality transfer mechanisms.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Accelerated Precursor Crystallisation in Ambient Air for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells toward Mass Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase crystallized mixed&#8208;cation perovskite powder assisted with moisture in ambient air is developed. The significant role of moisture in introducing the solvation effect and the facet orientation change of PbI2 is demonstrated by a combined experimental and theoretical investigation. Perovskite solar cells based on &#945;&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;cation perovskite powder deliver an impressive PCE of 24.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;pure crystallised perovskite is considered an excellent precursor for fabricating high&#8208;stability perovskite films with minimal defects. However, currently available protocols for synthesising crystallised perovskites must be conducted in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of an organic solvent as the reaction medium, which hinders mass production. Here, we report the fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase&#8208;crystallised perovskite powder assisted by moisture in ambient air. Moisture can promote the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts and facilitate complete phase transition, as demonstrated in a joint experimental and theoretical study. Perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 24.07&#8201;% were achieved using phase&#8208;pure crystallised perovskite powder as the precursor. This ambient&#8208;air&#8208;compatible method opens new vistas to reproducible high&#8208;quality precursors for large&#8208;scale photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Zn&#8208;S Batteries in Aqueous Media Through Cosolvent&#8208;Catalyst Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible Zn&#8722;S chemistry in aqueous media is realized by introducing tetraglyme cosolvent and iodine catalyst. The cosolvent&#8208;catalyst synergy can not only activate the polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple for S conversion but also generate an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase on Zn in situ, thus resulting in boosted cathode activity and anode stability. The strategy presents a new paradigm to stabilize aqueous Zn&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery with high energy density represents a promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, but its application is severely hindered by the poor reversibility of both S cathode and Zn anode. Herein, we develop a &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte containing tetraglyme (G4) and water as co&#8208;solvents and I2 as additive. The G4&#8208;I2 synergy could activate efficient polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple and shield the cathode from water, thus facilitating the conversion kinetics of S and suppressing the interfacial side reactions. Simultaneously, it could stabilize Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase upon cycling. With boosted electrodes reversibility, the Zn&#8722;S cell delivers a high capacity of 775&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and retains over 70&#8201;% capacity after 600 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The advances can also be readily generalized to other ethers/water hybrid electrolytes, showing the universality of the &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte design strategy.

A cycloisomerization/asymmetric allylation/spiroketalization cascade reaction of o&#8208;alkynylacetophenones and (1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols enabled by Ir/Ag/acid ternary catalysis was developed, affording structurally diverse bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroketals in high efficiency with mostly high diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
We reported herein an iridium/silver/acid ternary catalytic system to access bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroketals in high efficiency with generally high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). In this procedure, readily available o&#8208;alkynylacetophenones undergo cycloisomerization to generate isochromenes in situ that participate in stereoselective allylation/spiroketalization sequence with 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols. Meanwhile, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also compatible in this cascade reaction, furnishing structurally novel bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroaminals with good diastereoselectivities (8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;12&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (98&#8201;%&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, experimental studies and theoretical calculations were performed to illustrate the reaction mechanism and stereochemistry.

         <title>Integrating Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Two&#8208;Dimensional Elastic&#8208;Bending and Reconfigurable Plastic&#8208;Twisting Deformations into an Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations were successfully implemented and could be controlled independently in an organic crystal. The multiple flexibilities enabled both spatial control of the optical transmission for cryogenic applications and the reusability of light polarization rotations.







Abstract
Integrating plasticity and elasticity in anisotropic molecular crystals is theoretically possible and is beneficial in enabling rich and complex deformations; however, it is much harder to implement in practice. Herein, we report a centimeter&#8208;long organic crystal that is two&#8208;dimensionally (2D) elastically bendable not only at room temperature but also at ultralow temperatures (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C). The straight crystal can also be manually twisted and reconfigured to form arbitrary right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helical structures. The integration of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant (LTR) 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations into one organic crystal expands the perspectives of the emerging crystal flexibility. Taking advantage of the unique multiple flexibility characteristics, spatial controllability of optical transmission for cryogenic applications and reusability of light&#8208;polarization rotations have been implemented simultaneously in an organic crystal.

         <title>Suppressing Electron Back&#8208;Donation for a Highly CO&#8208;tolerant Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst via Cobalt Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Co into MoNi4 nanocatalyst can suppress the d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back donation, leading to excellent CO tolerance. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exceeding that of 209&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst is commercially adopted in fuel cells but it undergoes formidable active&#8208;site poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO). In particular, given the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC), the issues of Pt poisoning and slow rate would combine mutually, notably worsening the device performances. Here we overcome these challenges through incorporating cobalt (Co) into molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy (MoNi4), termed Co&#8208;MoNi4, which not only shows superior HOR activity over the Pt/C catalyst in alkali, but more intriguingly exhibits excellent CO tolerance with only small activity decay after 10&#8201;000 cycles in the presence of 500 parts per million (ppm) CO. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the AEMFC assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, far exceeding the Pt/C catalyst. Experimental and computational studies reveal that weakened CO chemisorption originates from the electron&#8208;deficient Ni sites after Co incorporation that suppresses d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back&#8208;donation.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two selenoviologen (SeV2+)&#8208;appendant metallacycles with tunable optoelectronic properties were synthesized. Selenoviologen radical cations (SeV+.) can be stabilized due to the metallacyclic effect (strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures), which were validated by electrochromism. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra not only confirmed the long&#8208;lived charge separation states of metallacycle, but also demonstrated its vital role in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions with high efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%).







Abstract
Two coordinated metallacycles (rhomboid for M1, hexagonal for M2) with selenoviologens (SeV2+) pendants were synthesized via coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. M1/M2 with rigid and discrete metallacyclic cores showed tunable optoelectronic properties due to strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) revealed that the formation of macrocyclic structure can not only enhance the stability of radical cation, but also improve the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer and produce a long&#8208;lived charge separation state. The electrochromic performances of M1/M2&#8208;based devices were exhibited to show decent radical stabilization. By using M1/M2 as the photocatalyst, the improved catalytic efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%) of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions was achieved due to the highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states, which were also confirmed by fs&#8208;TA.

         <title>Electrochemical Conjugation of Aptamers on a Carbon Fiber Microelectrode Enables Highly Stable and Selective In&#8197;Vivo Neurosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and simple approach to interface aptamers with implantable electrodes for in&#8197;vivo sensing is reported. The strategy employs direct electrochemical conjugation to couple aptamers onto carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes (CFEs) with high controllability, efficiency, and stability. The covalent linkage improves the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, thereby allowing the continuous in&#8197;vivo probing of dopamine (DA) dynamics in the brain.







Abstract
Interfacing aptamers with carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) provides a versatile platform to probe the chemical activity in a living brain at the molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient and simple approach to interface aptamers with implantable electrodes for in&#8197;vivo sensing is reported. The strategy employs direct electrochemical conjugation to couple aptamers onto carbon-fiber electrodes (CFEs) with high controllability, efficiency, and stability. The covalent linkage improves the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, thereby allowing the continuous in&#8197;vivo probing of dopamine (DA) dynamics in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Near Infrared Light Induced Radical Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near infrared irradiation can be sufficient to initiate radical polymerization when absorbed by gold nanorods, exploiting the photothermal effect to transfer energy to a thermal initiator molecule. A water&#8208;soluble monomer is readily polymerized in aqueous environments affording water&#8208;soluble polymers with tuneable molecular weights, including by irradiation through biological tissue.







Abstract
We introduce a gold nanorod (AuNR) driven methodology to induce free radical polymerization in water with near infrared light (800&#8197;nm). The process exploits photothermal conversion in AuNR and subsequent heat transfer to a radical initiator (here azobisisobutyronitrile) for primary radical generation. A broad range of reaction conditions were investigated, demonstrating control over molecular weight and reaction conversion of dimethylacrylamide polymers, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We underpin our experimental data with finite element simulation of the spatio&#8208;temporal temperature profile surrounding the AuNR directly after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. Critically, we evidence that polymerization can be induced through biological tissues given the enhanced penetration depth of the near infrared light. We submit that the presented initiation mechanism in aqueous systems holds promise for radical polymerization in biological environments, including cells.

The otherwise insoluble binary Zintl anions (TrBi3)2&#8722; (Tr=Ga, In, Tl) can be solubilized in THF on treatment with the low&#8208;coordinate manganese complex [Mn(hmds)2] (hmds=N(SiMe3)2), yielding new heterometallic Zintl clusters [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722;, [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (see figure), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722;. The electronic properties of the Bi22&#8722; anion&#8208;containing coordination compounds are disclosed.







Abstract
Lowering the charge of Zintl anions by (element&#8208;)organic substituents allows their use as sources of (semi)metal nanostructures in common organic solvents, as realized for group 15 anions or Ge94&#8722; and Sn94&#8722;.

Work&#8208;up afforded soluble [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722; (in 1), [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (in 2), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722; (in 3) (crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; Tr=Ga, In, Tl; hmds=N(SiMe3)2), representing rare cases of Zintl clusters with open&#8208;shell metal atoms. 1 comprises the first coordination compound of the (TlBi3)2&#8722; anion, 2 features a diamond&#8208;shaped {Pn2M2} unit, and 3 is a mixed&#8208;valent MnI/MnII compound.

         <dc:description>
A highly selective synthesis of six different fused tetracyclic heterocycles from readily available diarylalkynes and isocyanides is disclosed. It has high step economy and good functional tolerance. An unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes occurs enabled by a sequential double isocyanide insertion.







Abstract
Herein, we present a direct and efficient synthesis of diverse polysubstituted fused tetracyclic heterocycles with good functional group tolerance from diarylalkynes under different palladium catalytic systems. In this chemistry, an unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes through the highly selective sequential double insertion of isocyanide was achieved for the first time. The practicality of this method was further demonstrated by the construction of various bioactive molecules and important structural motifs, with potential applications in materials science and biochemistry. In addition, density functional theory calculations (DFT) elucidated an interesting &#8220;Pd walk&#8221; during the cyclization process.

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy was proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY). In this way, Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY are periodically interrupted to reformat and strengthen the delocalized electronic states, ultimately yielding excellent electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing decoration.







Abstract
&#960; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8722;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.

Via theoretical screening and well-designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8722;Csp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bonds in GDY can render sp&#8722;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top-ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as-proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal-free catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on a sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) were dramatically improved by a gradient heating synthetic strategy. The new framework material displayed a superior hydrogen evolution activity of over 100&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. In this study, we have implemented a gradient heating strategy to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;JLU100, exhibiting high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and carrier mobility for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Pt&#8208;doped COF&#8208;JLU100 demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution rate of over 100&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm). Experimental and theoretical studies corroborate that the cyano&#8208;vinylene segments in COF&#8208;JLU100 extend the &#960;&#8208;delocalization and enable fast charge transfer and separation rates as well as good dispersion in water. Moreover, COF&#8208;JLU100 can be prepared by low&#8208;cost and easily available monomers and has excellent stability, which is desirable for practical solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Functionalities for Modulating Surface Potentials in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but different functional groups ranging from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing on the pore channel were pre&#8208;designed as TENGs platform and further used to protect the cathodic current of carbon steel. Besides, the corresponding output performance of the COF&#8208;TENG to be precisely tuned through the transmit effects of surface sites to the polygonal backbones.







Abstract
Designing materials with high triboelectric is an efficient way of improving output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Herein, we synthesized a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but various functional groups ranging between electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing. These COFs form an ideal platform for clarifying the contribution of each group to TENG performance because the pore wall is perturbed in a predesigned manner. Kelvin probe force microscopy and computational data suggest that surface potentials and electron affinities of COFs can be improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, with the highest values observed for fluorinated COF. The TENG with fluorinated COF delivered an output voltage and current of 420&#8197;V and 64&#8197;&#956;A, respectively, which are comparable to other reported materials. This strategy can be used to efficiently screen suitable frameworks as TENG materials with excellent output performance.

         <dc:description>
A powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; that was able to difluoromethylate a variety of aryl and alkyl electrophiles was developed. In the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 also reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[Cu(Cl2)]&#8722; and [(DPPF)Pd(Cl)2].







Abstract
The quest of the active species in copper&#8208;mediated difluoromethylation of aryl halides led to the discovery of a powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; 2. Complex 2 was able to difluoromethylate a variety of electrophiles including electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides, heteroaryl iodides, activated heteroaryl bromides, chloride and aryl bromides with a directing group, as well as other electrophiles such as alkenyl iodide, benzyl bromides, allyl bromides, alkyl iodide, allyl carbonates and acid chloride. In addition, in the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[CuCl2]&#8722; and [(DPPF)PdCl2].

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. The most stable isomer of Be4B12+ cluster is a closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms.







Abstract
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. When beryllium is gradually added to the B12 motif, it undergoes drastic structural modifications. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is an Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium forms strong bonding with the boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interactions. For instance, the bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ fragment in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12, followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.

         <title>Pas de Deux of an NO Couple: Synchronous Photoswitching from a Double&#8208;Linear to a Double&#8208;Bent Ru(NO)2 Core under Nitrosyl Charge Conservation</title>

The picture shows the transition state (TS) which connects the double&#8208;linear ground state (GS) with the double&#8208;bent metastable state (MS) of the dinitrosylruthenium compound [Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2] (1). The TS's strongly negative vibrational mode (&#8722;831&#8197;cm&#8722;1) traces the decay path if the photo&#8208;generated MS is warmed above 230&#8197;K. 1 provides the first example of synchronous photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) involving two ligands (see Supporting Information for an animation of the movement).







Abstract
The {Ru(NO)2}10 dinitrosylruthenium complex [Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2] (1) shows photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) of a special kind: the two NO ligands switch, on photo&#8208;excitation, synchronously from the ground state (GS) with two almost linear RuNO functions to a metastable state (MS) which persists up to 230&#8197;K and can be populated to &#8776;50&#8201;%. The MS was experimentally characterised by photo&#8208;crystallography, IR spectroscopy and DS&#8208;calorimetry as a double&#8208;bent variant of the double&#8208;linear GS. The experimental results are confirmed by computation which unravels the GS/MS transition as a disrotatory synchronous 50&#176; turn of the two nitrosyl ligands. Although 1 shows the usual redshift of the N&#8722;O stretch on bending the MNO unit, there is no increased charge transfer from Ru to NO along the GS&#8208;to&#8208;MS path. In terms of the effective&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state (EOS) method, both isomers of 1 and the transition state are Ru&#8722;II(NO+)2 species.

         <title>Halogen Atom Participation in Guiding the Stereochemical Outcomes of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic additions to &#945;&#8208;haloacetals proceed via an oxocarbenium ion intermediate where the carbon&#8208;halogen bond can either adopt a pseudo&#8208;axial or a pseudo&#8208;equatorial position. trans&#8208;Selectivity is typically observed when a halogen atom is positioned at C&#8208;2 of an acetal because hyperconjugative interactions involving the pseudo&#8208;axial carbon&#8208;halogen bond stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.







Abstract
Acetal substitution reactions of &#945;&#8208;halogenated five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings can be highly stereoselective. Erosion of stereoselectivity occurs as nucleophilicity increases, which is consistent with additions to a halogen&#8208;stabilized oxocarbenium ion, not a three&#8208;membered&#8208;ring halonium ion. Computational investigations confirmed that the open&#8208;form oxocarbenium ions are the reactive intermediates involved. Kinetic studies suggest that hyperconjugative effects and through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions can both contribute to the stabilization of halogen&#8208;substituted oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Double Confinement Hydrogel Network Enables Continuously Regenerative Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;confinement&#8208;cavity engineering strategy is developed for fabrication of hydrogel photocatalyst toward water splitting. The size&#8208;confinement effect as well as reversible metal coordination enable the resultant hydrogel network with excellent performance in the photocatalytic H2 production and NIR&#8208;regenerable behavior.







Abstract
Soft matter catalyst system allowing controllable manipulation of the organized nanostructure and surface property holds the potential for renewable energy. Here we demonstrate the construction of a continuously regenerative hydrogel photocatalyst that confines the metal&#8208;thiolate coordination induced nanocavity into robust micro&#8208;sized spongy network for water splitting. Thanks to low vaporization enthalpy and fast proton mobility of water molecules confining in nanocavities, the composite delivers outstanding photocatalytic H2 production (TOF of 4568&#8197;H2&#8201;h&#8722;1), nearly 4.5&#8197;times higher than that on the catalyst without confinements. Incorporating with conductive polymers, the TOF is substantially improved to 7819&#8197;H2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Impressively, continuous regeneration is for the first time achieved with H2 production retention improved from 24&#8201;% to 72&#8201;% by regulating optically&#8208;active catalyst surfaces. This optical regeneration method provides new avenues for sustainable solar energy conversion.

         <title>Influence of Phase Transitions on Diffusive Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive transport of a hydrophobic cation, measured with nonlinear light scattering, across the membrane of liposomes composed of E. coli lipid extracts increases dramatically at membrane phase transition temperatures.







Abstract
Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug&#8208;releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time&#8208;resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#8201;&#176;C to 36&#8201;&#176;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid&#8208;disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#8201;&#176;C and 27.6&#8201;&#176;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the liquid&#8208;disordered phase at 36&#8201;&#176;C is 35&#8208;times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;s&#8722;1 of the gel phase at 9&#8201;&#176;C. For the mixed&#8208;phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid&#8208;disordered bulk.

Nanoelectrochemistry using single&#8208;particle collisions&#160;on microelectrode&#160;supported by spectroscopic and theoretical studies provide insights into the molecular interactions of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at single&#8208;particle scale. This new approach provides the foundational knowledge to advance the design of materials and methods for the ultrasensitive detection of these chemicals, as reported by Silvana Andreescu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202209164).

         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a phthalocyanine, through simple solid&#8208;state static aging, is reported in the Communication (e202209033) by Sandra Kaabel, Eduardo Anaya&#8208;Plaza et&#8197;al. This greener approach diminishes up to 100&#8208;fold the solvent usage of the traditional solution synthesis. Several metal derivatives (Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+), as well as electron&#8208;deficient derivatives were synthesized. The image shows the crude zinc tetra(tBu)phthalocyanine as obtained.

Selenoviologens&#8208;appendant metallacycles M1 (rhomboid) and M2 (hexagonal) were synthesized and utilized in electrochromism and photocatalysis, as reported in the Research Article (e202209054) by Gang He et&#8197;al. The highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states of the selenoviologens (SeV2+) originate from the metallacyclic effect. Their properties were validated by femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), demonstrating the vital role of the metallacycle in organic photocatalytic reactions.

Mechanochromic mechanophores visualize stress applied to polymers. In their Communication (e202209225), Christoph Weder, Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#8197;al. demonstrate the first cyclophane mechanophore utilizing charge&#8211;transfer complex emission. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change between orange and blue upon deformation. The spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher leads to vivid mechanochromic luminescence.

         <title>Energy Transfer Chemiluminescent Spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Probes for Bioanalyte Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy transfer from chemiluminescent spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffolds to dyes in the proximity allows signal amplification while affording luminescence in the biologically relevant red/near infrared region. Strategies to promote such donor&#8211;acceptor interactions include polymeric entrapment, host&#8211;guest encapsulation, and direct tethering of organic and inorganic fluorophores.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging of bioanalytes using spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes has gained significant attention due to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and imaging depth compared to excitation&#8208;based probes, as well as their modifiable scaffolds that offer analyte&#8208;specific responses and tunable emissive properties. Among several strategies employed to amplify signals under aqueous conditions and to shift the emission into the bio&#8208;relevant red region, energy transfer to an adjacent fluorophore is a popular and effective method. This Minireview highlights spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based probes that operate via an energy transfer mechanism to detect bioanalytes both in vitro and in vivo. Probes that display both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions with fluorophores, as well as their applications in imaging specific analytes will be discussed.

         <title>Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to Methanol: The Renaissance of Low&#8208;Temperature Catalysis in the Context of the Methanol Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of renewable methanol using recycled CO2 and green H2 is a long&#8208;term solution to address the carbon conundrum and achieve a sustainable economy. This Review reflects on the key developments in low&#8208;temperature methanol synthesis from CO2 and CO using homogeneous catalysts. The integration of direct air capture of CO2 and its conversion to methanol as a promising avenue in &#8220;air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel&#8221; technologies is also highlighted.







Abstract
The traditional economy based on carbon&#8208;intensive fuels and materials has led to an exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 levels increased by 50&#8201;% since the pre&#8208;industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed methanol economy pioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO2 to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction, homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO2, CO and their derivatives as potential low&#8208;temperature alternatives to the commercial processes. This Review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.

         <title>Upgrading Organic Compounds through the Coupling of Electrooxidation with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the latest achievements and milestones in coupling the electrooxidation of organic compounds and the hydrogen evolution in a hybrid water electrolyzer. Emphasis is placed on exploiting the anode reaction and the design of the electrocatalyst. Prospects for the future development of this coupling technology and its potential implementation in practical organic synthesis and hydrogen production are also provided.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic splitting of water is recognized to be the most sustainable and clean technology for the production of hydrogen (H2). Unfortunately, the efficiency is seriously restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In contrast to the OER, the electrooxidation of organic compounds (EOO) is more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Thus, the coupling of the EOO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as an alternative route, as it can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency for the production of H2. Simultaneously, value&#8208;added organic compounds can be generated on the anode through electrooxidation upgrading. In this Minireview, we highlight the latest progress and milestones in coupling the EOO with the HER. Emphasis is focused on the design of the anode catalyst, understanding the reaction mechanism, and the construction of the electrolyzer. Moreover, challenges and prospects are offered relating to the future development of this emerging technology.

         <title>Luminescence Lifetime Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight related luminescence mechanisms, selected techniques of luminescence lifetime imaging based on lanthanide nanoparticles, and their advanced applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data storage, bio&#8208;multiplexing, and biosensing.







Abstract
Luminescence lifetime imaging has exhibited significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification detection because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetimes. Recently, great emphasis has been put on the exploration of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long&#8208;lived luminescence. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter out background signals during imaging, but also provides a wide range of tunable lifetime. Here, we introduce the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs, the key strategies for luminescence lifetime modulation, data acquisition methods, and several cutting&#8208;edge applications in lifetime imaging systems. Then we describe several prospects to inspire efforts for improving technologies and extending applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.

Many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. Most of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations apply various combinations of DFT&#8208;based methods. This Scientific Perspective provides best&#8208;practice protocols and guidance in the choice of robust method combinations to deal with many day&#8208;to&#8208;day challenges in computational chemistry and discusses representative examples.







Abstract
Nowadays, many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. The lion's share of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations applies density functional theory (DFT) evaluated in atomic&#8208;orbital basis sets. This work provides best&#8208;practice guidance on the numerous methodological and technical aspects of DFT calculations in three parts: Firstly, we set the stage and introduce a step&#8208;by&#8208;step decision tree to choose a computational protocol that models the experiment as closely as possible. Secondly, we present a recommendation matrix to guide the choice of functional and basis set depending on the task at hand. A particular focus is on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency through multi&#8208;level approaches. Finally, we discuss selected representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and the effect of methodological choices.

         <title>Metal Nanoparticles on Lipophilic Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basal planes of lipophilic nanographenes were utilized for anchoring metal nanoparticles. Six metal cations were confirmed to form metal nanoparticles with a few to tens of nanometer in diameter. Palladium nanoparticle&#8208;doped lipophilic nanographenes displayed catalytic function in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling reaction.







Abstract
Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis. Reported examples employ hydrophilic graphene oxides as substrates, making it difficult to coexist with organic substrates in organic solvents. The title NGs are metal NP&#8208;doped lipophilic NGs (M&#8208;NG1). Various metal cations form NPs with a diameter of a few to tens of nanometers on the basal plane. Owing to the lipophilic nature of NG1, M&#8208;NG1 is prepared by the reduction of the basal plane with sodium in THF followed by the addition of metal salts. Au&#8208;NPs on NG1 allow anchoring an organic thiol carrying an anthracene fluorophore, which is a proof of concept of composite materials utilizing the surface of NGs. The assessment of the catalytic function of Pd&#8208;NG1 reveals that chlorobenzene and bromobenzene yield a coupling product, and fluorobenzene also undergoes the reactions, demonstrating the catalytic function of Pd&#8208;NG1.

&lt;p&gt;The basal planes of lipophilic nanographenes were utilized for anchoring metal nanoparticles. Six metal cations were confirmed to form metal nanoparticles with a few to tens of nanometer in diameter. Palladium nanoparticle-doped lipophilic nanographenes displayed catalytic function in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis. Reported examples employ hydrophilic graphene oxides as substrates, making it difficult to coexist with organic substrates in organic solvents. The title NGs are metal NP-doped lipophilic NGs (M-&lt;b&gt;NG1&lt;/b&gt;). Various metal cations form NPs with a diameter of a few to tens of nanometers on the basal plane. Owing to the lipophilic nature of &lt;b&gt;NG1&lt;/b&gt;, M-&lt;b&gt;NG1&lt;/b&gt; is prepared by the reduction of the basal plane with sodium in THF followed by the addition of metal salts. Au-NPs on &lt;b&gt;NG1&lt;/b&gt; allow anchoring an organic thiol carrying an anthracene fluorophore, which is a proof of concept of composite materials utilizing the surface of NGs. The assessment of the catalytic function of Pd-&lt;b&gt;NG1&lt;/b&gt; reveals that chlorobenzene and bromobenzene yield a coupling product, and fluorobenzene also undergoes the reactions, demonstrating the catalytic function of Pd-&lt;b&gt;NG1&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Splitting of Mono&#8208; and Dibranched Hexane Isomers by a Robust Zinc&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high surface area and optimal pore aperture has been used for the discrimination of alkane isomers. It adsorbs linear and monobranched alkanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, with high capacities and selectivities, outperforming other splitters for alkane isomers.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency separation of C6 alkanes, particularly the mono&#8208; and dibranched isomers by using porous solids, is of paramount significance in the petrochemical industry and, remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we report the complete separation of linear/monobranched hexanes from their dibranched isomers through selective size&#8208;exclusion by a microporous MOF, Zn&#8208;tcpt (H3tcpt=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine), with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of hms nets. Importantly, its adsorption capacity and selectivity are notably higher than those of the previously reported adsorbents that can split mono&#8208; and dibranched alkane isomers. Dynamic breakthrough measurements verify the excellent separation of C6 alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt, and the size&#8208;exclusion based separation mechanism has been confirmed by ab initio materials modeling. The high&#8208;efficiency separation of alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt can be attributed to its optimal pore dimensions as well as high porosity.

         <title>A Hybrid Antiperovskite with Strong Linear and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>

Hybrid halide antiperovskite Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) could not only double the frequency of incident ray with very strong SHG response but also divide an incident ray into polarized o ray and e ray with exceptionally large birefringence.







Abstract
Antiperovskites have been studied since the 1980s because of their rich physical and chemical properties, but their linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses remain largely unknown. Here we report a new polar crystal, Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) (I), which features a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional antiperovskite structure composed of ClCs6 polyhedra and A&#8208;site [HC3N3S3]2&#8722; rings. To our best knowledge, this kind of antiperovskite structure is reported for the first time. Remarkably, I exhibits a very strong nonlinear optical response up to 11.4 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4 and exceptionally large birefringence of 0.52. The first&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that [HC3N3S3]2&#8722; is the &#8220;material gene&#8221; while the antiperovskite structural feature making it in a favorable arrangement. This work provides a new structural platform for the rational design of integrated optoelectronic materials with linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses.

         <title>A Greener Route to Blue: Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, the first high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state synthesis of a phthalocyanine dye is shown. These organic dyes are broadly applicable, while the inherent low solubility has so far challenged the sustainability of their synthesis. The developed solid&#8208;state approach for the synthesis of tBu&#8208;phthalocyanine in catalytic amounts of dimethylaminoethanol, avoids bulk solvents and harsh temperatures, while achieving excellent yields.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are important organic dyes with a broad applicability in optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing and nanomedicine. Currently, phthalocyanines are synthetized in high boiling organic solvents, like dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), which is a flammable, corrosive, and bioactive substance, miscible with water and harmful to the environment. Here we show a new solid&#8208;state approach for the high&#8208;yielding synthesis of phthalocyanines, which reduces up to 100&#8208;fold the amount of DMAE. Through systematic screening of solid&#8208;state reaction parameters, carried out by ball&#8208;milling and aging, we reveal the influence of key variables&#8212;temperature, presence of a template, and the amount and role of DMAE in the conversion of tBu phthalonitrile to tetra&#8208;tBu phthalocyanine. These results set the foundations to synthesize these high&#8208;performance dyes through a greener approach, opening the field of solid&#8208;state synthesis to a wider family of phthalocyanines.

         <title>Stereoretentive Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylation of Isoxazolinones by a Planar Chiral Palladacycle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric allylic substitutions usually display a pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (E)&#8208;configured C=C double bonds as a result of &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd intermediates. A planar chiral palladacycle is shown to permit a catalytic asymmmetric allylation reaction maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in highly enantioenriched products.







Abstract
The catalytic allylic substitution is one of the most important tools in asymmetric synthesis to form C&#8722;C bonds in an enantioselective way. While high efficiency was previously accomplished in terms of enantio&#8208; and regiocontrol using different catalyst types, a strong general limitation is a very pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (E)&#8208;configured C=C double bonds. Herein, we report that with a planar chiral palladacycle catalyst a diastereospecific reaction outcome is achieved using isoxazolinones and allylic imidates as substrates, thus maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in the highly enantioenriched products. DFT calculations show that the reactions proceed via an SN2 mechanism and not via &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd complexes. Crucial for the high control is the stabilization of the allylic fragment in the SN2 transition state by &#960;&#8208;interactions with the phenyl substituents of the pentaphenylferrocenyl catalyst core.

         <title>High&#8208;Humidity Shaker Aging to Access Chitin and Cellulose Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance. It relies on a new mechanochemical method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA), involving mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate.







Abstract
To unlock nature's potential for functional biomaterials, many efforts have been devoted to isolating the nanocrystalline domains within the supramolecular structure of polysaccharides. Yet, low reactivity and yield in aqueous systems along with excessive solvent usage hinders its development. In this report, the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance is described, relying on a new method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA). The method involves a mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate. Insights into the mechanism were uncovered, which highlighted the unique role of high humidity to afford a gradual uptake of water by the material up to deliquescence when the reaction is complete. This process was then validated for direct synthesis of nanocrystals from biomass sources including crab and soft wood pulp.

         <title>Unravelling the Reactivity of Framework Lewis Acid Sites towards Methanol Activation on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al Lewis acid sites that are bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations. The high reactivity of these framework&#8208;associated Al sites leads to the preferable formation of methoxy species in methanol reaction at lower temperature, which contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons at high temperature as active C1 species.







Abstract
Understanding the acid sites on zeolites is vital for the establishment of catalyst structure&#8211;activity relationship and exploration of their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the identification of active framework Lewis acid sites on ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites. The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al that is bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined by using one&#8208; dimensional (1D) 31P and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 31P&#8208;{27Al} NMR spectroscopy of trimethylphosphine oxide probe molecule. 2D 13C&#8208;{27Al} NMR correlation experiments allow the observation of favorable formation of methoxy species on the framework&#8208;associated Al Lewis acid sites in methanol reaction at low temperature, which is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These methoxy species contribute to the further conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons as active C1 species. The results provide new insights into the Lewis acidity of zeolites.

         <title>Excited State Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes Enable Fluorescence Color Changes in a Supramolecular Cyclophane Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore is developed. The mechanophore exhibits charge&#8208;transfer complex emission in the force&#8208;free state and exhibits monomer emission upon application of mechanical force due to spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change. The emission change is correlated with the applied stress.







Abstract
Mechanochromic mechanophores are reporter molecules that indicate mechanical events through changes of their photophysical properties. Supramolecular mechanophores in which the activation is based on the rearrangement of luminophores and/or quenchers without any covalent bond scission, remain less well investigated. Here, we report a cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore that contains a 1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophore and a pyromellitic diimide quencher. In solution, the blue monomer emission of the luminophore is largely quenched and a faint reddish&#8208;orange emission originating from a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex is observed. A polyurethane elastomer containing the mechanophore displays orange emission in the absence of force, which is dominated by the CT&#8208;emission. Mechanical deformation causes a decrease of the CT&#8208;emission and an increase of blue monomer emission, due to the spatial separation between the luminophore and quencher. The ratio of the two emission intensities correlates with the applied stress.

         <title>An Inorganic Huisgen Reaction between a 1,2&#8208;Diboraallene and an Azide to Access a Diboratriazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the regioselective cycloaddition of 1,2&#8208;diboraallene with aryl azide, namely, Huisgen 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, affords an aromatic diboratriazole derivative. The diboratriazole readily releases N2 without the aid of any catalysts to furnish a 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative.







Abstract
Regioselective Huisgen cycloaddition reaction between 1,2&#8208;diboraallene and azide proceeds under catalyst&#8208;free and mild conditions to furnish a diboratriazole (2). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N3 five&#8208;membered ring of (2), indicating its aromatic features. Molecule (2) spontaneously releases N2 to form the 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative (3). The mechanism of a whole reaction profile was extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Thanks to aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect with restriction of intramolecular rotations principle, J&#8208;aggregate nature and large center&#8208;to&#8208;center distance in crystalline states, high external quantum efficiency of 9.44&#8201;% with emission peak at 711&#8197;nm were actualized in non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on 6&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;8&#8208;(4&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(phenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;6H&#8208;indolo [2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD).







Abstract
Constructing organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials to confront the formidable barrier of &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; remains challenging. Herein, two NIR thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules named T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD and TIQD were developed by connecting N,N&#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;amine and triphenylamine with a novel electron withdrawing unit 6&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile. It is confirmed NIR&#8208;TADF emitters concurrent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect, J&#8208;aggregate with intra&#8208; and intermolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and large center&#8208;to&#8208;center distance in solid states can boost the emissive efficiencies both in thin films and non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Consequently, the T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD&#8208;based non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLED achieved the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.44&#8201;% with emission peak at 711&#8197;nm, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Two Radical SAM Enzymes Are Necessary and Sufficient for the In Vitro Production of the Oxetane Nucleoside Antiviral Agent Albucidin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the oxetane nucleoside albucidin was demonstrated in vitro to proceed in two steps involving the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction reaction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which is responsible for the elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. These activities are uncommon among the presently described radical SAM enzymes.







Abstract
Oxetanocin&#8197;A and albucidin are two oxetane natural products. While the biosynthesis of oxetanocin&#8197;A has been described, less is known about albucidin. In this work, the albucidin biosynthetic gene cluster is identified in Streptomyces. Heterologous expression in a nonproducing strain demonstrates that the genes alsA and alsB are necessary and sufficient for albucidin biosynthesis confirming a previous study (Myronovskyi et&#8197;al. Microorganisms 2020, 8, 237). A two&#8208;step construction of albucidin 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphate from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine monophosphate (2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP) is shown to be catalyzed in vitro by the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which catalyzes elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. Isotope labelling studies show that AlsB catalysis begins with stereospecific H&#8208;atom transfer of the C2&#8242;&#8208;pro&#8208;R hydrogen from 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP to 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, and that the eliminated one&#8208;carbon fragment originates from C3&#8242; of 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hydrazides by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was performed using one&#8208;pot sequential catalysis based on the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by phase&#8208;transfer N&#8208;alkylation. Chiral hydrazides were obtained with high yields and stereocontrol using commercially available reagents and catalysts. The permutation of catalysts allowed for a stereodivergent approach to a new class of atropisomers.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was achieved using a sequential catalysis protocol. This strategy is based on a one&#8208;pot sequence of two organocatalytic cycles featuring the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by nitrogen alkylation under phase&#8208;transfer conditions. The resulting axially chiral hydrazides were obtained directly from commercially available reagents in high yields and with good stereocontrol. The permutation of organocatalysts allowed easy access to all stereoisomers, enabling a stereodivergent approach to enantioenriched atropisomeric hydrazides.

Spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are important scaffolds in diversified bioactive compounds, but asymmetric synthesis of chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction of N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodo&#8208;aryl)&#8208;propiolamides with nitrones has been developed, affording chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indoline]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diones as single diastereomers with high yields and good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are important scaffolds in diverse bioactive compounds. Current efforts to synthesize spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are limited to chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines]. Asymmetric synthesis of structurally similar chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/aryl C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction is described. This provides a straightforward access to densely functionalized chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indoline]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diones in good yields and with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>The N&#1013;&#8208;Rule for Serine, but Not Cysteine Catalytic Triads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;containing catalytic triads are almost exclusively N&#1013;&#8208;configured (the histidine N&#1013; atom is next to the nucleophile). This is in stark contrast to cysteine catalytic triads (and non&#8208;catalytic triads). It is argued that the effect stems from the pKa difference of the histidine nitrogen atoms. The N&#1013;&#8208;triads are evolutionarily selected for at the cost of stability to help overcome the Ser&#8208;His pKa gradient much larger than that of the Cys&#8208;His pair.







Abstract
Catalytic triads, composed of a serine or cysteine nucleophile, a histidine, and a third triad residue (typically Asp/Glu/Asn), are common in enzyme active sites and catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions. Two types of triads can be distinguished: We refer to them as N&#948;&#8208; or N&#1013;&#8208;configured, depending on whether the histidine imidazole N&#948; or N&#1013; atom is close to the nucleophile O&#947;/S&#947;. In this study, we have analyzed triad configuration. In structural triads, the more stable N&#948;&#8208;configuration predominates. For catalytic triads, the configuration depends on the nucleophile. When it is a cysteine residue, both configuration types occur, depending on the family. However, when the nucleophile is a serine residue, the less stable N&#1013;&#8208;configuration is almost exclusively found. We posit that the energetically less favored conformation is selected for in serine triads to facilitate the otherwise difficult proton transfer from the nucleophile to the histidine residue.

         <title>Hydrophobicity Directed Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: Diacetylene&#8208;Cored Pseudopeptide Chiral Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer psuedopeptides with rigid dialkyne core showed hydrophobically driven chiral self&#8208;assembly with AIE. They self&#8208;assembled to vesicles in acetonitrile, while supramolecular helices in 90&#8201;% H2O/DMSO. These self&#8208;assembling pseudopeptides devoid of LC property, act as chiral dopants that direct the non&#8208;chiral LC matrix into helical assembly.







Abstract
Here we delineate simple and tunable hydrophobically driven chiral functional assemblies of diacetylene cored pseudopeptides. These amino acid appended, rigid core dialkynes constitute promising chiral supramolecular building blocks for materials properties engineering. The chiral appended amino acid elements allow for simple tuning of solubility and interaction properties as well as governing chirality, while the central dialkyne core can impart hydrophobically driven assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The self&#8208;assembly of these rod&#8208;like dialkynes can be regulated by tuning the solvent environment, with for example self&#8208;assembly into vesicles in acetonitrile and into helical organization with AIE in a H2O/DMSO mixture. Of additional high interest, these supramolecular materials, themselves devoid of liquid crystal (LC) properties, can induce chirality into non&#8208;chiral LC matrices with high helical twisting power.

         <title>Chloride Ion Adsorption Enables Ampere&#8208;Level CO2 Electroreduction over Silver Hollow Fiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;coordination adsorbed Cl&#8722; on the surface of silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) not only suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction but also optimizes the kinetics of CO2 reduction to CO at ampere&#8208;level current density.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable feedstocks is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. However, it remains a challenge to possess a large current density, a high faradaic efficiency and excellent stability for practical applications of CO2 utilization. Herein, we report a facile tactic that enables exceedingly efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO by virtue of low&#8208;coordination chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption on a silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) electrode. A CO faradaic efficiency of 92.3&#8201;% at a current density of one ampere per square centimeter (1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 3.0&#8197;M KCl with a sustained performance observed during a 150&#8208;hour test was achieved, which is better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a low&#8208;coordination Cl&#8722; adsorption on surface of Ag HF, which not only suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also facilitated the CO2 reduction kinetics.

[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species. This compound is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 to generate an ion&#8208;separated species featuring a significantly short Al&#8722;C bond with Al=C &#960; bonding character. The Al=C moiety does not only undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H activation, but intermolecularly cleaves the N=N double bond of a diazo compound.







Abstract
[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion (3) and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species (4). Compound (4) is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 gas under the mild reaction condition to generate an ion&#8208;separated species 5. An X&#8208;ray study shows that the anionic part of 5 bears a considerable short exocyclic Al&#8722;C bond, and computational studies involving molecular orbital and natural bond orbital analysis indicate the Al=C &#960; bonding character. The Al=C moiety of 5 undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation. Moreover, reaction of 5 with a diazo compound leads to the reduction and complete cleavage of the N=N double bond.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Limaspermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Kopsinine by a Nitroaryl Transfer Cascade Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Nitrobenzenesulfonamides can be exploited as functional protective groups by their use in a long&#8208;range nitroarene transfer cascade reaction. Using a suitably functionalized precursor, this process was used as the key step in the enantioselective total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinine as well as the unnatural alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tetra&#8208;hydrokopsifoline D.







Abstract
We report an intramolecular conjugate addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles/E1cb cascade of 2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonamide&#8208;functionalized cyclohexenones as a new entry to the core scaffold of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The method was applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinine, as well as the framework of the kopsifoline alkaloids, thus highlighting its complementarity to existing approaches involving the use of indole&#8208;based starting materials or the interrupted Fischer indole synthesis. Furthermore, we show that the cascade tolerates various substituents on the nitroarene, opening the way to other natural products as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.

         <title>Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals Selective Interactions of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) with Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrochemistry using single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;microelectrode collisions supported by spectroscopic and theoretical studies provide insight into the molecular behavior of PFAS at single&#8208;particle scale. The new approach can be used for the ultrasensitive measurement of selected PFASs and accelerate the design of materials and methods that can bind and detect these substances.







Abstract
Nanoelectrochemistry allows for the investigation of the interaction of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the elucidation of the binding behaviour of PFASs to nanoscale surfaces with high sensitivity. Mechanistic studies supported by single particle collision electrochemistry (SPCE), spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the capability of polyfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a representative PFAS, to selectively bind and induce aggregation of AgNPs. Single&#8208;particle measurements provide identification of the &#8220;discrete&#8221; AgNPs agglomeration (e.g. 2&#8211;3 NPs) formed through the inter&#8208;particles F&#8722;F interactions and the selective replacement of the citrate stabilizer by the sulfonate of the PFOS. Such interactions are characteristic only for long chain PFAS (&#8208;SO3&#8722;) providing a means to selectively identify these substances down to ppt levels. Measuring and understanding the interactions of PFAS at nanoscale surfaces are crucial for designing ultrasensitive methods for detection and for modelling and predicting their interaction in the environment.

         <title>Formation of Organic Acids and Carbonyl Compounds in n&#8208;Butane Oxidation via &#947;&#8208;Ketohydroperoxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry in conjunction with single photon tunable synchrotron radiation provides clear experimental evidence of organic acids and carbonyl formation from &#947;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide decomposition via the Korcek mechanism. These results provide experimental and computational bounds that enable the construction of more realistic and accurate chemical kinetic mechanisms for autoignition chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial chain&#8208;branching step in autoignition is the decomposition of ketohydroperoxides (KHP) to form an oxy radical and OH. Other pathways compete with chain&#8208;branching, such as &#8220;Korcek&#8221; dissociation of &#947;&#8208;KHP to a carbonyl and an acid. Here we characterize the formation of a &#947;&#8208;KHP and its decomposition to formic acid+acetone products from observations of n&#8208;butane oxidation in two complementary experiments. In jet&#8208;stirred reactor measurements, KHP is observed above 590&#8197;K. The KHP concentration decreases with increasing temperature, whereas formic acid and acetone products increase. Observation of characteristic isotopologs acetone&#8208;d3 and formic acid&#8208;d0 in the oxidation of CH3CD2CD2CH3 is consistent with a Korcek mechanism. In laser&#8208;initiated oxidation experiments of n&#8208;butane, formic acid and acetone are produced on the timescale of KHP removal. Modelling the time&#8208;resolved production of formic acid provides an estimated upper limit of 2&#8197;s&#8722;1 for the rate coefficient of KHP decomposition to formic acid+acetone.

         <title>Megalo&#8208;Cavitands: Synthesis of Acridane[4]arenes and Formation of Large, Deep Cavitands for Selective C70 Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), synthesized in only six steps, has been shown to be suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C70.







Abstract
Deep cavitands, concave molecular containers, represent an important supramolecular host class that has been explored for a variety of applications ranging from sensing, switching, purification and adsorption to catalysis. A major limitation in the field has been the cavitand volume that is restricted by the size of the structural platform utilized (diameter approx. 7&#8197;&#197;). We here report the synthesis of a novel, unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with mM to sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C60 and C70. Furthermore, the selective binding of fullerene C70 in the presence of C60 was demonstrated.

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8208;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8208;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084% per cycle decay rate at 2 C during 8150 cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.</dc:description>

         <title>New Insights into Physical Aging&#8208;Induced Structure Evolution in Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CMS membranes derived from polyimide precursors show dual model morphologies comprising a disordered continuous phase and distributed molecular sieving Langmuir domains. Our study showed during physical aging, pore structure changes in the two different &#8220;C&#8221; phase and &#8220;L&#8221; domains both occur, which affects the gas separation performance of CMS membranes.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes offer the best available combination of scalable economical processability with excellent separation performance. Physical aging of CMS membranes causes pore structure changes over time that affect CMS membrane performance. To provide fundamental insights into the structure evolution in CMS membranes during physical aging, a combined dual&#8208;mode sorption and transport model is used in this study to characterize the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in fresh and 7&#8208;day vacuum aged CMS membranes. The results show physical aging of CMS membrane is primarily &#8220;diffusion related&#8221; and such aging behavior simultaneously causes ultramicropore changes in the continuous phase and Langmuir phase of CMS membrane. The new insights offered in this study suggest strategies to control the physical aging of CMS membranes and even use it as a valuable tool to tune the separation performance of CMS membranes for demanding gas separations.

         <title>Microbial Fermentation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Plastic Waste for the Production of Chemicals or Electricity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with Ideonella sakaiensis releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Here, a fermentative metabolic pathway in Ideonella sakaiensis was uncovered facilitating PET degradation while producing valuable feedstock chemicals or electricity in a microbial fuel cell with Geobacter sulfurreducens. This &#8216;plastic fermentation&#8217; process provides opportunities for future bioenergy technologies while combating plastic pollution.







Abstract
Ideonella sakaiensis (I.&#8197;sakaiensis) can grow on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the major carbon and energy source. Previous work has shown that PET conversion in the presence of oxygen released carbon dioxide and water while yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that I.&#8197;sakaiensis is a facultative anaerobe that ferments PET to the feedstock chemicals acetate and ethanol in the absence of oxygen. In addition to PET, the pure monomer ethylene glycol (EG), the intermediate product ethanol, and the carbohydrate fermentation test substance maltose can also serve as fermenting substrates. Co&#8208;culturing of I.&#8197;sakaiensis with the electrogenic and acetate&#8208;consuming Geobacter sulfurreducens produced electricity from PET or EG. This newly identified plastic fermentation process by I.&#8197;sakaiensis provides thus a novel biosynthetic route to produce high&#8208;value chemicals or electricity from plastic waste streams.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Redistribution between Hydrosilanes and Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silanes are important in chemistry and material science. The self&#8208;redistribution of HSiCl3 is an industrial process to prepare SiH4, which is widely used in electronics and automobile industries. However, selective silane cross&#8208;redistribution to prepare advanced silanes is challenging. We now report an enthalpy&#8208;driven silane cross&#8208;redistribution to access bis&#8208;silanes that contain two different types of Si&#8208;H bonds in the same molecule. Compared with entropy&#8208;driven reactions, the enthalpy&#8208;driven reaction shows high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope (62 examples) and high atom economy. Our combined experimental and computational study indicates that the reaction proceeds through a Ni(0)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(IV) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Formal Suzuki&#8722;Miyaura Coupling of Simple Ketones Enabled by Activation of Unstrained C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of ketones as electrophiles to couple with arylboronic acid derivatives via C&#8211;C bond activation has become a significant progress in the area of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction, in which a permanent or temporary directing group is often required to promote the activation of the unstrained C&#8211;C bond via oxidative addition. Herein, we disclosed the first example of directing group free formal SMC reaction of simple ketones with arylboronates via Rh&#8208;catalyzed unstrained C&#8211;C bond activation. A wide range of simple ketones, including aryl alkyl ketones, diaryl ketones and aryl perfluoroalkyl ketones, can serve as electrophiles to participate in the SMC reaction with aryl or perfluoroalkyl as the leaving group. The key to the success of this reaction is by means of nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8211;C bond without the assistance of directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of an unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte ratio to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crownphyrins: Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of the Porphyrin&#8208;Crown Ether Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crownphyrins are hybrid macrocycles combining structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral, and ionic guests. The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal&#8208;mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible. The reaction of the figure&#8208;eight mercury(II) assembly with [2.2.2]cryptand results in ring contraction providing the metal&#8208;free crownphyrin macrocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate Induced Movement of the Metal Cofactor between Active and Resting State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far&#8208;reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor&#8217;s properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from  Sphingomonas wittichii  RW1 (  Sw  HKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M  2+  R  ), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M  2+  A  ) at 2.4 &#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M  2+  A  affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M  2+  R  to M  2+  A  . While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Destruction and Assembly: Switching between Two Differently Composed Cage&#8208;Type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on two regioisomeric, diazocine ligands  1  and  2  that can both be photoswitched between the  E&#8208;  and  Z  &#8208;configurations with violet and green light. The self&#8208;assembly of the four species (  1&#8208;Z  ,  1&#8209;E,  2&#8208;Z  ,  2&#8208;E  ) with Co  II  ions was investigated upon changing the coordination vectors as a function of the ligand configuration (  E  vs  Z  ) and regioisomer (1  vs  2). With  1&#8208;Z  , Co2(1&#8208;Z)3  was self&#8208;assembled, while a mixture of ill&#8208;defined species was observed with  2&#8208;Z. Upon photoswitching with 385 nm to the  E  configurations, the opposite was observed with  1&#8208;E  forming oligomers and  2&#8208;E  forming Co2(2&#8208;E)3. Light&#8208;controlled dis/assembly was demonstrated in a ligand competition experiment with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of CoII  ions; alternating irradiation with violet and green light resulted in the reversible transformation between Co2(1&#8209;Z  )3  and Co2(2&#8208;E)3  over multiple cycles without significant fatigue by photoswitching.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne / butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12 &#8764; 14 kcal mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8208;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (p  K  a  ~42.6) of the &#945; C&#8208;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH  2  group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric a&#8208;C&#8208;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl b&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54~84% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20:1 dr and 99% ee). The &#945; C&#8208;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 10  22  times (from p  K  a  42.6 to p  K  a  20.1)  , which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8208;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Regulated Multi&#8208;State Long&#8208;Lived Emission from Star&#8208;Shaped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to utilize molecular vibration to tune triplet&#8208;involved emissions in multiple states is highly challenging. Here, star&#8208;shaped triphenylamine derivatives have been employed as model systems to understand how molecular vibration affects thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions in multiple states. Nonplanar, star&#8208;shaped conformations allow molecules to generate appropriate vibrations in the solution state, facilitating vibronic coupling between their T1 and T2 states to generate effective TADF. More importantly, a relatively dispersed state can allow the molecules to efficiently vibrate in the solid state, and a crystalline environment further promotes a more efficient TADF. Lastly, by suppressing molecular vibration to inhibit the TADF, ultra&#8208;long RTP was observed upon doping these molecules into polymers. These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiamyxins: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxobacterial RNA&#8208;Virus Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During our search for novel myxobacterial natural products, we discovered the thiamyxins: thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich non&#8208;ribosomal peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids with potent antiviral activity. We isolated four congeners of this unprecedented natural product family with the non&#8208;cyclized thiamyxin D fused to a glycerol unit at the C&#8208;terminus. Alongside their structure elucidation, we present a concise biosynthesis model based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis and isotopically labelled precursor feeding. We report incorporation of a 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylpent&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid moiety by a GCN5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase&#8208;like decarboxylase domain featuring polyketide synthase. The thiamyxins show potent inhibition of RNA&#8208;viruses in cell culture models of corona, zika and dengue virus infection. Their potency up to a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 560 nM combined with milder cytotoxic effects on human cell lines indicate a potential for further development of the thiamyxins.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8208;60 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8208;90 &#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700 h cycle at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8208;60 &#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1% at &#8208;40 &#176;C , 60.6% at &#8208;60 &#176;C at 0.5 C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5% at &#8208;40 &#176;C at 2 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly: Fabrication and Visualization of Multiblock Microstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, the bottom&#8208;up molecular strategy to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures is still rare. Herein, we proposed a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns from 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and AIEgen guest. By synergistic combination of the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guest (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of sodium cation to CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guest in salt solution, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen used here enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblock to be visualized, understood, and regulated. This work will inspire the design of more multiblock structures with controlled functional regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Assembly and Three&#8208;Dimensional Stacking of Antiaromatic 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin on HOPG</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic compounds have recently received considerable attention because of novel properties such as narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps and facile formation of mutual stacking. Here, the spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic&#160;meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) is scrutinized at the liquid&#8208;solid interface by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Polymorphism in monolayers characterized by the orthogonal and parallel assemblies is found at the low concentration of 0.05 mM. The parallel assembly is more stable and dominantly formed at higher concentrations. Aggregation was observed at concentrations&#160;&gt;&#160;0.2 mM, and the STM images of the aggregates implied the formation of stacked layers. The intrinsic electronic structures of the mutually stacked&#160;bilayer&#160;generated by applying an electric pulse to the monolayer were probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal the narrowing HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by ca. 20% from the monolayer, suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Cyclopolymerization of 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;Nonadiyne Derivatives to Synthesize Low Band Gap Conjugated Polyacetylenes Containing Fused Bicyclic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade cyclopolymerization is developed to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The regioselectivity is controlled by altering the structure of the catalyst, affording polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings. The resulting polymers show narrow band gaps due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.







Abstract
Cyclopolymerization is a powerful method for synthesizing polyacetylenes containing four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered rings. However, the structure of the repeat unit only consists of mono&#8208;cycloalkene due to the single cyclization of diyne monomers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel cascade cyclopolymerization to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings from triyne monomers containing bulky dendrons via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. These dendrons provided solubility and stability to the rigid bicyclic polyacetylene backbone. In addition, we controlled the regioselectivity of the catalyst approach by altering its structure and synthesized polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings with high molecular weights of up to 120&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Interestingly, the resulting polymers showed narrower band gaps (down to 1.6&#8197;eV) than polymers with mono&#8208;cycloalkene repeat units due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.

         <title>Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodular endoperoxide with a hypoxia sensitive functionality and fluoride&#8208;reactive stopper for the cycloreversion was synthesized. Under reductive conditions of the hypoxic cancer cells, a bioorthogonal shunt which releases cytotoxic singlet oxygen via the intermediacy of a fluoride signal becomes operative. The result is a very precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen, which opens a new path toward potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen can be generated by thermal cycloreversion of aromatic endoperoxides. However, for any practical potential of chemically generated singlet oxygen within a therapeutic context, the time and place of the release of this cytotoxic species must be tightly regulated. We now show that using a bimodular design with a hypoxia responsive unit and fluoride&#8208;triggered endoperoxide unit, a bioorthogonal metabolic shunt can be established, where an enzymatically generated submicromolar fluoride signal plays a crucial role. Thus, cellular nitroreductase is repurposed in a bioorthogonal enzymatic activity, where it releases fluoride ions upon the reduction of a targeted compound. The fluoride ions released in the initial reaction remove the silyl stopper, yielding a highly accelerated release of singlet oxygen. The result is a remarkable difference in cytotoxicity between hypoxic and normoxic conditions as evidenced by microscopy, viability assays and the use of control compounds.

         <title>Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) Tags for Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation, On&#8208;Resin Protein&#8208;Protein Coupling, and Purification of Protein Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry tags (ABC&#8208;tags) based on 2&#8208;pyridyltetrazines serve a dual role by enabling protein purification through metal chelation and still maintaining their rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging is successful for proteins tagged at the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions, is successful in complex mixtures including cell lysate, and can be carried out on&#8208;resin to generate multidomain proteins.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of proteins has broad application in chemical biology, but can be limited when mixtures result from incomplete conversion or the formation of protein containing side products. It is shown here that when proteins are covalently tagged with pyridyl&#8208;tetrazines, the nickel&#8208;iminodiacetate (Ni&#8208;IDA) resins commonly used for His&#8208;tags can be directly used for protein affinity purification. These Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) tags serve a dual role by enabling affinity&#8208;based protein purification while maintaining rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging works with a range of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods with proteins tagged at the C&#8208;terminus, N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions. ABC&#8208;tagged proteins can also be purified from complex mixtures including cell lysate. The combination of site&#8208;selective conjugation and clean&#8208;up with ABC&#8208;tagged proteins also allows for facile on&#8208;resin reactions to provide protein&#8208;protein conjugates.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Formation of Artificial Enzymes on Filamentous Phage for Ultrasensitive Direct Detection of Circulating miRNA Biomarkers in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As triggered by the target, an artificial enzyme was site&#8208;specifically formed at the tip of filamentous M13 phage, generating a novel catalytic nanomaterial for miRNA analysis. miRNAs in human plasma samples, tumor cells, and tissues were detected with high sensitivity comparable to qRT&#8208;PCR, showing a great possibility of clinical applications.







Abstract
Integrating artificial enzymes onto nanostructures target&#8208; and site&#8208;specifically is still a challenge. Here we show that target miRNAs trigger the formation of DNAzyme site&#8208;specifically at the tip of filamentous phage for detecting miRNA biomarkers. Through an antibody&#8208;modified oligonucleotide, the tip of the phage with magnetic nanoparticles on the sidewall captures a target miRNA, inducing the formation of DNAzyme that extends from the phage tip through a hybridization chain reaction. After magnetic separation, the resultant complex catalyzes a colorimetric reaction with the signal correlated to target concentrations, leading to the quantification of miRNAs with a detection limit of 5.0&#8197;fM, about 103 folds lower than the phage&#8208;free approach. Our approach can differentiate miRNA mutants and quantify miRNA in human plasma, tumor cells, and tissues with high sensitivity, suggesting that the target&#8208;triggered integration of enzymes and phages holds promise for searching for new catalysts.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Chiral Carbene&#8208;CuI&#8208;Amide Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been constructed to exhibit aggregation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence with large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027. Inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent TADF properties strongly associated with ligand&#8208;ligand rotation of enantiomer molecules were also demonstrated.







Abstract
The field of luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical&#8208;active materials has been blossoming in recent years, although chiroptical&#8208;active CMA complexes have not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been developed by using chiral phenyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, the first reported for CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand&#8208;ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of the CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these CuI enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into the optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from the perspective of aggregation states.

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in the Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the production of HCHO from CO2, including chemical catalysis (hydrogenation using H2 and hydroboration/hydrosilylation), photo/electrocatalysis, and biocatalysis (enzymatic reduction). From analysis of advantages and deficits of each methodology, we present viewpoints and potential strategies for optimizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion.







Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Vinylsilanes and Vinylboronates using Silicon or Boron as a Regioselectivity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination protocol allows simple vinylsilanes and vinylboronates to be selectively functionalized without competitive consumption of the reactive vinylmetalloid core structure, preserving its reactivity for future transformations such as cross&#8208;coupling or addition reactions. The silicon/boron group directs the regioselectivity of amination to the distal side of the C=C bond, allowing access to a complementary substitution pattern.







Abstract
Vinylsilanes and vinylboronates are common building blocks for organic synthesis, but direct functionalization of these species without the participation of either the C=C or C&#8722;Si/B bonds is rare. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction of these vinylmetalloid species that installs a new C&#8722;N bond without competing transmetallation or alkene addition. In this transformation, the silicon or boron substituent inverts the usual regioselectivity, directing amination to the site distal to that group. Subsequent cross&#8208;coupling or demetallation allows access to complementary regioisomeric products. Density Functional Theory computations revealed that the observed regioselectivity is due to a subtle combination of electronic and counterintuitive steric factors that favor initial attack of selenium at the silicon&#8208;bearing carbon atom.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Structural Motif in Lanthipeptide Synthetases for Substrate Binding and Interdomain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique structural motif for leader binding and interdomain interactions was identified in the crystal structure of the kinase domain of class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC responsible for the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. This motif consists of two N&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, a central &#945;&#8208;helix, and three C&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets.







Abstract
Class III lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze the formation of lanthionine/methyllanthionine and labionin crosslinks. We present here the 2.40&#8197;&#197; resolution structure of the kinase domain of a class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC from the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. A unique structural subunit for leader binding, named leader recognition domain (LRD), was identified. The LRD of CurKC is responsible for the recognition of the leader peptide and for mediating interactions between the lyase and kinase domains. LRDs are highly conserved among the kinase domains of class III and class IV lanthipeptide synthetases. The discovery of LRDs provides insight into the substrate recognition and domain organization in multidomain lanthipeptide synthetases.

         <title>Linker Redox Mediated Control of Morphology and Properties in Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Semiquinoid Coordination Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D semiconducting coordination polymer Fe5(C6O6)3 is reported with high conductivity, broad electronic transitions and interesting thermoelectric/magnetic properties. The unique structure and properties of this material illustrates that controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting metal&#8208;organic materials can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies, properties, and functionalities.







Abstract
The emergence of conductive 2D and less commonly 3D coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promises novel applications in many fields. However, the synthetic parameters for these electronically complex materials are not thoroughly understood. Here we report a new 3D semiconducting CP Fe5(C6O6)3, which is a fusion of 2D Fe&#8208;semiquinoid materials and 3D cubic Fex(C6O6)y materials, by using a different initial redox&#8208;state of the C6O6 linker. The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2&#963;=7.0&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature. This material illustrates how controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting CPs/MOFs can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies and properties in contrast to more commonly encountered post&#8208;synthetic modifications.

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208; and Selenol&#8208;Assisted Delivery of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although aryl thioamides are often used to assess the pharmacological effects of H2S, their reactivity is extremely sluggish and their release of H2S is highly inefficient. Herein, we report that H2S liberation from this donor class can be augmented with intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. We envision this new chemistry serving as a general design strategy for accessing efficient donors that selectively respond to various biological stimuli.







Abstract
Arylthioamides have been frequently employed to assess the chemical biology and pharmacology of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). From this class of donors, however, extremely low H2S releasing efficiencies have been reported and proper mechanistic studies have been omitted. Consequently, millimolar concentrations of arylthioamides are required to liberate just trace amounts of H2S, and via an unidentified mechanistic pathway, which obfuscates the interpretation of any biological activity that stems from their use. Herein, we report that H2S release from this valuable class of donors can be markedly enhanced through intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. Specifically, we demonstrate that both disulfide&#8208; and diselenide&#8208;linked thioamides are responsive to biologically relevant concentrations of glutathione and release two molar equivalents of H2S via an intramolecular cyclization that significantly augments their rate and efficiency of sulfide delivery in both buffer and live human cells.

         <title>Ag22 Nanoclusters with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Protected by Ag/Cyanurate/Phosphine Metallamacrocyclic Monolayers through In&#8208;Situ Ligand Transesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isostructural Metallamacrocyclic Monolayer Protected Ag22 nanoclusters were synthesized in high yields by in&#8208;situ ligand formation strategy. The high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity triazine&#8208;based cyanurate ligands endow the clusters with unique core&#8208;shell interfacial bonding structure and donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structure, resulting in the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic.







Abstract
The composition of protection monolayer exerts great influence on the molecular and electronic structures of atomically precise monolayer protected metal nanoclusters. Four isostructural Ag/cyanurate/phosphine metallamacrocyclic monolayer protected Ag22 nanoclusters are synthesized by kinetically controlled in&#8208;situ ligand formation&#8208;driven strategy. These eight&#8208;electron superatomic silver nanoclusters feature an unprecedented interfacial bonding structure with diverse E&#8208;Ag (E=O/N/P/Ag) interactions between the Ag13 core and metallamacrocyclic monolayer, and displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), benefiting from their distinct donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structures. This work not only unmasks a new core&#8208;shell interface involving cyanurate ligand but also underlines the significance of high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity N&#8208;heterocyclic ligand in synthesizing TADF metal nanoclusters. This is the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with TADF characteristic.

         <title>Modulating the Rise and Decay Dynamics of Upconversion Luminescence through Controlling Excitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the extensively investigated steady&#8208;state upconversion luminescence (UCL), systematic studies on temporal UCL are carried out, which have enabled ever&#8208;wide modulation of the rise and decay dynamics of the UCL, and consequently a record adjustment of 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, as well as reversibly definable Er3+ emission color by simply tuning the pulse width of the excitation laser.







Abstract
Different from organic dye/quantum dot possessing one luminescent center, upconversion luminescence (UCL) is actually a statistic of temporal behaviors of countless individual activators. Our experimental results have shown that the rise and decay dynamics of UCL is directly associated with the relative contribution of sensitizer&#8208;to&#8208;activator energy transfer and energy migration among sensitizers, which can be physically modulated by simply tuning the excitation laser. Therefore, dynamic UCL with record&#8208;wide 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, and reversibly definable emission color is easily realized by just modulating the excitation laser. Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest&#8208;possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core&#8211;shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.

Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest-possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core&#8211;shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bacterial Avenalumic Acid Biosynthesis Includes Substitution of an Aromatic Amino Group for Hydride by Nitrous Acid Dependent Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is highly reactive and provides biological activity to natural products. By genome mining of the diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes, an avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77. This pathway includes two enzymes, AvaA6 and AvaA7, catalyzing the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively.







Abstract
The diazo group is an important functional group that can confer biological activity to natural products owing to its high reactivity. Recent studies have revealed that diazo groups are synthesized from amino groups using nitrous acid in secondary metabolites of actinomycetes. However, genome database analysis indicated that there are still many diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes for unknown biosynthetic pathways. Here, we discovered an avenalumic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77 by genome mining of enzymes involved in diazo group formation. Through heterologous expression, the gene cluster was revealed to direct avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthesis via 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;AAA). In vitro enzyme assays showed that AvaA6 and AvaA7 catalyzed the diazotization of 3&#8208;AAA using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively. This study revealed an unprecedented pathway for amino group removal via diazotization.

         <title>High&#8208;Areal Density Single&#8208;Atoms/Metal Oxide Nanosheets: A Micro&#8208;Gas Blasting Synthesis and Superior Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and a general micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) synthesis is developed to access versatile high&#8208;areal density noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Pt1/CeO2, Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. The as&#8208;prepared Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance than routinely structured alternatives by using water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) as a model reaction.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets are conducive to not only endow opened surfaces for loading active metal atoms but also boost the mass transfer for the heterogeneous reactions. The challenge is how to load and stabilize single&#8208;atoms on nanosheets in high&#8208;areal densities. This work reports an efficient micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) strategy to access versatile noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. Especially for Pt/CeO2 nanosheets (Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S), the Pt loading is increased to 15&#8197;at%. The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts from MGB are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance in the model reaction of water&#8208;gas shift (WGS). The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalyst exhibit 2&#8211;3&#8197;times reactivity that of their thicker counterpart, single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 microspheric catalyst. Moreover, the single&#8208;atom sites in Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S (1&#8211;10&#8201;%) catalysts are stable in a harsh WGS reaction condition of 10&#8201;% CO. This work thus paves a way to access the practical single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Exploring the Gas&#8208;Phase Formation and Chemical Reactivity of Highly Reduced M8L6 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination cages containing porphyrin subunits are reduced up to fourteen times in the gas phase. While the presence or absence of Nickel(II) coordinated in the porphyrin binding site does not affect the rate of reduction, the reactivity of the reduced species toward molecular O2 is significantly enhanced in the former case. Additionally, the presence of a C60 fullerene guest within the nickelated cage reduces its reactivity.







Abstract
Coordination cages with well&#8208;defined cavities show great promise in the field of catalysis on account of their unique combination of molecular confinement effects and transition&#8208;metal redox chemistry. Here, three coordination cages are reduced from their native 16+ oxidation state to the 2+ state in the gas phase without observable structural degradation. Using this method, the reaction rate constants for each reduction step were determined, with no noticeable differences arising following either the incorporation of a C60&#8208;fullerene guest or alteration of the cage chemical structure. The reactivity of highly reduced cage species toward molecular oxygen is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; after a threshold number of reduction steps, which is influenced by guest molecules and the structure of cage components. These new experimental approaches provide a unique window to explore the chemistry of highly&#8208;reduced cage species that can be modulated by altering their structures and encapsulated guest species.

         <title>A Library of Rare Earth Oxide Ultrathin Nanowires with Polymer&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile colloidal method to synthesize ultrathin nanowires at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) is developed. The mechanism of nanocrystal growth along different dimensions is discussed. Fifteen kinds of RE&#8208;Mo&#8208;O (RE=Y, La&#8208;Nd, and Sm&#8208;Lu) ultrathin nanowires could be synthesized using this method. All of them exhibited polymer&#8208;like behavior.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanowires (NWs) have always attracted the attention of researchers due to their unique properties, but their facile synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein we developed a general method for the synthesis of rare earth (RE) oxide ultrathin NWs at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C). The formation mechanism of ultrathin NWs lies in two aspects: thermodynamic advantage of one dimensional (1D) growth at low temperature, and supplement of effective monomers. As an extension, fifteen kinds of RE oxide ultrathin NWs were synthesized through this strategy, and they all exhibited polymer&#8208;like behaviors. Meanwhile, the high viscosity, organic gel, wet&#8208; and electro&#8208;spinning of Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O NWs were studied in detail, demonstrating the similarity of ultrathin inorganic NWs to polymers. In addition, the Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O ultrathin NWs were used as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation and showed excellent performance with toluene conversion ratio of 83.8&#8201;%, suggesting their potential application in organic photocatalysis.

The mechanism of nanocrystal growth along different dimensions is discussed. Fifteen kinds of RE-Mo-O (RE=Y, La-Nd, and Sm-Lu) ultrathin nanowires could be synthesized using this method. All of them exhibited polymer-like behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin nanowires (NWs) have always attracted the attention of researchers due to their unique properties, but their facile synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein we developed a general method for the synthesis of rare earth (RE) oxide ultrathin NWs at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C). The formation mechanism of ultrathin NWs lies in two aspects: thermodynamic advantage of one dimensional (1D) growth at low temperature, and supplement of effective monomers. As an extension, fifteen kinds of RE oxide ultrathin NWs were synthesized through this strategy, and they all exhibited polymer-like behaviors. Meanwhile, the high viscosity, organic gel, wet- and electro-spinning of Ce-Mo-O NWs were studied in detail, demonstrating the similarity of ultrathin inorganic NWs to polymers. In addition, the Ce-Mo-O ultrathin NWs were used as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation and showed excellent performance with toluene conversion ratio of 83.8&#8201;%, suggesting their potential application in organic photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Exposed Single&#8208;Ni Atoms with Potential&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behaviors for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced electrocatalyst has been developed by decorating single&#8208;Ni atoms on hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS) for the oxygen evolution reaction. Thanks to the abundantly surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;Ni atoms, hollow S/N&#8208;codoped carbon matrix, as well as their strong synergistic interactions, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Trapping the active sites on the exterior surface of hollow supports can reduce mass transfer resistance and enhance atomic utilization. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize single&#8208;Ni atoms decorated hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS). Specifically, the CdS@3&#8208;aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N&#8208;FCS. The gas&#8208;migrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N&#8208;FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 56.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and ultra&#8208;long stability up to 166&#8197;hours without obvious fading. Moreover, the potential&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of Ni&#8208;N4 sites and the contribution of the S dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography: A New Paradigm for Versatility in Simultaneous Multicomponent Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid separation technique, referred to as Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), enabling simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range is introduced. DGUC lays the foundation for the next generation of hybrid chromatographic techniques with the deployment of universal elution profiles obtained via multi&#8208;eluent blending beyond traditional separation modes.







Abstract
Generality in analytical chemistry can be manifested in impactful platforms that can streamline modern organic synthesis and biopharmaceutical processes. We herein introduce a hybrid separation technique named Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), which is built upon an automated dynamic modulation of CO2, organic modifier, and water blends with various buffers. This concept enables simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range in single experimental runs. After a careful investigation of its fundamental aspects, a DGUC&#8208;DAD&#8208;MS screening workflow that combines multiple orthogonal column and mobile phase choices across a far&#8208;reaching universal elution profile is also reported. The power of this framework is demonstrated with new analytical applications guiding academic and industrial laboratories in the development of new (bio)pharmaceutical targets (e.g. synthetic intermediates, nucleosides, cyclic and linear peptides, proteins, antibody drug conjugates).

         <title>Realizing zT&gt;2 in Environment&#8208;Friendly Monoclinic Cu2S&#8212;Tetragonal Cu1.96S Nano&#8208;Phase Junctions for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled phase junction nanocomposites are prepared by a novel surface ligand (decanethiol)&#8208;directed strategy. The conductivity is increased by modulation doping, and the phase boundary enhances phonon scattering, which helps to reduce lattice thermal conductivity. The combined effects yield a record&#8208;high zT=2.1 in metal sulfide thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites, made of nanograins with the same composition but different phases, offer a platform to optimize the physiochemical performance of materials. Herein, we demonstrate a straightforward strategy to synthesize Cu2&#8722;xS phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites by retaining surface 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands, in contrast to the traditional method that strips the ligands. As a result, phase junctions between a conventional monoclinic (m) phase and an unconventional metastable tetragonal (t) phase are obtained. The significantly improved power factor is obtained due to the doping of the t&#8208;phase. The phase&#8208;junction interfaces reduce thermal conductivity. Finally, surface regulation of phase junctions pushes the peak zT to 2.1 at 932&#8197;K, being the highest reported for environment&#8208;friendly metal sulfides. This work provides a paradigm to optimize thermoelectric performance by controlling phase junctions through surface&#8208;ligand tuning.

         <title>Conformational Effects on the Threading Kinetics of Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped Guests into the Cavity of Oxatub[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex kinetic behavior was observed in a two&#8208;component system containing a viologen&#8208;based guest and oxatub[4]arene through the involvement of the three conformers of the host. In addition, an unprecedented threading mechanism involving the tilted conformation of the guests was revealed to be responsible for the very fast kinetics and for the threading of guests with very large stoppers.







Abstract
Unprecedented threading kinetics were revealed between viologen&#8208;based guests and conformationally adaptive oxatub[4]arene. Three representative conformations of oxatub[4]arene are involved in the kinetic and thermodynamic products which follow the opposite orders in their rankings. Consequently, error correction was involved and a complex kinetic process was observed in a simple two&#8208;component system. Moreover, it was found that some viologen&#8208;based guests have much faster threading kinetics than those of DABCO&#8208;based with the same stoppers. This was enabled by an unprecedented threading mechanism in which a tilted conformation of the guests is adopted by involving one linear alkyl group on the 3,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzyl stoppers, the viologen core, and the methylene spacers in the transition states. This new mechanism even allows the viologen&#8208;based guests with the 3,5&#8208;dicetyloxybenzyl stoppers to form a pseudorotaxane with oxatub[4]arene.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Phase Separation Behavior and Pathway&#8208;Directed Information Exchange in all&#8208;DNA Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage mechanism is discovered in the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation pathways of ssDNA to form all&#8208;DNA coacervates. Distinct ion&#8208;specific pathways allow the generation of new coacervate structures by mixing multiple coacervate systems, leading to pathway&#8208;controlled coacervate&#8208;protocell communication and information exchange.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation provides a versatile approach to fabricating cell&#8208;mimicking coacervates. Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a straightforward formation of all&#8208;DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth process. Ca2+ allows for irreversible, whereas Mg2+ leads to reversible phase separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the information transfer of one&#8208;component DNA droplets and two&#8208;component core&#8211;shell protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA that lead to new phenomena in cell&#8208;mimicking systems.

Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the metal-dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a straightforward formation of all-DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth process. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; allows for &lt;i&gt;irreversible&lt;/i&gt;, whereas Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leads to &lt;i&gt;reversible&lt;/i&gt; phase separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the information transfer of one-component DNA droplets and two-component core&#8211;shell protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA that lead to new phenomena in cell-mimicking systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of a XeIV Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4</title>

Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 react in CFCl3 solvent to form the first transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4. The complex was structurally characterized by Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, such as MEPS, show the W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond is primarily an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a smaller degree of covalent character.







Abstract
The coordination complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4, was synthesized in CFCl3 solvent by reaction of the weak fluoride&#8208;ion donor and strong oxidative fluorinating agent, XeF4, with the moderate&#8208;strength fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor, WOF4. The compound is the only transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV and was characterized at low temperatures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 coordinate trans to the W=O bond through a W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond. The XeF3 moiety of F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4 acquires a degree of [XeF3]+ character upon coordination that is reflected by its Xe&#8722;F stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF4 and [XeF3]+. Calculations show W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W angle. The calculations show F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 (M=Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MoOF4.

         <title>Sequential and Reversible Phase Transformations in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Sb&#8208;based Halides towards Multiple Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides have drawn increasing attention due to the attractive structure dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Here, we report two new 0D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid Sb&#8208;based halides, (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#183;H2O (MTP = Methyltriphenylphosphonium, crystal 1) and (MTP)2SbBr5 (crystal 2), featuring a reversible structural phase transformation and tunable orange and red emissions upon dehydration and rehydration of H2O molecules. Intriguingly, a subsequent heat treatment further enables the formation of glassy state (MTP)2SbBr5 (glass 3) with near&#8208;infrared luminescence, moreover, a sequential reverse phase transformation from glass 3 to crystal 2 and 1 is triggered by acetonitrile and water vapor stepwise. The anti&#8208;counterfeiting demo based on the tunable and reversible PL switching is finally achieved and thus the phase structure engineering in 0D metal halides expands their multiple applications in optical fields.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dislocated Twin&#8208;Locking Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Configuration for Efficient Delayed Fluorescence with Multiple Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states are advantageous for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), while the realization of multiple TSCT systems remains challenging. Herein, a rigid molecule with three&#8208;dimensional dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor configuration has been developed by linking bi&#8208;phenazines (2PXZ) donor and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor via twin&#8208;locking of two spiro&#8208;fluorene bridges. The twin&#8208;locking construction with multiple TSCT effects suppresses the intramolecular rotations of various segments in 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ, leading to a&#160;small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference, fast reverse intersystem crossing process, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This material simultaneously possesses the capabilities of TADF and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The device employing 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ as dopant displays an optimal external quantum efficiency of 27.1% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Construction of Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives by Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the synthesis of &#945; &#8209; tertiary amino acids (ATAAs) has been extensively studied, the development of an inexpensive and facile methodology to incorporate multifunctionality on ATAAs remains challenging. In this article, we present a single&#8208;step radical approach for the modular synthesis of functionally diverse ATAAs. This synthesis takes place under mild conditions with an absence of metals, photocatalysts, and all other additives. We demonstrate the broad applications of this approach on a variety of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, alkenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and oxazolones. The results prove that our method provides excellent functional group tolerance and late&#8208;stage applicability, as well as gram&#8208;scale synthesis via flow chemistry. Additionally, we include mechanistic studies which reveal that the excited state of oxazolone enolate upon light excitation is a key intermediate that acts as a radical precursor and an efficient reductant.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Laboratory&#8208;based Multi&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Near&#8208;Edge Spectroscopy of Solid Catalysts</title>

         <title>Glycan Modulation of Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor&#8208;1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays critical roles in cancer. Microarray, computational, thermodynamic, and cellular imaging studies reveal that activation of IGF&#8208;1R by its cognate ligand IGF&#8208;1 is inhibited by shorter, soluble heparan sulfate (HS) sequences (e.g., HS06), whereas longer polymeric chains do not inhibit the RTK, a phenomenon directly opposed to the traditional relationship known for GAG&#8211;protein systems. The inhibition arises from smaller oligosaccharides binding in a unique pocket in the IGF&#8208;1R ectodomain, which competes with the natural cognate ligand IGF1. This work presents a highly interesting observation on preferential and competing inhibition of IGF&#8208;1R by smaller sequences, whereas polysaccharides are devoid of this function. These insights will be of major value to glycobiologists and anti&#8208;cancer drug discoverers.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirosilabicyclohexenes by Asymmetric Dual Ring Expansion of Spirosilabicyclobutane with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral spiranes   are pivotal ring systems widely found in natural products, pharmaceutics, materials, and ligands. However, the asymmetric synthesis of their silaspirane counterparts has rarely been reported. Silaspiranes have attracted particular attention due to their chiral spiro&#8208;silicon center, which serves as an ideal carbon isostere and can endow spiro&#8208;analogs with distinct properties. Distinct from previously reported cyclization or cycloaddition strategies to form 5/5&#8208;silaspiranes, we report herein the asymmetric dual ring expansion of spirosilabicyclobutanes with alkynes to synthesize axially chiral spirosilabicyclohexenes bearing a novel 6/6&#8208;silaspirane framework. DFT (density functional theory) calculations provide the deep insight into the origin of the high enantioselectivity controlled by the sterically demanding binaphthyl phosphoramidite ligand. Preliminary studies of chiroptical properties indicate that one of the spirosilabicyclohexene analogs exhibit fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) activity.</dc:description>

In this work, porous phenolic pillar[5]arene crystals were used as a reaction space to promote and perturb equilibrium between lactones and their corresponding polyesters. Immersion of porous pillar[5]arene crystals in liquid lactones induced ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone at room temperature because the phenolic hydroxy groups have catalytic activity  via  hydrogen bonds and the pillar[5]arene cavities prefer linear guests.

         <title>Transient Stabilization Effect of CO2 in the Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Azo Compounds and the Reductive Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and utilization has attracted a great attention in organic synthesis. Herein, an unpresented transient stabilization effect (TSE) of CO2  is disclosed and well applied to the electrochemical hydrogenation of azo compounds to hydrazine derivatives. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies imply that CO2  can capture azo radical anion intermediates to protect the hydrogenation from potential degradation reactions, and is finally released through decarboxylation. The promotion effect of CO2  was further demonstrated to work in the preliminary study of electrochemical reductive coupling of &#945;&#8208;ketoesters to vicinal diol derivatives. For the electrochemical reductive reactions mentioned above, CO2  is indispensable. The presented results shed light on a different usage of CO2  and could inspire novel experimental design by using CO2  as a transient protecting group.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Ethane/Ethylene Separation by MOFs through the Amino&#8208;Functionalization of Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption technology based on ethane&#8208;selective materials is a promising alternative to energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation for separating ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). We employed pore engineering strategy to tune pore environment of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) through organic functional groups and boosted the C2H6/C2H4 separation of MOF. Introduction of amino (&#8208;NH2) groups into Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76 not only decreased pore sizes but also facilitated multiple guest&#8208;host interactions in confined pores. The NH2&#8208;functionalized Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has increased C2H6 and C2H4 uptakes and&#160;C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76(NH2) has significantly improved one&#8208;step separation performance for &#160;C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a high C2H4 (&gt;99.95%) productivity of 17.66 L kg&#8208;1 compared to 7.53 L kg&#8208;1 by Tb&#8208;MOF&#8208;76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accissible &#8208;NH2 groups on pore surfaces.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adsorption technology based on ethane-selective materials is a promising alternative to energy-intensive cryogenic distillation for separating ethane (C2H6) and ethylene (C2H4). We employed pore engineering strategy to tune pore environment of metal-organic framework (MOF) through organic functional groups and boosted the C2H6/C2H4 separation of MOF. Introduction of amino (-NH2) groups into Tb-MOF-76 not only decreased pore sizes but also facilitated multiple guest-host interactions in confined pores. The NH2-functionalized Tb-MOF-76(NH2) has increased C2H6 and C2H4 uptakes and&#160;C2H6/C2H4 selectivity. The results of experimental and simulated transient breakthroughs reveal that Tb-MOF-76(NH2) has significantly improved one-step separation performance for &#160;C2H6/C2H4 mixtures with a high C2H4 (&amp;gt;99.95%) productivity of 17.66 L kg-1 compared to 7.53 L kg-1 by Tb-MOF-76, resulting from the suitable pore confinement and accissible -NH2 groups on pore surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Direct strategy to achieve &#945;&#8208;acylated difunctionalization of alkenes is attractive for complex ketone synthesis.

         <title>A Missing Link in Multisubstituted Pyrrolidines: Remote Stereocontrol Forged by Rhodium&#8208;Alkyl Nitrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrrolidines are significant N&#8208;heterocycles in medicinal chemistry and are among the top ten ring systems found in drug molecules. While simple derivatives are commercially available, densely decorated derivatives with precise stereochemical arrangements remain difficult to obtain. Methods for synthesizing multisubstituted pyrrolidines with nonadjacent stereocenters are particularly scarce. To bridge this gap, we report the stereoselective synthesis of remotely decorated, trisubstituted &#946;&#8208;prolines via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amination. The transformation proceeds well in the presence of various functionalities with exclusive  anti  &#8208;selectivity. Carboxylic acids in the products serve as gateways for diverse downstream transformations. Furthermore, the combined experimental and computational study sheds lights on the origin of high diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp  2  edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4 &#197; was observed, resulting in high H  2  /CO  2  separation (H  2  permeance: 5.2 &#215; 10  &#8722;6  mol/m  2  &#183;Pa&#183;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H  2  production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H  2  /CO  2  /CH  4  . The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optoelectronic applications of clusters emerged rapidly. Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes (CLED) as representative hold promise as a new generation of displays and lightings. However, as one of the main challenges in electroluminescence (EL) field, until present, no deep&#8208;blue CLEDs were reported, due to the strict requirements on excited&#8208;state characteristics of clusters. Herein, two phosphine&#8208;stabilized Au3 triangle and Au3Ag pyramid named [O(Audppy)3]BF4 and [O(Audppy)3Ag](BF4)2 were chosen to demonstrate efficient deep&#8208;blue CLEDs. The ligand&#8208;incorporated charge transfer transitions of the clusters contribute to both singlet and triplet excited states of the clusters, giving rise to phosphorescence at 460 nm and EL emissions at 436 nm. Based on device engineering, the maximum luminescence beyond 8000 nits and the chromatic coordinates with y &lt; 0.1 in deep&#8208;blue region verify the competence of CLEDs for high&#8208;resolution displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Aryl&#8208;Alkene Axis by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkene skeletons via classic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reaction has been challenging compared to the biaryls. Rational optimization established an enabling 3,3&#8242;&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand for asymmetric coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under mild conditions, affording the acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes in good yield, atroposelectivity and E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
The application of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction to forge the atropisomeric biaryls has seen remarkable progress but exploration of this chemistry to directly forge chiral C(aryl)&#8208;C(alkene) axis is underdeveloped. The replacement of arene substrates by alkenes intensifies the challenges in terms of reactivity, configurational atropostability of product and selectivity control. By meticulous ligand design and fine&#8208;tuning of reaction parameters, we identified a highly active 3,3&#8242;&#8208;triphenylsilyl&#8208;substituted phosphite ligand to realize arene&#8208;alkene Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of hindered aryl halides and vinyl boronates under very mild conditions. The axially chiral acyclic aryl&#8208;alkenes were generated in commendable efficiency, enantioselectivity and E/Z selectivity.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage Carboranes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carbazole&#8208;modified carboranes emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) were investigated. The |gPL| factors of (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in films reached 7.38&#215;10&#8722;3. Significant solvation effect was observed in the fluorescence and CPL of Cb1, while Cb2 showed remarkable AIECL effect with excellent ECL stability and dopamine detection ability.







Abstract
Herein, we report the structures of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage carborane derivatives bearing carbazole chromophores that emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL). By adjusting the substituent positions on the carborane derivatives, two chiral luminescent molecules, Cb1 and Cb2, with different properties were obtained. The photoluminescence dissymmetry factors |gPL| of both (R/S)&#8208;Cb1 and (R/S)&#8208;Cb2 enantiomers in neat films were as high as 6.24&#215;10&#8722;3 and 7.38&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively. Cb1 showed a deep blue emission peak at 434&#8197;nm in n&#8208;pentane. Interestingly, distinct fluorescence and CPL spectra were observed in solvents of different polarities due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect, suggesting its potential use in solvent recognition. Meanwhile, Cb2 exhibited good AIECL property, excellent ECL stability and could be used for determining dopamine concentrations, suggesting its potential applications in biology and diagnosis.

         <dc:description>Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of  anti  &#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide B (C9&#8208;C15) and leucascandrolide A (C9&#8208;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of pyroelectric crystals decoupled from piezoelectricity is not only a topic of scientific curiosity but also demonstrates effects in principle that have the potential to be technologically advantageous. Here we report a new method for the design of such materials. Thus, the co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals with tailor&#8208;made guest molecules, as illustrated by the doping of &#945;&#8208;glycine with different amino acids (Threonine, Alanine and Serine). The polarization of those crystals displays two distinct contributions, one arising from the difference in dipole moments between guest and host and the other from the displacement of host molecules from their symmetry&#8208;related positions. These contributions exhibit different temperature dependences and response to mechanical deformation. Thus, providing a  proof of concept  for the ability to design pyroelectric materials with reduced piezoelectric coefficient (d  22  ) to a minimal value, below the resolution limit of the method (&lt;0.005 pm/V)</dc:description>

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion "fragments" of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8211;m&#8208;O&#8211;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor "fragments" as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>PNP Ligands in Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Activation and Functionalization of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal mediated white phosphorus activation is of high interest as an ecological alternative to P  4&#160;  chlorination pathway to the practically useful phosphorus products. Herein, we report a facile approach for P  4&#160;  activation, transformation and subsequent functionalization using cobalt complexes bearing PNP ligands. The use of  N,N  &#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)amine as a ligand allows one to transform P  4&#160;  tetrahedron into a  zig&#8208;zag  chain with the formation of complex [Co(Ph  2  PNHP(Ph  2  )  PPPP  P(Ph  2  )NHPPh  2  )]BF  4  (  4  ). The presence of organic substituent at nitrogen atom in PNP ligand enables one to obtain complexes with &#951;  1  &#8208;coordinated P  4  molecule, which indicates the crucial role of N&#8208;H bond in transformation of white phosphorus tetrahedron. Additionally, complex  4&#160;  can readily be functionalized by means of the reaction with Ph  2  PCl leading to the formation of a new complex bearing unique P  9  &#8208;ligand. The obtained results provide opportunities for facile construction of new polyphosphorus ligands in the coordination sphere of transition metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY) powder with in situ formed CuO nanoparticles, as reported by Mohamed Nawfal Ghazzal, Li&#8208;Zhu Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210242). The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated an excellent co&#8208;catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. The work will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.

         <title>Organogold(III) Complexes Display Conditional Photoactivities: Evolving From Photodynamic into Photoactivated Chemotherapy in Response to O2 Consumption for Robust Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;reactivity for robust tumor therapy: A PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photo&#8208;reactivity with response to oxygen&#8208;consumption was found in cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes, leading to potent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, strong anti&#8208;angiogenesis in zebrafish, and efficient suppression of mouse tumor xenografts.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a spatiotemporally controllable, powerful approach in combating cancers but suffers from low activity under hypoxia, whereas photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) operates in an O2&#8208;independent manner but compromises the ability to harness O2 for potent photosensitization. Herein we report that cyclometalated gold(III)&#8208;alkyne complexes display a PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT evolving photoactivity for efficient cancer treatment. On the one hand, the gold(III) complexes can act as dual photosensitizers and substrates, leading to conditional PDT activity in oxygenated condition that progresses to highly efficient PACT (&#981; up to 0.63) when O2 is depleted in solution and under cellular environment. On the other hand, the conditional PDT&#8208;to&#8208;PACT reactivity can be triggered by external photosensitizers in a similar manner in vitro and in vivo, giving additional tumor&#8208;selectivity and/or deep tissue penetration by red&#8208;light irradiation that leads to robust anticancer efficacy.

         <title>Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenyl Imide with Mono&#8208;, or Disubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of allenyl imide and alkenes was achieved by utilizing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide&#8208;magnesium(II) complex as the catalyst. This protocol provided a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A stepwise mechanism was proposed based on experimental studies and DFT calculations and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction was crucial for the enantioselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric [2+2] cycloaddition of allenyl imide and mono&#8208; or disubstituted alkenes is disclosed. The key feature of this method is the use of bidentate allenyl imide and weakly activated and less steric hindered alkene pair by utilizing chiral magnesium(II) complex of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide, which could provide through&#8208;space dispersion interactions to orientate the arrangement of the alkene. This protocol allows the generation of a series of axially chiral cyclobutenes and four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing spirocycles (80 examples) in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active molecules as well. Experimental studies and DFT calculations revealed that this [2+2] cycloaddition proceeded via a stepwise mechanism involving a short&#8208;lived zwitterionic intermediate. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the alkenes and the amide moiety in the ligand was crucial for the enantiocontrol.

         <title>Catalytic and Stereoselective Transformations with Easily Accessible and Purchasable Allyl and Alkenyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes recent advances regarding the preparation of complex and stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules by routes originating from purchasable or readily accessible alkenyl and allylic fluorides. The untapped potential of other, far less explored, commercially available organofluorine compounds as launching points for the development of stereoselective processes that may be valuable to drug discovery is underscored.







Abstract
Stereochemically defined organofluorine compounds are vital to drug discovery and many applicable catalytic strategies have been introduced for accessing these entities stereoselectively. One approach entails incorporation of a fluorine atom (C&#8722;F bond formation) or an organofluorine moiety (e.g., CF3 or CF2H), and another exploits commercially available compounds with one or more fluorine atoms. Here, we present the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regarding the use of alkenyl and allylic fluorides in preparation of stereochemically defined fluoro&#8208;organic molecules. Allylic and alkenyl fluorides may be purchased or generated from a commercially available acid, carboxylate salt, ester, aldehyde hydrate, or ketone bearing several fluorine atoms next to a carbonyl group. We underscore the untapped potential of purchasable organofluorine compounds, many allylic and alkenyl fluorides, as launching points for development of stereoselective processes that are of value to therapeutic science.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Assisted Charge Transport through Positively Charged Dimer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimer single&#8208;molecule junction with positively charged units is constructed through host&#8211;guest interaction using graphene&#8208;based static molecular junctions. A transition mechanism from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport is observed, which is caused by thermally&#8208;induced specific molecular vibration modes. The introduction of positive charge can improve the incoherent transport process.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport plays a vital role in the fields of electronics, as well as biochemical systems. Here, we design supramolecular dimer junctions and investigate the effects of charge state and energy level alignment on charge transport under nanoconfinement. Incoherent tunneling caused by thermally&#8208;induced vibrations is enhanced in positively charged systems. The transition between coherent and incoherent tunneling is associated with specific molecular vibration modes. Positively charged systems with smaller torsional barriers and vibrational frequencies result in lower transition temperatures. Multiple thermal effects have a great impact on the conductance in the off&#8208;resonant tunneling, while thermally&#8208;induced vibron&#8208;assisted tunneling contributes more to the transport in the resonant tunneling. These investigations offer a deep mechanism understanding of intermolecular charge transport and facilitate the development of practical functional molecular devices.

         <title>Human Cyclophilin B Nuclease Activity Revealed via Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Electrochemical Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs electrochemical DNA&#8208;based sensors to investigate the hydrolytic activity of a previously unknown nuclease, cyclophilin B. The protein is secreted by pancreatic cancer cells and could be a biomarker for early&#8208;stage cancer diagnoses. However, the demonstrated nuclease activity will limit bioassay development based on natural nucleic acid aptamers. Instead, we propose DNA stereoisomers (l&#8208;DNA) to overcome this challenge.







Abstract
Human cyclophilin B (CypB) is oversecreted by pancreatic cancer cells, making it a potential biomarker for early&#8208;stage disease diagnosis. Our group is motivated to develop aptamer&#8208;based assays to measure CypB levels in biofluids. However, human cyclophilins have been postulated to have collateral nuclease activity, which could impede the use of aptamers for CypB detection. To establish if CypB can hydrolyze electrode&#8208;bound nucleic acids, we used ultrasensitive electrochemical sensors to measure CypB's hydrolytic activity. Our sensors use ssDNA and dsDNA in the biologically predominant d&#8208;DNA form, and in the nuclease resistant l&#8208;DNA form. Challenging such sensors with CypB and control proteins, we unequivocally demonstrate that CypB can cleave nucleic acids. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use electrochemical biosensors to reveal the hydrolytic activity of a protein that is not known to be a nuclease. Future development of CypB bioassays will require the use of nuclease&#8208;resistant aptamer sequences.

         <dc:description>
The precise co&#8208;conformation regulation of topologically chiral [2]catenanes under two different external stimuli led to the construction of a bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch, as reported by Xiao He, Wei Wang and Hai&#8208;Bo Yang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210542). The results provide not only an attractive approach toward the construction of multistate CPL switches for practical uses but also a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

         <title>An&#160;Ultraviolet Fluorophore with Narrowed Emission via Coplanar Molecular Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emitting fluorophores exhibit immense potentials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, it&#8217;s still hard to simultaneously realize short&#8208;wavelength ultraviolet (UV) or near ultraviolet emission (NUV) while maintaining a narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) value, and rare work focus on such challenging pursuit. Herein, an ingenious synthetic method was devised to achieve emitters with coplanar structure. 11&#8208;(4,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)indolo[3,2,1&#8208;  jk  ]carbazole (ICZ&#8208;TAZ) was designed to realize narrowed UV emission both in photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) which benefited from the suppression of vibronic coupling. UV/NUV OLEDs based on ICZ&#8208;TAZ achieve external quantum efficiency (EQE) maximums of 3.26% peaks @ 388 nm and 4.02 % peaks @ 406 nm with small FWHM of 32 nm and 46 nm, respectively, corresponding with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off at luminance of 100 cd m  &#8208;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analyzed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru atoms causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganization can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalization of surfaces with carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in the Detachment of Mass&#8208;Selected Chiral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD) is a forward&#8208;backward asymmetry in the photoemission from a non&#8208;racemic sample induced by circularly polarized light. PECD spectroscopy has potential analytical advantages for chiral discrimination over other chiroptical methods due to its increased sensitivity to the chiral potential of the molecule. The use of anions for PECD spectroscopy allows for mass&#8208;selectivity and provides a path to simple experimental schemes that employ table&#8208;top light sources. Evidence of PECD for anions is limited, and insight into the forces that govern PECD electron dynamics in photodetachment is absent. Here, we demonstrate a PECD effect in the photodetachment of mass&#8208;selected deprotonated 1&#8208;indanol anions. By utilizing velocity map imaging photoelectron spectroscopy with a tunable light source, we determine the energy&#8208;resolved PECD over a wide range of photon energies. The observed PECD reaches up to 11%, similar to what has been measured for neutral species.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Biocatalytic N&#8208;Methylation of Unsaturated Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for regioselective&#160;N&#8208;methylation and &#8208;alkylation of unsaturated heterocycles with &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; reagents are highly sought&#8208;after. This reaction could drastically simplify synthesis of privileged bioactive molecules. Here we report engineered and natural methyltransferases for challenging&#160;N&#8208;(m)ethylation of heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, benzotriazoles, imidazoles and indazoles. The reactions are performed through a cyclic enzyme cascade that consists of two methyltransferases using only iodoalkanes or methyl tosylate as simple reagents. This method enables the selective synthesis of important molecules that are otherwise difficult to access, proceeds with high regioselectivity (r.r. up to &gt;99%), yield (up to 99%), on a preparative scale, and with nearly equimolar concentration of simple starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Hydrogen Production Coupled with Electrochemical Oxidation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxidation of small molecules to generate value&#8208;added products has gained enormous interest in recent years due to the advantages of benign operation conditions, high conversion efficiency and selectivity, the absence of external oxidizing agents, and eco&#8208;friendly. Moreover, small molecule oxidation reactions can serve as promising substitutes to replace the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, such as hydrogen production and CO2 reduction. Coupling electrochemical oxidation of small molecules at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode in an electrolyser would simultaneously realize high value chemicals generation or pollutant degradation and high&#8208;efficient hydrogen production. In recent years, various thermodynamically more favorable small molecules oxidation reactions have been designed as promising alternatives to OER to achieve highly efficient hydrogen production. In this Minireview, we present a brief introduction about small molecule choice and design strategies of electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we highlight the discussion about recent breakthroughs in small molecule oxidation assisted highly efficient hydrogen production, including alternative molecules, modulated strategies of catalysts, and related catalytic reaction mechanisms in small molecule oxidation reactions. Finally, a perspective on possible challenges and future orientations of small molecule oxidation is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetrically substituted 10H,10'H&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobi[acridine] derivatives as hole&#8208;transporting materials for perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) based on the 10  H  , 10'H&#8208;9,9'&#8208;spirobi [acridine] core (  BSA50  and  BSA51  ) were synthesized, and their electronic and hole transportation properties were explored. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the presence of rigid 3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in  BSA 50  brings about improved hole mobility, and higher work function (lower HOMO level) compared to bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amine units in  BSA51  , which increase interfacial hole transportation from the perovskite to the HTM. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on  BSA50  exhibit higher  V  oc  and FF than those with  BSA51  , boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 22.65%, which is close to the value obtained in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based devices (23.37%). Owing to the higher hydrophobicity of  BSA50  and its effective defect passivation, unencapsulated PSCs exhibit superior stability to devices employing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, retaining nearly 90% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h operation output. A perovskite solar module using  BSA50  HTM exhibits a PCE of 21.35% (6.5 &#215; 7 cm) with a  J  sc  of 3.08 mA cm  &#8208;2  ,  V  oc  of 8.761 V and FF of 79.1%. This work demonstrates the high potential of molecularly engineered spirobi[acridine] derivatives as HTMs as replacements of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interaction on Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the simultaneous presence of two metal active centres, some special interactions occur between active sites in diatomic catalysts (DACs). Such interactions play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of the reaction, denoted as long&#8208;range interaction (LRI). The right combination must be screened and clarified to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, the LRI has not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism and electrocatalytic applications of LRI are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRI on DACs are proposed to present an overall view and reference for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Sequence Space of Radical&#160;S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine&#8208;Dependent Enzymes Involved in Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) represent one of the largest but primarily underexplored natural product families in bacteria. The genetically encoded nature of RiPPs simplifies the prediction and prioritization of their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). We report a small peptide and enzyme co&#8208;occurrence analysis workflow (SPECO), which allowed us to identify 32,220 prospective rSAM&#8208;catalyzed RiPP BGCs from 161,954 bacterial genomes and prioritize 25 families with new biosynthetic architectures or precursor patterns. We characterized three new enzymes that respectively catalyze cysteine&#8208;glycine (BlaB), histidine&#8208;aliphatic side chain (ScaB), and tyrosine/histidine&#8208;arginine (VguB) cross&#8208;links. The cyclophane&#8208;forming enzyme ScaB exhibits broad substrate selectivity, allowing it to catalyze diverse triceptide formation. These results demonstrate the strength of the SPECO workflow in discovering new enzymes for peptide macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sonication&#8208;Activated Valence&#8208;Variable Sono&#8208;Sensitizer/Catalyst for Autography Inhibition/Ferroptosis&#8208;Induced Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective deployment of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated oncotherapy in practice remains challenging, mired by uncontrollable catalytic processes, stern reaction conditions and safety concerns. Herein, we develop a copper nanodot integrating sonodynamic and catalytic effects within one active center, which responds to exogenous ultrasound (US) and endogenous H2O2 stimuli.&#160;US irradiation induces the valence conversion from Cu(II) to Cu(I) catalyzing H2O2 into &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, valence transformation results in electron&#8208;hole pairs separation, promoting ROS generation for sonodynamic therapy. Notably, copper nanodots not only block lysosome fusion and degradation leading to autophagy flux blockage, but also interfere with the glutathione peroxidase 4 and cystine&#8208;glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 function achieving ferroptosis. Furthermore, reversible valence changes, inherent hydrophilicity and renal clearance ultrasmall size guarantee biosafety.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Stable Anion&#8208;Tuned Electrode/Electrolyte Interphase on High&#8208;Voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 Cathode for Thermally&#8208;Modulated Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing stable electrode/electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics is vital for fast&#8208;charging batteries. Herein, we investigate the interphase that forms between a high&#8208;voltage Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and the electrolytes consisting of 3.0, 1.0, or 0.3 M NaClO4 in an organic carbonate solvent (47.5:47.5:5 mixture of EC: PC: FEC) during charging up to 4.5 V at 55oC. It is found that a higher anion/solvent ratio in electrolyte solvation structure induces anion&#8208;dominated interphase containing more inorganic species and more anion derivatives (CxClOy), which leads to a larger interfacial Na+ transport resistance and more unfavorable gas evolution. In comparison, a low anion/solvent ratio derives stable anion&#8208;tuned interphase that enables better interfacial kinetics and cycle ability. Importantly, the performance of a failed cathode is restored by triggering the decomposition of CxClOy species. This work elucidates the role of tuning interphase in fast&#8208;charging batteries.</dc:description>

We report the bi&#8208;polaron transport and magnetic field induced Pauli spin&#8208;blockade in solid&#8208;state molecular junctions (MJs) evidenced by a positive magnetoresistance (MR). The junction was made of thin layers of redox&#8208;active ruthenium polypyridyl&#8208;oligomers Ru(tpy)2 sandwiched between conducting amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) electrodes. The redox&#8208;active Ru(tpy)2 molecule, which enables small polaron and deep traps in the charge transport of the Ru(tpy)2 MJ as revealed by the temperature&#8208;dependent current&#8211;voltage response, leads to the formation of the bi&#8208;polaron and magnetic field induced Pauli spin blockade, resulting into the MR. At the meantime, the reliable and controllable device performance renders a rigid thickness&#8208;dependent MR evolution. The bi&#8208;polaron transport revealed in our study underscores the importance of the multi&#8208;particle transport by molecular design in MJs and laid the foundation for magnetic&#8208;electronic function in molecular&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV) Reveals Behaviorally Evoked Dopamine Release by Sugar Feeding in the Adult Drosophila Mushroom Body</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vivo fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry was developed to measure behaviorally evoked dopamine release in the mushroom body of adult Drosophila melanogaster during sugar feeding. Sugar feeding stimulated robust dopamine release and its release was pharmacologically characterized. Dopamine release was increased after applying flupentixol and nisoxetine, demonstrating D2 receptors and dopamine transporters mediate sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine signaling.







Abstract
Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is an excellent model organism for studying dopaminergic mechanisms and simple behaviors, but methods to measure dopamine during behavior are needed. Here, we developed fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to track in vivo dopamine during sugar feeding. First, we employed acetylcholine stimulation to evaluate the feasibility of in vivo measurements in an awake fly. Next, we tested sugar feeding by placing sucrose solution near the fly proboscis. In the mushroom body medial tip, 1&#8197;pmol acetylcholine and sugar feeding released 0.49&#177;0.04&#8197;&#956;M and 0.31&#177;0.06&#8197;&#956;M dopamine, respectively but sugar&#8208;evoked release lasted longer than with acetylcholine. Administering the dopamine transporter inhibitor nisoxetine or D2 receptor antagonist flupentixol significantly increased sugar&#8208;evoked dopamine. This study develops FSCV to measure behaviorally evoked release in fly, enabling Drosophila studies of neurochemical control of reward, learning, and memory behaviors.

         <title>The Linkage of Sulfonimidoyl Fluorides and Unactivated Alkenes via Hydrosulfonimidoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free linkage chemistry of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes is presented. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step in the reaction.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI) fluoride cleavage and exchanging linkage, a new generation of linkage chemistry, exhibits enormous potential for combining a range of functional molecules in an increasing number of fields. Herein, we established a metal&#8208;free linkage of unactivated alkenes and sulfonimidoyl fluorides via hydrosulfonimidoylation to construct sulfoximines within minutes. An intermolecular hydride transfer process is the key step, and it occurs via overlap of the LUMO in the sulfonimidoyl cation and HOMO in the unactivated alkene, which was confirmed via control experiments with deuterated compounds. DFT calculations further demonstrated the concerted process involving formation of the S&#8722;C(sp3) bond and hydride transfer. Remarkably, abundant natural products and pharmaceuticals with multiple heteroatoms and sensitive functional groups have been subjected to the current linkage reaction to achieve various sulfoximine linkages, furnishing the basis for drug discovery and drug conjugation.

A novel dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel realizes stable and rechargeable solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries.







Abstract
As a key component of batteries, the electrolyte determines the ion transport and interface chemistry of the cathode and anode. In this work, we develop a dual&#8208;network structured hydrogel electrolyte composed of polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium alginate (SA) and potassium iodide (KI) for solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries. The assembled hybrid battery shows excellent renewability and a long cycling life of 110&#8197;h with a high energy efficiency of 80&#8201;%. The ion&#8208;crosslinked dual&#8208;network structure endows the material with improved mechanical strength and increased ionic conductivity. More importantly, the introduction of iodine species not only offers more favorable cathodic kinetics of iodide/iodate redox than oxygen electrocatalysis but also regulates the solvation structure of zinc ions to ensure better interface stability. This work provides significant concepts for developing novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes to realize high&#8208;performance energy devices and technologies.

         <title>Tracking Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury in Real Time with a Reversible NIR&#8208;IIb Fluorescent Redox Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible fluorescent redox probe with emission beyond 1500&#8197;nm was synthesized to dynamically monitor the time&#8208;resolved reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluctuations during hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) in vivo. The strategy not only circumvents the difficulty in building reversible fluorescent probes in the NIR&#8208;II region but also offers a useful tool for early diagnosis and timely treatment of HIRI.







Abstract
Hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (HIRI) is responsible for liver dysfunction, which involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the most critical marker. Real&#8208;time monitoring of ROS during HIRI can provide significant chance for early diagnosis and timely intervention. However, there is no probe available to track ROS fluctuations during HIRI in vivo, as it is extremely challenging to design reversibly responsive fluorescent probe in near&#8208;infrared region. Here, a reversible redox probe REPOMs emitting beyond 1500&#8197;nm is proposed to fill the blank, using rare earth ions&#8208;doped nanoparticles as emitter, and molybdenum&#8208;based polyoxometalate nanoclusters as the ROS&#8208;recognition site and emission modulator. REPOMs exhibited excellent response towards the repeated cycle between ROS and glutathione, based on which the time&#8208;resolved ROS changes during HIRI were successfully obtained. This reversible probe may provide a powerful tool to promote the hepatology research in the future.

         <title>A Proton Conductive Porous Framework of an 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6&#8208;Ether Derivative Networked by Rigid Hydrogen Bonding Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF) was constructed from a 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) derivative. Although a 18C6 macrocycle is flexible and has many possible conformations, directional intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl modules in the periphery of the 18C6 allowed to form a rigid HOF with 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The wet HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH.







Abstract
A rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a C3&#8208;symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid with a hydrophilic 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether (18C6) component. Despite the flexible macrocyclic structure with many conformations, the derivative with three 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties in the periphery yielded a rigid layered porous framework through directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, the HOF possesses 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) through Grotthuss mechanism (Ea=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH. The present unique water channel structure provides an inspiration to create molecular porous materials.

Although a 18C6 macrocycle is flexible and has many possible conformations, directional intermolecular hydrogen-bonds of 4,4&#8242;-dicarboxy-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl modules in the periphery of the 18C6 allowed to form a rigid HOF with 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The wet HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) through Grotthuss mechanism (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rigid hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) was constructed from a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric hexatopic carboxylic acid with a hydrophilic 18-crown-6-ether (18C6) component. Despite the flexible macrocyclic structure with many conformations, the derivative with three 4,4&#8217;-dicarboxy-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-terphenyl moieties in the periphery yielded a rigid layered porous framework through directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, the HOF possesses 1D channels with bottleneck composed of 18C6 rings. The HOF shows proton conductivity (1.12&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) through Grotthuss mechanism (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=0.27&#8197;eV) under 98&#8201;%RH. The present unique water channel structure provides an inspiration to create molecular porous materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Radical NHC Catalysis: Divergent Difunctionalization of Olefins through Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalytic system is reported that allows an efficient difunctionalization of olefins for the divergent synthesis of various ketones. Key to success is the use of peroxyesters as &#8220;dual&#8208;role&#8221; reagents to achieve a sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation and intermolecular hydron atom transfer.







Abstract
Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, typically leading to the formation of acyl azolium reactive intermediates, constitutes one of the most important activation strategies for the NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemical transformations. Here, we report an unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalysis by using peroxyester as the external single&#8208;electron oxidant to realize divergent difunctionalization of olefins. The key to success of this chemistry is the catalytic generation of oxygen radicals that could trigger an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer to activate the inert C&#8722;H bonds, thereby enabling the productive radical relay process. With this protocol, commonly used general chemicals could serve as radical precursors to allow efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added products in a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective manner. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the NHC organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
A combination of photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation enables cascade reactions of cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;olefins, in which two rings and three bonds are constructed in one reaction, affording fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope, complete cis&#8208;selectivity, and downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential.







Abstract
Fluorinated fused rings are challenging to construct from simple starting materials. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade reactions of readily available cyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted olefins for the synthesis of fused gem&#8208;difluorooxetanes. Two rings and three bonds were efficiently constructed in one reaction. The reaction showed broad substrate scope and the downstream transformations of the products demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction. The mechanistic study supported the presence of cascade photoredox catalysis and energy transfer catalysis/direct photo&#8208;excitation processes.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Preparation of Twisted Graphene Nanoribbons by Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly twisted and fully armchair&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) have been synthesized by Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling. These twisted AGNRs have lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm and display strong emission with a fluorescence quantum yield up to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising in organic optoelectronic materials, and their properties largely depend on the size, edge, and conformation. Herein, the fully armchair&#8208;edged GNRs (AGNRs) with lengths up to 2.65&#8197;nm by using a Cu&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative coupling as a key step. The resulting AGNRs (2HBT, 3HBT, and 4HBT) possess highly twisted &#960;&#8208;scaffolds, and the torsion angles between the adjacent triphenylene moieties are larger than 32&#176;, as proved by crystallographic analyses. Theoretical and spectroscopic studies show that the butoxy groups endow AGNRs with electron&#8208;rich features, the extension of the &#960;&#8208;system from 2HBT to 4HBT reinforces S0&#8594;S1 excitation, and the distortion of the &#960;&#8208;scaffold enhances the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F). In particular, 4HBT has the lowest oxidation potential (Eox1=0.55&#8197;V vs. SCE) and displays red fluorescence with a &#934;F value of 81&#8201;%.

         <title>Rapid and Economical Chemoselective Metabolomics Using Boronate Ester Formation on a Monolithic Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and economical chemoselective labeling strategy was established involving a boronate ester reaction on a monolithic substrate. Only 15&#8197;minutes is required to complete the strategy and boron allows for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive additional isotopic encoding. The sensitivity was enhanced up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry methods.







Abstract
Although chemoselective labeling strategies show great potential in in&#8208;depth description of metabolomics, the associated time and expense limit applications in high&#8208;throughput and routine analysis. We report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multifunctionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH&#8208;responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5&#8197;min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of the substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need for expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum, and faeces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1&#8201;600 times compared with non&#8208;labeled liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) methods.

         <title>Silicon Catalyzed C&#8722;O Bond Ring Closing Metathesis of Polyethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane is applied in the selective catalytic C&#8722;O ring&#8208;closing metathesis of challenging oligo&#8208; and polyethers, enabling upcycling of polyethylene glycol. Based on detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism by DFT calculations, an improved second&#8208;generation silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid is developed.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane catalyzes C&#8722;O bond metathesis of alkyl ethers with an efficiency outperforming all earlier reported systems. Chemoselective ring contractions of macrocyclic crown ethers enable substrate&#8208;specific transformations, and an unprecedented ring&#8208;closing metathesis of polyethylene glycols allows polymer&#8208;selective degradation. Quantum chemical computations scrutinize a high Lewis acidity paired with a simultaneous low propensity for polydentate substrate binding as critical for successful catalysis. Based on these mechanistic insights, a second&#8208;generation class of silicon Lewis superacid with enhanced efficacy is identified and demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;The Lewis superacid bis(perchlorocatecholato)silane catalyzes C&#8722;O bond metathesis of alkyl ethers with an efficiency outperforming all earlier reported systems. Chemoselective ring contractions of macrocyclic crown ethers enable substrate-specific transformations, and an unprecedented ring-closing metathesis of polyethylene glycols allows polymer-selective degradation. Quantum chemical computations scrutinize a high Lewis acidity paired with a simultaneous low propensity for polydentate substrate binding as critical for successful catalysis. Based on these mechanistic insights, a second-generation class of silicon Lewis superacid with enhanced efficacy is identified and demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bifunctional CdS/MoO2/MoS2 Catalyst Enhances Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and Pyruvic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated electrons and holes in CdS hollow spheres loaded with MoS2 and MoO2 dual cocatalysts are applied to hydrogen evolution and selective pyruvic acid production, respectively. This bifunctional strategy can fully utilize the redox abilities of photogenerated electrons and holes to enhance photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO2/MoS2 hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS2 and MoO2 are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO4 in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS2 and MoO2 function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron route for PA production is proposed, initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the LA. The conversion of LA and the selectivity of PA can reach ca. 29&#8201;% and 95&#8201;% after a five&#8208;hour reaction, respectively.

         <title>2,4,6&#8208;Trimethylpyridine&#8208;Derived Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Confined Catalytic Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation at the methyl groups of a 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine monomer was promoted by in situ acylation of the nitrogen atom, yielding highly crystalline vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. The resultant Lewis basic, pyridine&#8208;decorated, regular, nanoporous structures catalyzed spatially confined organic esterification with good selectivity.







Abstract
Knoevenagel condensation is a powerful tool for the construction of vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we established a concise approach to vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation at the multi&#8208;methyl groups of a pyridine ring through in situ formation of an N&#8208;acyl pyridinium cation in the presence of various acylating reagents. Following this strategy, two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine and multi&#8208;aldehyde&#8208;substituted aromatic derivatives as monomers. The resultant COFs are highly crystalline and assembled into hexagonal lattices with specific surface areas as large as 1915&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (vs. 1972&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 of the theoretical value). The stable and abundant pyridine&#8208;decorated regular nanochannels within the COFs allow for catalyzing the esterification of several pharmaceutical intermediates with distinct spatially confined selectivity and recyclability, representing an environmentally friendly catalytic organic transformation.

         <title>Dramatically Enhanced Reactivity of Fullerenes and Tetrazine towards the Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction inside a Porous Porphyrinic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions. Moreover, hydration&#8208;induced rearrangement of C60&#8208;LA inside Zn&#8208;PB facilitates its release from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity, thus enabling Zn&#8208;PB to catalyze fullerene&#8208;pyrazoline adduct without product inhibition.







Abstract
Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction (IEDDA) between fullerenes and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine generally requires harsh conditions and long reaction times due to their strong electron&#8208;accepting nature. Herein, we report a dramatic enhancement in the reactivity of the fullerenes (C60/C70)&#8208;tetrazine reaction inside a porous Zn&#8208;porphyrinic cage (Zn&#8208;PB) under sustainable conditions by installing a tetrazine&#8208;based axle (LA) via metal&#8208;ligand coordination bond, which modulates the cavity size to facilitate the encapsulation of fullerenes. Upon encapsulation, the close proximity of fullerenes and the tetrazine group of LA dramatically increase their reactivity towards the IEDDA reaction to form fullerene&#8208;tetrazine adducts. Furthermore, the C60&#8208;tetrazine adduct is rearranged upon hydration to a bent&#8208;shaped C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct that can be released from the Zn&#8208;PB cavity in the presence of excess LA, thus catalyzing the formation of C60&#8208;pyrazoline adduct inside Zn&#8208;PB without product inhibition.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a synergistic interface bonding strategy to construct novel flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres (&#8776;500&#8197;nm) are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. The PPy@S/rGOFs cathode exhibits good mechanical property, excellent electronic conductivity and enhanced cycling performance and outstanding high&#8208;rate capacity.







Abstract
Flexible lithium sulfur batteries with high energy density and good mechanical flexibility are highly desirable. Here, we report a synergistic interface bonding enhancement strategy to construct flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. In this architecture, sulfur nanospheres and lithium polysulfides are synergistically hosted by carbon and polymer interface, which work together to provide enhanced interface chemical bonding to endow the cathode with good adsorption ability, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent mechanical flexibility. Consequently, the PPy@S/rGOFs cathode shows enhanced electrochemical performance and high&#8208;rate capability. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the enhanced electrochemical performance. In addition, a flexible Li&#8722;S pouch cell is assembled and delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Our work offers a new strategy for preparation of advanced cathodes for flexible batteries.

         <title>The First Chiro&#8208;Inositol Organosilicon Ferroelectric Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;component organosilicon ferroelectric D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol&#8208;SiMe3 is designed by using the chemical strategy of introducing quasi&#8208;spherical [&#8208;Si(CH3)3] groups into D&#8208;chiro&#8208;inositol. It exhibits the stable and electrically switchable spontaneous polarization on the thin film, which has extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Organosilicons have been used extensively in aerospace, electronics, food, medicine and other fields, due to their low viscosity, hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance, non&#8208;toxic, and physiologically inert features.

&lt;p&gt;A one-component organosilicon ferroelectric D-&lt;i&gt;chiro&lt;/i&gt;-inositol-SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is designed by using the chemical strategy of introducing quasi-spherical [-Si(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] groups into D-&lt;i&gt;chiro&lt;/i&gt;-inositol. It exhibits the stable and electrically switchable spontaneous polarization on the thin film, which has extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organosilicons have been used extensively in aerospace, electronics, food, medicine and other fields, due to their low viscosity, hydrophobicity, corrosion resistance, non-toxic, and physiologically inert features. Despite extensive interest, however, organosilicon ferroelectric crystals have never been found. Here, by using the chemical design strategy, we successfully obtained a molecular ferroelectric D-&lt;i&gt;chiro&lt;/i&gt;-inositol-SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with polar &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, whose spontaneous polarization can be electrically switchable on thin film. The introduction of organosilicon groups endows the thin films with excellent softness, ductility and flexibility (extremely low hardness of 72.8&#8197;MPa and small elastic modulus of 5.04&#8197;GPa) that are desirable for biomedical and human-compatible applications. As the first case of organosilicon ferroelectric crystal to date, this work offers a new structural paradigm for molecular ferroelectrics, and highlights their potential for flexible bio-electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Blockage Mapping for Identifying Familial Point Mutations in Single Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides with a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of single&#8208;point mutants of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide associated with familial Alzheimer's disease were simultaneously identified with aerolysin nanopores assisted by a 3D blockage mapping strategy. This is based on the combination of the conventional current blockage (Ib/I0), duration time (tD) and the reliable standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b).







Abstract
Accurate discrimination of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides containing familial point mutations would advance the knowledge of their roles in early&#8208;onset Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we simultaneously identified the mutant A21G, E22G, E22Q, and the wild&#8208;type (WT) A&#946;18&#8211;26 peptides with aerolysin nanopore using a 3D blockage mapping strategy. The standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (&#963;b) was proposed as a new supplement to current blockage (Ib/I0) and duration time (tD) to profile the blockage characteristics of single molecules. Although the WT and A21G A&#946;18&#8208;26 are indistinguishable in a traditional Ib/I0&#8208;tD 2D description, &#8764;87&#8201;% of the blockade events can be accurately classified with half reduction of false identification using a combination of Ib/I0, tD, and &#963;b. This work offers an easy and reliable strategy to promote nanopore sensitivity of peptide mutants, leading to a more precise analysis of pathogenic mutations for developing effective diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8722;N Bisindole Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers based on the de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol.







Abstract
N&#8722;N Atropisomers are a common motif in natural products and represent a significant dimension for exploration in modern pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. However, the catalytic atroposelective synthesis of such molecules remains challenging, hampering meaningful development. In particular, an enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers is unprecedented. Herein, the first enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;N bisindole atropisomers via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed de novo construction of one indole skeleton is presented. A wide variety of N&#8722;N axially chiral bisindoles were generated in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities via a cascade condensation/N&#8208;arylation reaction. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole, indole&#8208;carbazole, and non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;indole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8722;N axis were accessed using this protocol. Moreover, investigations using density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the reaction mechanism and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 Stabilized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium Catalyst for Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed single&#8208;atom Rh embedded on Ti&#8208;doped CeO2, which exhibited record&#8208;breaking TOF of 493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1, 99.1&#8201;% ethanol selectivity and outstanding stability in CO2 hydrogenation. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doping and single&#8208;atom Rh favor CHx*/CO* formation and their subsequent coupling into ethanol. Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction leads to the stabilization of single&#8208;atom Rh site and catalytic stability.







Abstract
Development of effective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol remains a challenge. Herein, we report that Rh1/CeTiOx single&#8208;atom catalyst constructed by embedding monoatomic Rh onto Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 support has shown a super high ethanol selectivity (&#8776;99.1&#8201;%), record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency (493.1&#8197;h&#8722;1), and outstanding stability. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doption and monoatomic Rh contribute to this excellent catalytic performance by firstly facilitating oxygen vacancies formation to generate oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;Rh Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;base pairs, which favor CO2 adsorption and activation, cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in CHxOH* and COOH* into CHx* and CO* species, subsequent C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogenation into ethanol, and secondly generating strong Rh&#8722;O bond by Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction, which contributes to striking stability. This work highlights the importance of support elaborating regulation for single&#8208;atom catalyst design to substantially improve the catalytic performance.

         <dc:description>
The nickel catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type coupling of aryl sulfamates and boronic acid derivatives enabled by temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry via the development of a programmable PID&#8208;controlled jar heater is reported. This base&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free, all&#8208;under&#8208;air protocol was also scaled 200&#8208;fold using twin&#8208;screw extrusion technology affording decagram quantities of material.







Abstract
The use of temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry to enable the mechanochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling is herein described. Transitioning from a capricious room&#8208;temperature protocol, through to a heated, PID&#8208;controlled programmable jar heater manifold was required to deliver an efficient method for the coupling of aryl sulfamates (derived from ubiquitous phenols) and aryl boronic acid species. Furthermore, this process is conducted using a base&#8208;metal nickel catalyst, in the absence of bulk solvent, and in the absence of air/moisture sensitive reaction set&#8208;ups. This methodology is showcased through translation to large&#8208;scale twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodology enabling 200&#8208;fold scale increase, producing decagram quantities of C&#8722;C coupled material.

         <title>Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic Synergy in BiFeO3@COF Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructures for High&#8208;Efficiency Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent bonds to form a high&#8208;efficient Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure piezo&#8208;photocatalyst with tunable shell thickness for overall water splitting. The optimal sample reveals the unprecedented H2 and O2 production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with visible light irradiation. This work will provide a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting is an ideal way to generate renewable energy while still challenging. For the first time, this work combined covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and piezoelectric material by covalent linkages to form Z&#8208;scheme core@shell heterostructure for overall water splitting. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the polarized electric field and photo&#8208;generated charges, as well as the precise adjustment of shell thickness, the carrier separation and utilization efficiency is greatly improved. The optimal BiFeO3@TpPa&#8208;1&#8208;COF photocatalyst revealed hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production rates of 1416.4 and 708.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the excitation of ultrasonication coupled with light irradiation, which is the best performance among various piezo&#8208; and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This provides a new sight for the practical application of highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Dynamic AIE crosslinks in liquid crystal networks: visualizing for actuation&#8208;guiding, re&#8208;bonding for actuation&#8208;altering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel covalent adaptable liquid crystal network (CALCN) actuators crosslinked by dynamic AIE luminogens were built based on Diels&#8211;Alder chemistry. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one material design &#8220;visualizes&#8221;, through fluorescing, the crosslinking state and actuation capability for actuation&#8208;guiding in CALCN, while enabling network &#8220;re&#8208;bonding&#8221; through associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms for unprecedented actuation&#8208;reprogrammability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable liquid crystal networks (CALCNs) are highly potential actuating materials due to their actuation properties and shape reprogrammability. Given the importance of network crosslinking state in a CALCN actuator, we sought an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to probe and visualize its dynamic network while ensuring actuation and reprogramming. Here, tetraphenylethylene derivatives were incorporated into liquid crystal networks via the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) reaction, acting simultaneously as reversible crosslinkers and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probes. The thermally tunable fluorescence of the resulting network can correlate to and thus visualize the actuator's crosslinking status, actuation capability and temperature in real&#8208;time and in situ, yielding an intriguing actuation limit&#8208;alerting function. Furthermore, we verified unprecedented reprogrammability of the AIE&#8208;type CALCNs through both associative and dissociative exchange mechanisms of DA chemistry.

         <title>Intranuclear Nanoribbons for Selective Killing of Osteosarcoma Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon the dephosphorylation of ALP, the leucine&#8208;rich phosphopeptides self&#8208;assemble into micelles and then convert into nanoribbons. The phosphopeptides/assemblies first aggregate on the cell membrane of osteosarcoma cells, and then enter cells via endocytosis, disrupt the nuclear membrane, and finally accumulate in nuclei by interaction with histone proteins to induce cell death.







Abstract
Herein, we show intranuclear nanoribbons formed upon dephosphorylation of leucine&#8208;rich L&#8208; or D&#8208;phosphopeptide catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to selectively kill osteosarcoma cells. Being dephosphorylated by ALP, the peptides are first transformed into micelles and then converted into nanoribbons. The peptides/assemblies first aggregate on cell membranes, then enter cells via endocytosis, and finally accumulate in nuclei (mainly in nucleoli). Proteomics analysis suggests that the assemblies interact with histone proteins. The peptides kill osteosarcoma cells rapidly and are nontoxic to normal cells. Moreover, the repeated stimulation of the osteosarcoma cells by the peptides sensitizes the cancer cells rather than inducing resistance. This work not only illustrates a novel mechanism for nucleus targeting, but may also pave a new way for selectively killing osteosarcoma cells and minimizing drug resistance.

         <title>Activity&#8208;based Photoacoustic Probes Reveal Elevated Intestinal MGL and FAAH Activity in a Murine Model of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;based sensing probes and whole&#8208;body photoacoustic imaging have enabled the selective detection of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) activity in the context of obesity and gastrointestinal tract inflammation.







Abstract
Obesity is a chronic health condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat which can lead to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease, type&#8208;II diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer through systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, visualizing key mediators of the inflammatory response, such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), in a selective manner is a profound challenge owing to an overlapping substrate scope that involves arachidonic acid (AA). Specifically, these enzymes work in concert to generate AA, which in the context of obesity, has been implicated to control appetite and energy metabolism. In this study, we developed the first selective activity&#8208;based sensing probes to detect MGL (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL) and FAAH (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH) activity via photoacoustic imaging. Activation of PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH by their target enzymes resulted in 1.74&#8208;fold and 1.59&#8208;fold signal enhancements, respectively. Due to their exceptional selectivity profiles and deep&#8208;tissue photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these probes were employed to measure MGL and FAAH activity in a murine model of obesity. Contrary to conflicting reports suggesting levels of MGL can be attenuated or elevated, our results support the latter. Indeed, we discovered a marked increase of both targets in the gastrointestinal tract. These key findings set the stage to uncover the role of the endocannabinoid pathway in obesity&#8208;mediated inflammation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Darwin&#8217;s warm pond rich with nutrients, lesser number of early catalytic machineries with modest capabilities were able to demonstrate promiscuity by catalyzing diverse biochemical transformations important for protometabolism. Herein, we report catalytically promiscuous amyloid&#8208;based short peptide assemblies that could concomitantly catalyse three metabolically important yet orthogonal reactions. The surface exposed catalytic dyads featuring lysines and imidazoles were utilized for C=N condensation via dynamic covalent linkages and modulation of protonation events, respectively. Further, the peptide assemblies could promiscuously catalyse hydrolysis as well as retro&#8208;aldol reactions, that could be co&#8208;opted to facilitate C=N bond formation, either by a feedforward&#8208;driven reaction network or by replenishing depleted substrates. The catalytic diversity of short peptide based promiscuous &#946;&#8208;sheet folds suggests their possible role in promoting the protometabolic network in early earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymers need to start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2  emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers need to be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This review explores how scientific advances, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Orange&#8208;Red Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescent CsCdCl3:Mn2+ Perovskite Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide perovskite has been widely studied as a new generation of photoelectronic materials. However, their thermal and humidity&#8208;induced emission quenching have greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we report a hexagonal Mn2+&#8208;doped CsCdCl3 perovskite crystal that possesses stable photoluminescence (PL) at both high temperature and humidity. The room temperature long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) of the single crystals lasts up to 1480 s and can be adjusted by changing the concentration of Mn2+ ion doping. The characteristic emission of d&#8208;d transition of Mn2+ is realized, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is up to 91.4%, it can maintain more than 90% of the initial PL spectral integral area at 150 &#176;C (423 K). High humid stability PL can be achieved more than 75% of the initial PL intensity after 55 days of immersion in water. These excellent properties show the application prospect of the LPL material in lighting indication and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Metal&#8208;Air Batteries: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;air batteries are considered one of the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices owing to their ultrahigh theoretical specific energy. However, sluggish cathode kinetics (O2 and CO2 reduction/evolution) result in large overpotentials and low round&#8208;trip efficiencies which seriously hinder their practical applications. Utilizing light to drive slow cathode processes has increasingly becoming a promising solution to this issue. Considering the rapid development and emerging issues of this field, this review aims to timely summarize the current understanding of light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;air batteries in terms of configurations and mechanisms, provides the general design strategies and specific examples of photocathodes, systematically discuss the influences of light on the battery, and finally provide existing gaps and future priorities towards practical light&#8208;assisted metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthetic Elucidation and Structural Revision of Brevione E: Characterization of the Key Dioxygenase for Pathway Branching from Setosusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brevione E (1) is a fungal hexacyclic meroditerpenoid with unique oxepane and cycloheptenone moieties. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of&#160;1&#160;and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway via heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Surprisingly, reexamination of the structure of&#160;1&#160;revealed a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring instead of the previously proposed oxepane system. Moreover, we determined that cycloheptenone synthesis involves skeletal rearrangement catalyzed by the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase BrvJ. BrvJ is highly homologous to SetK, which engages in the biosynthesis of another fungal metabolite, setosusin, and accepts the same substrate as BrvJ but performs only simple hydroxylation. Finally, we identified the key amino acid residues critical for product selectivity of BrvJ and SetK, providing insight into how the biosynthesis pathways of&#160;1&#160;and setosusin diverge and how fungi diversify natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3 V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000 times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Dependence of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Assembly Kinetics: Unravelling the Microscopic Molecular Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is the assembly of the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide (A&#946;) into fibrils. A reduction in pH accompanying inflammation or subcellular compartments, may accelerate fibril formation as the pH approaches A&#946;&#8217;s isoelectric point (pI). Using global fitting of thioflavin&#8208;T to monitor fibril formation kinetics over a range of pHs, we identify the impact net charge has on individual microscopic rate constants which are associated with fibril assembly. We show that the primary nucleation has a strong pH dependence. The titration behaviour exhibits a mid&#8208;point or pKa of 7.0, close to the pKa of A&#946; histidine imidazoles. Surprisingly, both the secondary nucleation and elongation rate constants are pH independent. This indicates the charge of A&#946;, in particular histidine protonation, has little impact on this stage of A&#946; assembly. These fundamental processes are key to understanding the forces that drive the assembly of A&#946; into toxic oligomers and fibrils.</dc:description>
