         <title>Aziridine formation by a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent oxygenase and 2&#8208;aminoisobutyrate biosynthesis in fungi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aziridine is a characteristically reactive molecule with increased bioactivity due to its strained ring structure. Here, we investigated the biosynthesis of 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) in&#160;  Penicillium  , and successfully reconstituted the three&#8208;step biosynthesis from L&#8208;Val to AIB  &#160;in vitro  . This previously unknown aziridine formation pathway proceeded with the non&#8208;heme iron and&#160; a &#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent (Fe(II)/ &#945; KG) oxygenase TqaL, followed by aziridine ring opening by the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (HAD)&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation by the NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the C&#8208;N bond forming Fe(II)/ &#945; KG oxygenase TqaL was solved at 2.0 &#197; resolution. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis, thereby expanding the catalytic repertoire of the Fe(II)/ &#945; KG oxygenases. We also report the unique aziridine ring opening by a HAD&#8208;type hydrolase and the remarkable oxidative decarboxylation by a non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase to produce AIB.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Converted In2O3 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships in nanostructured catalysts is of fundamental importance. The size modulation of catalyst particles represents a useful dimension to tune catalytic performances by impacting not only their surface areas but also local electronic structures. It, however, has remained inadequately explored and poorly elucidated. Here, we report the interesting size&#8208;dependent selectivity of electrochemical CO  2  reduction on In  2  O  3  nanocrystals. 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles and 15&#8208;nm nanocubes with focused size distribution are prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction in oleylamine by carefully controlling a set of experimental parameters. They serve as the precatalysts, and are reduced to In nanocrystals while largely inherit the original size feature during electrochemical CO  2  reduction. Catalyst derived from 15&#8208;nm nanocubes exhibits greater formate selectivity (&gt;95%) at lower overpotential and negligible side reactions compared to bulk&#8208;like samples (indium foil and 200&#8208;nm cubes) as well as the catalyst derived from smaller 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways by our theoretical computations. Smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Counting Coupled to Rapid Amplification Enables Detection of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregates in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Parkinson's Disease Patients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11874-11883, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new single&#8208;molecule method was established for the detection of &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibrils, a promising biomarker of Parkinson's disease (PD). Individual ThT(+) aggregates were fingerprinted and amplified to improve detection limits by 3 orders of magnitude, compared to direct detection. A difference of behaviour was detected between PD and control samples.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and a promising biomarker for early detection and assessment of disease progression. The prospect of a molecular test for Parkinson's disease is materializing with the recent developments of detection methods based on amplification of synuclein seeds (e.g. RT&#8208;QuIC or PMCA). Here we adapted single&#8208;molecule counting methods for the detection of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), using a simple 3D printed microscope. Single&#8208;molecule methods enable to probe the early events in the amplification process used in RT&#8208;QuIC and a precise counting of ThT&#8208;positive aggregates. Importantly, the use of single&#8208;molecule counting also allows a refined characterization of the samples and fingerprinting of the protein aggregates present in CSF of patients. The fingerprinting of size and reactivity of individual aggregate shows a unique signature for each PD patients compared to controls and may provide new insights on synucleinopathies in the future.

         <title>Magnetization Transfer to Enhance NOE Cross&#8208;Peaks among Labile Protons: Applications to Imino&#8211;Imino Sequential Walks in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Derived RNAs</title>

         <dc:description>
An approach to enhance the sensitivity of 2D NOESY correlations among labile protons is introduced and exemplified with experiments on RNA fragments derived from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome and with other samples. The approach leads to experiments that are ca. 10&#8208;fold faster and 3&#8208;fold more sensitive than conventional counterparts. The mechanism of this sensitivity boost is explained, and its strengths and limitations are analyzed.







Abstract
2D NOESY plays a central role in structural NMR spectroscopy. We have recently discussed methods that rely on solvent&#8208;driven exchanges to enhance NOE correlations between exchangeable and non&#8208;exchangeable protons in nucleic acids. Such methods, however, fail when trying to establish connectivities within pools of labile protons. This study introduces an alternative that also enhances NOEs between such labile sites, based on encoding a&#8197;priori selected peaks by selective saturations. The resulting selective magnetization transfer (SMT) experiment proves particularly useful for enhancing the imino&#8211;imino cross&#8208;peaks in RNAs, which is a first step in the NMR resolution of these structures. The origins of these enhancements are discussed, and their potential is demonstrated on RNA fragments derived from the genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, recorded with better sensitivity and an order of magnitude faster than conventional 2D counterparts.

         <title>Asymmetric Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Hydrosilylation/Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 12046-12052, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral alkylsilanes with a catalyst generated in situ from Co(acac)2 and (R,Sp)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of 1,6&#8208;enynes react to afford the corresponding alkylsilanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
We report an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with secondary and tertiary hydrosilanes employing a catalyst generated in situ from the combination of Co(acac)2 and (R,Sp)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and carbon&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes reacted with Ph2SiH2, (EtO)3SiH, or (RO)2MeSiH to afford the corresponding chiral organosilane products in high yields and up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. This cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization also occurred with prochiral secondary hydrosilane PhMeSiH2 to yield chiral alkylsilanes containing both carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with modest diastereoselectivity. The chiral organosilane products from this cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation/cyclization could be converted to a variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds by stereospecific conversion of their C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;H bonds without loss of enantiopurity.

&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes is developed to access synthetically versatile chiral alkylsilanes with a catalyst generated in situ from Co(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of 1,6&#8208;enynes react to afford the corresponding alkylsilanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization reaction of 1,6&#8208;enynes with secondary and tertiary hydrosilanes employing a catalyst generated in situ from the combination of Co(acac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;Josiphos. A wide range of oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and carbon&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes reacted with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, (EtO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiH, or (RO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeSiH to afford the corresponding chiral organosilane products in high yields and up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;. This cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation/cyclization also occurred with prochiral secondary hydrosilane PhMeSiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield chiral alkylsilanes containing both carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantioselectivity, albeit with modest diastereoselectivity. The chiral organosilane products from this cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation/cyclization could be converted to a variety of chiral five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds by stereospecific conversion of their C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;H bonds without loss of enantiopurity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversible Ratiometric NADH Sensing Using Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 12007-12012, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, rapid analytical method for NADH sensing is achieved by electron transfer from a Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity, excellent selectivity versus other analytes, and a fast and reversible response. Smartphone&#8208;based in vivo ratiometric imaging of NADH is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.







Abstract
Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is a key coenzyme in living cells due to its role as an electron carrier in redox reactions, and its concentration is an important indicator of cell metabolic state. Abnormal NADH levels are associated with age&#8208;related metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, creating a demand for a simple, rapid analytical method for point&#8208;of&#8208;care NADH sensing. Here we develop a series of NADH&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) as nanoprobes for NADH measurement, and test their performance in vitro and in vivo. NADH sensing is based on electron transfer from semiconducting polymer chains in the Pdot to NADH upon UV excitation, quenching Pdot fluorescence emission. In polyfluorene&#8208;based Pdots, this mechanism resulted in an on&#8208;off NADH sensor; in DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots, UV excitation resulted in NADH&#8208;sensitive emission at two wavelengths, enabling ratiometric detection. Ratiometric NADH detection using DPA&#8208;CNPPV Pdots exhibits high sensitivity (3.1&#8197;&#956;M limit of detection), excellent selectivity versus other analytes, reversibility, and a fast response (less than 5&#8197;s). We demonstrate applications of the ratiometric NADH&#8208;sensing Pdots including smartphone&#8208;based NADH imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Performance PEO&#8208;based Ternary Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11919-11927, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) allow improvement of the ionic conductivity of ternary PEO&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes. However, the lack of Li&#8208;ion coordination of these plasticizers and the addition of extra ions results in a low Li&#8208;ion conductivity. An oligo(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based IL was synthesized to overcome these limitations and enable additional transport modes, resulting in a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates as non&#8208;flammable plasticizers for lowering the operation temperature of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), but they present limitations in terms of lithium&#8208;ion transport, such as a much lower lithium transference number. Thus, a pyrrolidinium cation was prepared with an oligo(ethylene oxide) substituent with seven repeating units. We show, by a combination of experimental characterizations and simulations, that the cation's solvating properties allow faster lithium&#8208;ion transport than alkyl&#8208;substituted analogues when incorporated in SPEs. This proceeds not only by accelerating the conduction modes of PEO, but also by enabling new conduction modes linked to the solvation of lithium by a single IL cation. This, combined with favorable interfacial properties versus lithium metal, leads to significantly improved performance on lithium&#8208;metal polymer batteries.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Intermolecular Interaction in Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Ultralong Life Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

The dense interfacial Li+ conduction pathways between garnet fillers and polymer matrix via the open&#8208;ring reaction of ethylene carbonate initiated by LiOH/Li2CO3 contaminant on LLZTO is reported, which results in the superior ionic conductivity of composite electrolytes at room temperature and long lifespan of assembled solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries built with composite polymer electrolytes using cubic garnets as active fillers are particularly attractive owing to their high energy density, easy manufacturing and inherent safety. However, the uncontrollable formation of intractable contaminant on garnet surface usually aggravates poor interfacial contact with polymer matrix and deteriorates Li+ pathways. Here we report a rational designed intermolecular interaction in composite electrolytes that utilizing contaminants as reaction initiator to generate Li+ conducting ether oligomers, which further emerge as molecular cross&#8208;linkers between inorganic fillers and polymer matrix, creating dense and homogeneous interfacial Li+ immigration channels in the composite electrolytes. The delicate design results in a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.43&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and an unprecedented 1000&#8197;cycles with 90&#8201;% capacity retention at room temperature is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Iron/Cobalt Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

The ultrathin MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets (2.2&#8197;nm) can be prepared via stirring at room temperature by precise control of solvent. The 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets show an excellent OER activity, which was caused by its abundant unsaturated coordinated metal sites and the synergistic effect of iron and cobalt. The high OER activity of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co nanosheets is further supported by the DFT calculations.







Abstract
A facile synthesis is reported of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bimetallic (Fe/Co=1:2) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF, ca. 2.2&#8197;nm thick) via simple stirring of the reaction mixture of Fe/Co salts and 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;BDC) in the presence of triethylamine and water at room temperature. The mechanism of the 2D, rather than bulk, MOF was revealed by studying the role of each component in the reaction mixture. It was found that these 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under basic conditions. The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co&#8208;doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.

The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co&#8208;doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunable Hollow Nanoreactors for In Situ Synthesis of GeP Electrodes towards High&#8208;Performance Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 12103-12108, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique structure of hollow nanoreactors is designed for in situ synthesis of GeP electrodes. Such size&#8208;tunable nanoreactors not only ensure sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport but also restrain the crystal growth and accommodate the volume expansion of GeP, consequently leading to superior sodium storage performance.







Abstract
The practical application of germanium phosphide (GeP) in battery systems is seriously impeded referring to the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe volume change. Nanostructure design that elaborately resolves the above issues is highly desired but still remains a big challenge. Herein, unique hollow nanoreactors assembled with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon networks for in situ synthesis of the GeP electrodes are proposed for the first time. Such nanoreactors form a self&#8208;supported conductive network, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport. They restrain crystal growth and accommodate the volume expansion of GeP simultaneously. Reaction kinetics and confinement effect are optimized through nanoreactor size regulation. The optimized GeP electrode has high reversible capacities and outstanding cyclability and rate performance for sodium storage, outperforming most previously reported phosphides.

         <title>Physical Separation of H2 Activation from Hydrogenation Chemistry Reveals the Specific Role of Secondary Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11937-11942, May 17, 2021. </description>

A hydrogen&#8208;selective palladium membrane enables reactive hydrogen formation and substrate hydrogenation to occur on separate metals at the opposing surface of the palladium membrane. This electrochemical platform was used to demonstrate that gold is an active hydrogenation catalyst if not burdened with forming reactive hydrogen.







Abstract
An electrocatalytic palladium membrane reactor (ePMR) uses electricity and water to drive hydrogenation without H2 gas. The device contains a palladium membrane to physically separate the formation of reactive hydrogen atoms from hydrogenation of the unsaturated organic substrate. This separation provides an opportunity to independently measure the hydrogenation reaction at a surface without any competing H2 activation or proton reduction chemistry. We took advantage of this feature to test how different metal catalysts coated on the palladium membrane affect the rates of hydrogenation of C=O and C=C bonds. Hydrogenation occurs at the secondary metal catalyst and not the underlying palladium membrane. These secondary catalysts also serve to accelerate the reaction and draw a higher flux of hydrogen through the membrane. These results reveal insights into hydrogenation chemistry that would be challenging using thermal or electrochemical hydrogenation experiments.

         <title>Direct Activation of a Remote C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond Enabled by a Visible&#8208;Light Photosensitized Allene Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 12053-12059, May 17, 2021. </description>

Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activations via excited triplet state of allene derivatives have been demonstrated. The reaction mechanisms were investigated by deuterium labeling and kinetic quenching experiments as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
Despite allene derivatives have been always regarded as a radical accepter in traditional radical chemistry for decades, the reactivity of allene derivatives under excited state in radical chemistry was rarely explored. Herein, we wish to report an example to engage triplet&#8208;excited state of allene moiety as hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) partner in the activation of remote sp3 C&#8722;H bond via visible&#8208;light irradiation under mild reaction conditions with broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. The reaction mechanism involving the generation of triplet excited state of allene derivative and the subsequent HAT process was supported by deuterium labeling, kinetic analysis experiments and DFT calculations.

         <title>An Artificial Phase&#8208;Transitional Underwater Bioglue with Robust and Switchable Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 12082-12089, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;based robust bioadhesive was assembled through complex coacervation. The aggregation trend of valine&#8208;rich domains and the change in the backbone conformational states reversibly triggered the phase transition and the enhanced wet adhesion bonding.







Abstract
Complex coacervation enables important wet adhesion processes in natural and artificial systems. However, existed synthetic coacervate adhesives show limited wet adhesion properties, non&#8208;thermoresponsiveness, and inferior biodegradability, greatly hampering their translations. Herein, by harnessing supramolecular assembly and rational protein design, we present a temperature&#8208;sensitive wet bioadhesive fabricated through recombinant protein and surfactant. Mechanical performance of the bioglue system is actively tunable with thermal triggers. In cold condition, adhesion strength of the bioadhesive was only about 50&#8197;kPa. By increasing temperature, the strength presented up to 600&#8197;kPa, which is remarkably stronger than other biological counterparts. This is probably due to the thermally triggered phase transition of the engineered protein and the formation of coacervate, thus leading to the enhanced wet adhesion bonding.

         <title>Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Chemoselective Hydroboration of Isocyanates: Amide Bond Formation and C=O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11991-12000, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zinc&#8208;catalyzed selective reduction of isocyanates via hydroboration is reported for the first time. Amide bond formation by the chemoselective reduction of isocyanates and hydrodeoxygenation of isocyanates to secondary methyl amine have been described.







Abstract
Herein, a remarkable conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) supported zinc hydride, [{LZnH}2; L={(ArHN)(ArN)&#8722;C=N&#8722;C=(NAr)(NHAr); Ar=2,6&#8208;Et2&#8208;C6H3}] (I) catalyzed partial reduction of heteroallenes via hydroboration is reported. A large number of aryl and alkyl isocyanates, including electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing groups, undergo reduction to obtain selectively N&#8208;boryl formamide, bis(boryl) hemiaminal and N&#8208;boryl methyl amine products. The compound I effectively catalyzes the chemoselective reduction of various isocyanates, in which the construction of the amide bond occurs. Isocyanates undergo a deoxygenation hydroboration reaction, in which the C=O bond cleaves, leading to N&#8208;boryl methyl amines. Several functionalities such as nitro, cyano, halide, and alkene groups are well&#8208;tolerated. Furthermore, a series of kinetic, control experiments and structurally characterized intermediates suggest that the zinc hydride species are responsible for all reduction steps and breaking the C=O bond.

         <title>Proton Capture Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Atomically Dispersed Metal&#8211;Nitrogen Active Sites**
</title>

A proton capture strategy was developed to assist atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen active sites for accelerating reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts play a key role in accelerating the sluggish electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) involving multi&#8208;electron and proton transfer. We now develop a proton capture strategy by accelerating the water dissociation reaction catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal nanoparticles (NPs) adjacent to atomically dispersed and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single nickel (Ni&#8722;Nx) active sites to accelerate proton transfer to the latter for boosting the intermediate protonation step, and thus the whole ECR process. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and calculations reveal that the Ni NPs accelerate the adsorbed H (Had) generation and transfer to the adjacent Ni&#8722;Nx sites for boosting the intermediate protonation and the overall ECR processes. This proton capture strategy is universal to design and prepare for various high&#8208;performance catalysts for diverse electrochemical reactions even beyond ECR.

         <title>Selective Implantation of Diamines for Cooperative Catalysis in Isoreticular Heterometallic Titanium&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

The different affinity of Ti(IV) and Ca(II) sites was used to direct selective coordination of amines. This enables the combination of Lewis acid and available &#8208;NH2 sites in sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. MUV&#8208;12 displays full conversion of propylene oxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in absence of additional co&#8208;catalysts and with excellent cyclability.







Abstract
We introduce the first example of isoreticular titanium&#8211;organic frameworks, MUV&#8208;10 and MUV&#8208;12, to show how the different affinity of hard Ti(IV) and soft Ca(II) metal sites can be used to direct selective grafting of amines. This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available &#8208;NH2 sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The selective grafting of molecules to heterometallic clusters adds up to the pool of methodologies available for controlling the positioning and distribution of chemical functions in precise positions of the framework required for definitive control of pore chemistry.

         <title>Discovery of a Macropinocytosis&#8208;Inducing Peptide Potentiated by Medium&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Disulfide Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11928-11936, May 17, 2021. </description>

Macropinocytosis is as a ubiquitous cellular delivery route. A short macropinocytosis&#8208;inducing peptide P4A is identified that undergoes thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reaction, yielding a potent intramolecular oxidized analogue (oxP4A). The conjugate of oxP4A and the membrane lytic peptide LK15 delivered functional proteins. This peptide delivers proteins fused with a supernegatively charged protein tag at nanomolar concentrations.







Abstract
Macropinocytosis is a ubiquitous cellular uptake mechanism of peptide&#8208;based intracellular delivery. This entry pathway shows promise as a route for the intracellular uptake of biomacromolecules and nanoparticles. In this work, we obtained the 8&#8208;residue analogue P4A bearing higher macropinocytosis induction ability. P4A contains vital cysteine residues in its sequence, which immediately reacts with cystine in culture medium to convert into its oxidized forms, including the intramolecularly oxidized form (oxP4A) as the dominant and active species. The conjugate of oxP4A and the membrane lytic peptide LK15 delivered bioactive proteins into cells; notably, this peptide delivered functional proteins fused with a negatively charged protein tag at a significantly reduced amount (up to nanomolar range) without compromising the delivery efficiency and the cellular activities of delivered proteins.

A NaClO4/NaOTF electrolyte was designed for aqueous Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs). The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing NaF&#8211;Na2O&#8211;NaOH forming on the anode extended the cathodic limiting potential of electrolyte to 1.6&#8197;V, and the hydrophobic anions extend the anodic to 4.4&#8197;V. A 1.75&#8197;V Na3V2(PO4)3&#8741;Na3V2(PO4)3 cell achieved a high energy density of 70&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with 87.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISE) have largely widened the electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes by formation of passivating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and also absorption of the hydrophobic anion&#8208;rich double layer on cathode. However, the cathodic limiting potential of WISE is still too high for most high&#8208;capacity anodes in aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs), and the cost of WISE is also too high for practical application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost 19&#8197;m (m: mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) bi&#8208;salts WISE with a wide ESW of 2.8&#8197;V was designed, where the low&#8208;cost 17&#8197;m NaClO4 extends the anodic limiting potential to 4.4&#8197;V, while the fluorine&#8208;containing salt (2&#8197;m NaOTF) extends the cathodic limiting potential to 1.6&#8197;V by forming the NaF&#8211;Na2O&#8211;NaOH SEI on anode. The 19&#8197;m NaClO4&#8211;NaOTF&#8211;H2O electrolyte enables a 1.75&#8197;V Na3V2(PO4)3&#8741;Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell to deliver an appreciable energy density of 70&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C with a capacity retention of 87.5&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

Ultrathin porous Pd metallene with rich nanocrystal defects were prepared by a one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method for superior oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes.







Abstract
Metallene with fantastic physicochemical properties is considered as a potential candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Controlling the morphology and structure of metallene can provide a great opportunity to improve its catalytic performance. Herein, defect&#8208;rich ultrathin porous Pd metallene (a sub&#8208;nanometer and curved metal nanosheet) is developed by facile wet&#8208;chemistry strategy for efficient and stable ORR electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. The defect&#8208;rich porous Pd metallene provides abundant highly active sites and vacancy defects, showing superior ORR activity of 0.892&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. The mass activity is 5.1 and 16.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, and maintains well after 5000&#8197;cycles. The strain effect and tunable electronic structure derived from highly curved sub&#8208;nanometer nanosheet morphology contribute to the excellent ORR performance by the optimization of oxygen binding ability on Pd. The superior catalytic performance of Pd metallene may open an avenue to design other metallene materials for various fields.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Stimulated Efficient Photocatalytic N2 Fixation over Defective BaTiO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11910-11918, May 17, 2021. </description>

A model ferroelectric photocatalyst, BaTiO3, was treated with NaBH4 to introduce surface oxygen vacancies (Ov&#8208;BTO). The resultant material offers spin&#8208;polarized regulation and an increased internal electric field (IEF). The function of Ov&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity under an external magnetic field is explored and the positive effect of the external magnetic field phenomenon demonstrated on photocatalytic N2 fixation.







Abstract
Efficient coupling solar energy conversion and N2 fixation by photocatalysis has been shown promising potentials. However, the unsatisfied yield rate of NH3 curbs its forward application. Defective typical perovskite, BaTiO3, shows remarkable activity under an applied magnetic field for photocatalytic N2 fixation with an NH3 yield rate exceeding 1.93&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through steered surface spin states and oxygen vacancies, the electromagnetic synergistic effect between the internal electric field and an external magnetic field is stimulated. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the regulation of electronic and magnetic properties through manipulation of oxygen vacancies and inducement of Lorentz force and spin selectivity effect. The electromagnetic effect suppresses the recombination of photoexcited carriers in semiconducting nanomaterials, which acts synergistically to promote N2 adsorption and activation while facilitating fast charge separation under UV&#8208;vis irradiation.

         <title>Dynamically Re&#8208;Organized Collagen Fiber Bundles Transmit Mechanical Signals and Induce Strongly Correlated Cell Migration and Self&#8208;Organization</title>

Collagen fibers are dynamically re&#8208;organized by cells, and are able to transmit tensile force for precise cell&#8208;communication at single&#8208;cells level. This mechanism also explains the self&#8208;organization of multiple cells in the quasi&#8208;3D microenvironment.







Abstract
Correlated cell migration in fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) is important in many biological processes. During migration, cells can remodel the ECM, leading to the formation of mesoscale structures such as fiber bundles. However, how such mesoscale structures regulate correlated single&#8208;cells migration remains to be elucidated. Here, using a quasi&#8208;3D in vitro model, we investigate how collagen fiber bundles are dynamically re&#8208;organized and guide cell migration. By combining laser ablation technique with 3D tracking and active&#8208;particle simulations, we definitively show that only the re&#8208;organized fiber bundles that carry significant tensile forces can guide strongly correlated cell migration, providing for the first time a direct experimental evidence supporting that matrix&#8208;transmitted long&#8208;range forces can regulate cell migration and self&#8208;organization. This force regulation mechanism can provide new insights for studies on cellular dynamics, fabrication or selection of biomedical materials in tissue repairing, and many other biomedical applications.

Methods for regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin remain limited. A thioacetate orienting group expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using DIBAL&#8208;H promoted debenzylation. This method allowed the synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. A random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin poly&#8208;functionalization has fueled progress in their use in multiple applications such as enzyme mimicry, but also in the polymer sciences, luminescence, as sensors or for biomedical applications. However, regioselective access to a given pattern of functions on &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin is still very limited. We uncover a new orienting group, the thioacetate, that expands the toolbox available for cyclodextrin poly&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalization using diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL&#8208;H) promoted debenzylation. The usefulness of this group is illustrated in the first synthesis of a precisely hepta&#8208;hetero&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. By way of comparison, a random hepta&#8208;functionalization would give 117655 different molecules. This synthesis is not simply the vain quest for the Holy Grail of CD hetero&#8208;functionalization, but it illustrates the versatility of the DIBAL&#8208;H oriented hetero&#8208;functionalization strategy, opening the way to a multitude of useful functionalization patterns for new practical applications.

         <title>Polymorphism in Squaraine Dye Aggregates by Self&#8208;Assembly Pathway Differentiation: Panchromatic Tubular Dye Nanorods versus J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11949-11958, May 17, 2021. </description>

The self&#8208;assembly of a newly synthesized bis(squaraine) dye was investigated revealing a supramolecular polymorphism dependent on the cooling rate. Fast cooling leads to helical nanorods, while slow cooling leads to more organized nanosheets.







Abstract
A bis(squaraine) dye equipped with alkyl and oligoethyleneglycol chains was synthesized by connecting two dicyanomethylene substituted squaraine dyes with a phenylene spacer unit. The aggregation behavior of this bis(squaraine) was investigated in non&#8208;polar toluene/tetrachloroethane (98:2) solvent mixture, which revealed competing cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathways into two supramolecular polymorphs with entirely different packing structures and UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties. The self&#8208;assembly pathway can be controlled by the cooling rate from a heated solution of the monomers. For both polymorphs, quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions between monomers and the respective aggregates can be established to derive thermodynamic parameters and insights into the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. AFM measurements revealed a nanosheet structure with a height of 2&#8197;nm for the thermodynamically more stable polymorph and a tubular nanorod structure with a helical pitch of 13&#8197;nm and a diameter of 5&#8197;nm for the kinetically favored polymorph. Together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements, packing models were derived: the thermodynamic polymorph consists of brick&#8208;work type nanosheets that exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands as typical for J&#8208;aggregates, while the nanorod polymorph consists of eight supramolecular polymer strands of the bis(squaraine) intertwined to form a chimney&#8208;type tubular structure.

&lt;p&gt;The self&#8208;assembly of a newly synthesized bis(squaraine) dye was investigated revealing a supramolecular polymorphism dependent on the cooling rate. Fast cooling leads to helical nanorods, while slow cooling leads to more organized nanosheets.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bis(squaraine) dye equipped with alkyl and oligoethyleneglycol chains was synthesized by connecting two dicyanomethylene substituted squaraine dyes with a phenylene spacer unit. The aggregation behavior of this bis(squaraine) was investigated in non&#8208;polar toluene/tetrachloroethane (98:2) solvent mixture, which revealed competing cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathways into two supramolecular polymorphs with entirely different packing structures and UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties. The self&#8208;assembly pathway can be controlled by the cooling rate from a heated solution of the monomers. For both polymorphs, quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions between monomers and the respective aggregates can be established to derive thermodynamic parameters and insights into the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. AFM measurements revealed a nanosheet structure with a height of 2&#8197;nm for the thermodynamically more stable polymorph and a tubular nanorod structure with a helical pitch of 13&#8197;nm and a diameter of 5&#8197;nm for the kinetically favored polymorph. Together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements, packing models were derived: the thermodynamic polymorph consists of brick&#8208;work type nanosheets that exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands as typical for J&#8208;aggregates, while the nanorod polymorph consists of eight supramolecular polymer strands of the bis(squaraine) intertwined to form a chimney&#8208;type tubular structure. The absorption of this aggregate covers a large spectral range from 550 to 875&#8197;nm, which cannot be rationalized by the conventional exciton theory. By applying the Essential States Model and considering intermolecular charge transfer, the aggregate spectrum was adequately reproduced, revealing that the broad absorption spectrum is due to pronounced donor&#8208;acceptor overlap within the bis(squaraine) nanorods. The latter is also responsible for the pronounced bathochromic shift observed for the nanosheet structure as a result of the slip&#8208;stacked arranged squaraine chromophores.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structure Sensitivity of Au&#8208;TiO2 Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions</title>

Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on the Au NP size and the TiO2 facet. Supported Au NPs with a size of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile to undergo the Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, and the TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than the TiO2{101} facets.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate that the Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on both Au nanoparticle (NP) sizes and TiO2 facets. Au NPs of ca. 5&#8197;nm are more facile undergo Au&#8208;TiO2 SMSI than those of ca. 2&#8197;nm, while TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than TiO2{101} facets. The resulting capsulating TiO2&#8722;x overlayers on Au NPs exhibit an average oxidation state between +3 and +4 and a Au&#8208;to&#8208;TiO2&#8722;x charge transfer, which, combined with calculations, determines the Ti:O ratio as ca. 6:11. Both TiO2&#8722;x overlayers and TiO2&#8722;x&#8208;Au interface exhibit easier lattice oxygen activation and higher intrinsic activity in catalyzing low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation than the starting Au&#8208;TiO2 interface. These results advance fundamental understanding of SMSI and demonstrate engineering of metal NP size and oxide facet as an effective strategy to tune the SMSI for efficient catalysis.

A series of neutral coinage&#8208;metal boryl complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The compounds are isoelectronic with alkene complexes, which are crucial intermediates in catalysis. Both the strength of binding and the propensity for deviation toward &#951;1 coordination are more favourable for Au over Ag and Cu.







Abstract
A series of linear late transition metal (M=Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The [B=C]&#8722; moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid&#8208;state, deviation between the &#951;2 and &#951;1 coordination mode occurs. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]&#8722; ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the &#951;1 coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d10 complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the &#960;&#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Total Synthesis of C&#8208;11 Oxygenated Cephalotaxus Alkaloids</title>

A collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids was accomplished. This synthesis features sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective N&#8208;alkylation, a stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. A series of oxidation state adjustments from a common intermediate led to the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids.







Abstract
While numerous studies pertaining to the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus alkaloids have been reported, only two strategies have been reported to date for the successful synthesis of the C&#8208;11 oxygenated subset, due to the additional synthetic challenge posed by the remote C&#8208;11 stereocenter. Herein, we report the collective asymmetric total synthesis of C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids using a chiral proline both as a starting material and as the only chirality source. A tetracyclic advanced intermediate was synthesized in a highly stereoselective manner from l&#8208;proline in 8 steps involving sequential chirality transfer steps such as a diastereoselective N&#8208;alkylation, stereospecific Stevens rearrangement and intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction via an unusual O&#8208;acyloxocarbenium intermediate. From a common intermediate, the asymmetric total synthesis of six C&#8208;11 oxygenated Cephalotaxus alkaloids was completed by a series of oxidation state adjustments.

         <title>Structural and Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Plant Serotonin N&#8208;Acetyltransferase Reveal an Acid/Base&#8208;Assisted Catalysis in Melatonin Biosynthesis</title>

We report the first crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT which exhibit a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold. MD simulations indicated a novel acid/base&#8208;assisted catalysis. The pH and temperature&#8208;depended activity were also shown. This is the first comprehensive study in plant N&#8208;acetyltransferase combining biochemical, structural, and theoretical analysis.







Abstract
Serotonin N&#8208;acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis. It mediates melatonin biosynthesis in plants by using serotonin and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine (5&#8208;MT), but little is known of its underlying mechanisms. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism of a SNAT from Oryza sativa through combined structural and molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. We report the crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT. OsSNAT exhibits a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold not found in the known structures of arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) family. The key residues W188, D189, D226, N220, and Y233 located around the active pocket are important in catalysis, confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Combined with MD simulations, we hypothesize a novel plausible catalytic mechanism in which D226 and Y233 function as catalytic base and acid during the acetyl&#8208;transfer reaction.

     alt="Structural and Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Plant Serotonin N&#8208;Acetyltransferase Reveal an Acid/Base&#8208;Assisted Catalysis in Melatonin Biosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the first crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT which exhibit a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold. MD simulations indicated a novel acid/base&#8208;assisted catalysis. The pH and temperature&#8208;depended activity were also shown. This is the first comprehensive study in plant &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;acetyltransferase combining biochemical, structural, and theoretical analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin N&#8208;acetyltransferase (SNAT) is the key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis. It mediates melatonin biosynthesis in plants by using serotonin and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine (5&#8208;MT), but little is known of its underlying mechanisms. Herein, we present a detailed reaction mechanism of a SNAT from Oryza sativa through combined structural and molecular dynamics (MD) analysis. We report the crystal structures of plant SNAT in the apo and binary/ternary complex forms with acetyl&#8208;CoA (AcCoA), serotonin, and 5&#8208;MT. OsSNAT exhibits a unique enzymatically active dimeric fold not found in the known structures of arylalkylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase (AANAT) family. The key residues W188, D189, D226, N220, and Y233 located around the active pocket are important in catalysis, confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. Combined with MD simulations, we hypothesize a novel plausible catalytic mechanism in which D226 and Y233 function as catalytic base and acid during the acetyl&#8208;transfer reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hole&#8208;Storage Enhanced a&#8208;Si Photocathodes for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>

An outstanding PEC performance of amorphous silicon photocathode is reported with a record 15.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, the maximum ABPE of 4.08&#8201;%, and a sustained operation for 175&#8197;min for hydrogen production with 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency in harsh alkaline media. This remarkable performance is made possible by ferrihydrite interfacial engineering which facilitates the electron transfer to the surface Ni cocatalyst but blocks the holes.







Abstract
Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated as an effective interfacial layer for photoanodes to achieve outstanding photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance for water oxidation reaction owing to its unique hole&#8208;storage function. However, it is unknown whether such a hole&#8208;storage layer can be used to construct highly efficient photocathodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we report Fh interfacial engineering of amorphous silicon photocathode (with nickel as HER cocatalyst) achieving a photocurrent density of 15.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode and a half&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 4.08&#8201;% in alkaline solution, outperforming most of reported a&#8208;Si based photocathodes including multi&#8208;junction configurations integrated with noble metal cocatalysts in acid solution. Besides, the photocurrent density is maintained above 14&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 175&#8197;min with 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for HER in alkaline solution. Our results demonstrate a feasible approach to construct efficient photocathodes via the application of a hole&#8208;storage layer.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Bioconjugation with Bifunctional Palladium Reagents</title>

Linking life's molecules: Rapid and site&#8208;selective oligonucleotide bioconjugation via bifunctional oxidative addition complexes (OACs) is reported. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate isolable oligonucleotide OACs. Within minutes, the oligonucleotide OACs undergo a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;S arylation reaction with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules.







Abstract
Organometallic reagents enable practical strategies for bioconjugation. Innovations in the design of water&#8208;soluble ligands and the enhancement of reaction rates have allowed for chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling reactions of peptides and proteins to be carried out in water. There are currently no organometallic&#8208;based methods for oligonucleotide bioconjugation to other biomolecules. Here we report bifunctional palladium(II)&#8208;oxidative addition complexes (OACs) as reagents for high&#8208;yielding oligonucleotide bioconjugation reactions. These bifunctional OACs react chemoselectively with amine&#8208;modified oligonucleotides to generate the first isolable, bench stable oligonucleotide&#8208;palladium(II) OACs. These complexes undergo site&#8208;selective C&#8208;S arylation with a broad range of native thiol&#8208;containing biomolecules at low micromolar concentrations in under one hour. This approach provided oligonucleotide&#8208;peptide, oligonucleotide&#8208;protein, oligonucleotide&#8208;small molecule, and oligonucleotide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates in &gt;80&#8201;% yield and afforded conjugation of multiple copies of oligonucleotides onto a monoclonal antibody.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Quality Control Assay for the Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries of Macrocycles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11983-11990, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The creation of high&#8208;quality libraries of macrocycles from conformationally restricted precursors is a challenge due to the variable cyclization rates of different linear molecules. Here we report a powerful assay for on&#8208;resin analysis of the cyclization efficiency of thousands of non&#8208;peptidic thioether macrocycles in the context of a DNA&#8208;encoded library.







Abstract
There is considerable interest in the development of libraries of scaffold&#8208;diverse macrocycles as a source of ligands for difficult targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interaction surfaces. A classic problem in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality macrocyclic libraries is that some linear precursors will cyclize efficiently while some will not, depending on their conformational preferences. We report here a powerful quality control method that can be employed to readily distinguish between scaffolds that do and do not cyclize efficiently during solid&#8208;phase synthesis of thioether macrocycles without the need for tedious liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. We demonstrate that this assay can be employed to identify linear impurities in a DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocycles. We also use the method to establish a useful quality control protocol for re&#8208;synthesis of putative macrocyclic screening hits.

         <title>Evidence of the Lewis&#8208;Amphoteric Character of Tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide, [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 12124-12131, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable salts of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; ion were isolated utilizing sterically demanding phosphazenium cations. Similar to Lewis amphoteric silylenes, the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; ion activates CO2 and adds side&#8208;on to CS2 allowing novel negatively charged species like 2 and 3 to be structurally characterized.







Abstract
According to a first view on the geometrical and electronic structure of the tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanide, this anion appears as a Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations on perfluoroalkylated silanides show significantly lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels in comparison to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, which implies reduced Lewis basicity and increased Lewis acidity of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; ion. With these findings and a HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap of 4.80&#8197;eV similar to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes (NHSis), perfluoroalkyl silanides are predestined to exhibit Lewis&#8208;amphoteric character similar to silylenes. Deprotonation of Si(C2F5)3H with sterically demanding phosphazene bases afforded thermally stable phosphazenium salts of the [Si(C2F5)3]&#8722; anion, which add to benzaldehyde, benzophenone, CS2, and CO2 in various manners. This behavior also mirrors the reactivity of silylenes towards ketones as well as heterocumulenes and is rationalized by Lewis amphotericity being inherent in these silanides.

Deprotonation of Si(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H with sterically demanding phosphazene bases afforded thermally stable phosphazenium salts of the [Si(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion, which add to benzaldehyde, benzophenone, CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in various manners. This behavior also mirrors the reactivity of silylenes towards ketones as well as heterocumulenes and is rationalized by Lewis amphotericity being inherent in these silanides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>When Fluxionality Beats Size Selection: Acceleration of Ostwald Ripening of Sub&#8208;Nano Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11973-11982, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For supported nanoclusters at typical catalytic temperatures, Ostwald ripening is strongly accelerated by structural fluxionality, even in the regime of cluster size&#8208;selection. Hence, a revision of the theory of Ostwald ripening is proposed.







Abstract
Size selection was demonstrated to suppress Ostwald ripening of supported catalytic nanoparticles. When the supported clusters are subnanometer in size and highly fluxional, such as Pt clusters on the rutile TiO2(110) surface, this paradigm breaks down, and the established theory of sintering needs a revision. At temperatures characteristic of catalysis (i.e. 700&#8197;K), sub&#8208;nano clusters thermally populate many low&#8208;energy metastable isomers. As these isomers all have different geometric and electronic structures, and thus, formation and dissociation energies (in lieu of surface energy), Ostwald ripening is not suppressed, despite the size&#8208;selection. However, some clusters arise as magic numbers in terms of sintering stability at the ensemble level. Acceleration of sintering by metastable species persists though weakens in polydisperse cluster systems. We propose a competing pathways theory for sintering, which at the atomistic level describes the found size&#8208;specific sintering behavior.

Microwave assisted synthesis is applied to prepare a dysprosium 2D&#8208;MOF with simple carboxylato ligands, [Dy(MeCOO)(PhCOO)2]n (1). The Dy(3+) ions are arranged into nanosheets in a hexagonal pattern, stacked by van der Waals forces similar to those of graphene. The magnetically diluted MOF 1&#8201;d is a bifunctional 2D luminescent material with SIM properties.







Abstract
We report the microwave assisted synthesis of a bidimensional (2D) MOF of formula [Dy(MeCOO)(PhCOO)2]n (1) and its magnetically diluted analogue [La0.9Dy0.1(MeCOO)(PhCOO)2] (1&#8201;d). 1 is a 2D material with single&#8208;ion&#8208;magnet (SIM) behaviour and 1&#8201;d is a multifunctional, magnetic and luminescent 2D material. 1 can be exfoliated into stable nanosheets by sonication.

The solvent&#8208;switched hydroxylation and oxygenation of &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated carbanions with molecular oxygen under mild conditions are reported, delivering various useful &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated alcohols and ketones in high yields. The solvent&#8208;bonding effect tames the redox reactions of the hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfide intermediates, and alters their reactivity and switches the oxidation selectivities.







Abstract
The solvent&#8208;switched hydroxylation and oxygenation of &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated carbanions with molecular oxygen under mild conditions are reported. This strategy tames the redox reactions of the in situ generated hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfides, in which solvent&#8208;bonding can alter their reactivity and switch the oxidation selectivities. These controllable three&#8208;component reactions of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, thiols and molecular oxygen afford various useful &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated alcohols and ketones in high yields. Significantly, this protocol has been applied in the synthesis different bioactive molecules. Mechanism studies enable the detection of the hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfide intermediates and exclude the thiol&#8208;based radical pathway.

We report rotaxanes containing a carbazole&#8208;containing TADF luminophore in which the mechanical bond improves key photophysical properties, including the photoluminescence quantum yield and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest this is due to weak interactions between the axle and macrocycle, enforced by the mechanical bond.







Abstract
We report the characterization of rotaxanes based on a carbazole&#8208;benzophenone thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminophore. We find that the mechanical bond leads to an improvement in key photophysical properties of the emitter, notably an increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and a decrease in the energy difference between singlet and triplet states, as well as fine tuning of the emission wavelength, a feat that is difficult to achieve when using covalently bound substituents. Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest that this tuning of properties occurs due to weak interactions between the axle and the macrocycle that are enforced by the mechanical bond. This work highlights the benefits of using the mechanical bond to refine existing luminophores, providing a new avenue for emitter optimization that can ultimately increase the performance of these molecules.

         <title>Non&#8208;oxidative Coupling of Methane: N&#8208;type Doping of Niobium Single Atoms in TiO2&#8211;SiO2 Induces Electron Localization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11901-11909, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type doped macro/mesoporous TiO2&#8211;SiO2 was synthesized and applied to the photocatalytic NOCM. The n&#8208;type doping results in electronic localization in the neighborhood of Nb, which facilitates the activation of CH4 and the desorption of C2H6. More active sites formed from Nb doping and the facilitated adsorption&#8208;activation&#8208;coupling&#8208;desorption process finally result in the high activity of Nb&#8211;TS.







Abstract
Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) is an attractive potential way to use abundant methane resources. Herein, an n&#8208;type doped photocatalyst for NOCM is created by doping single&#8208;atom Nb into hierarchical porous TiO2&#8211;SiO2 (TS) microarray, which exhibits a high conversion rate of 3.57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with good recyclability. The Nb dopant replaces the 6&#8208;coordinated titanium on the (1 0 1) plane and forms shallow electron&#8208;trapped surface polarons along [0 1 0] direction and the comparison of different models proves that the electron localization caused by the n&#8208;type doping is beneficial to both methane activation and ethane desorption. The positive effect of n&#8208;type dopant on CH4 conversion is further verified on Mo&#8208;, W&#8208; and Ta&#8208;doped composites. In contrast, the doping of p&#8208;type dopant (Ga, Cu, Fe) shows a less active influence.

     alt="Non&#8208;oxidative Coupling of Methane: N&#8208;type Doping of Niobium Single Atoms in TiO2&#8211;SiO2 Induces Electron Localization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;type doped macro/mesoporous TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was synthesized and applied to the photocatalytic NOCM. The n&#8208;type doping results in electronic localization in the neighborhood of Nb, which facilitates the activation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the desorption of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. More active sites formed from Nb doping and the facilitated adsorption&#8208;activation&#8208;coupling&#8208;desorption process finally result in the high activity of Nb&#8211;TS.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>New Aldehyde&#8208;Functional Methacrylic Water&#8208;Soluble Polymers</title>

A water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer (AGEO5MA) was prepared by oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT aqueous polymerization yielded PAGEO5MA homopolymer, which was oxidized using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios to yield hydrophilic statistical copolymers with cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups. Three PGEO5MA&#8208;based diblock copolymers were converted into aldehyde&#8208;functional copolymers, which were derivatized with amino acids.







Abstract
Aldehyde groups enable facile conjugation to proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides or fluorescent dyes, yet there are no literature examples of water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional vinyl monomers. We report the synthesis of a new hydrophilic cis&#8208;diol&#8208;based methacrylic monomer (GEO5MA) by transesterification of isopropylideneglycerol penta(ethylene glycol) using methyl methacrylate followed by acetone deprotection via acid hydrolysis. The corresponding water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer, AGEO5MA, is prepared by aqueous periodate oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT polymerization of GEO5MA yields the water&#8208;soluble homopolymer, PGEO5MA. Aqueous periodate oxidation of the terminal cis&#8208;diol units on PGEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C affords a water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional homopolymer (PAGEO5MA). Moreover, a library of hydrophilic statistical copolymers bearing cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups was prepared using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios. The aldehyde groups on PAGEO5MA homopolymer were reacted in turn with three amino acids to demonstrate synthetic utility.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;Amino&#8208;Esters by Cooperative Isothiourea and Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and effective catalytic enantioselective approach to &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;amino esters is demonstrated and applied to the synthesis of (S)&#8208;Venlafaxine&#8901;HCl and (S)&#8208;Nakinadine&#8197;B. Mechanistic investigations support a C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate pathway with reversible isothiourea addition to an in&#8197;situ generated iminium ion leading to an off&#8208;cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;amino esters through enantioselective aminomethylation of an arylacetic acid ester in high yields and enantioselectivity via cooperative isothiourea and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis is demonstrated. The scope and limitations of this process are explored (25 examples, up to 94&#8201;% yield and 96:4 er), with applications to the synthesis of (S)&#8208;Venlafaxine&#8901;HCl and (S)&#8208;Nakinadine&#8197;B. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate pathway being followed rather than an alternative dynamic kinetic resolution process. Control studies indicate that (i) a linear effect between catalyst and product er is observed; (ii) an acyl ammonium ion can be used as a precatalyst; (iii) reversible isothiourea addition to an in situ generated iminium ion leads to an off&#8208;cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Self&#8208;Assembly Changes its Course: A Leap from Simple Polymers to 3D&#8197;Networks of Spherical Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies</title>

A discontinuous switch in the three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly between [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)], AgSbF6, and NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) from simple coordination polymers to polycationic host&#8211;guest assemblies connected by dinitrile linkers was discovered. In addition to diverse 1D&#8211;3D coordination polymers, two different types of host&#8211;guest complexes were obtained, embedded in a 3D&#8197;polymeric network.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly reactions of the polyphosphorus complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (A), a coinage metal salt AgSbF6, and flexible aliphatic dinitriles NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) yield 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination polymers. The seven&#8208;membered backbone of the dinitrile was experimentally found as the borderline for the self&#8208;assembly system furnishing products of different kinds. At x&lt;7, various rather simple polymers are exclusively formed possessing either 0D or 1D Ag/A structural motifs connected by dinitrile spacers, while at x&#8805;7, the self&#8208;assembly switches to unprecedented extraordinary 3D&#8197;networks of nano&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest assemblies (SbF6)@[(A)9Ag11]11+ (x=7) or (A)@[(A)12Ag12]12+ (x=8&#8211;10) linked by dinitriles. The polycationic nodes represent the first superspheres based on A and silver and are host&#8211;guest able. All products are characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The assemblies [(A)12Ag12]12+ were visualized by transmission electron microscopy.

         <title>What Shall We Do with the Computed Detonation Performance? Comment on &#8220;1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level&#8221;</title>

Abstract
In this Correspondence, a question is raised on how confident are the computed detonation performance values. Consideration of the energetic materials in a recent Research Article in this journal and some other newly synthesized promising compounds shows that the variation between the available methods of calculation is surprisingly high.

Abstract
The values obtained for detonation performance are a function of the computational methods utilized. Since there are many such methods, the literature may contain a range of values for a single compound.

Supramolecular polymorphism for bis(squaraine) dye aggregates is described by David Bialas, Kazunori Sugiyasu, Frank W&#252;rthner, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;11949. This bis(squaraine) self&#8208;assembles into helical nanorods in solution upon rapid cooling, while slow cooling results in thermodynamically stable nanosheet structures. The two polymorphs exhibit entirely different UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties with panchromatic features for the nanorods, while a narrow, bathochromically shifted J&#8208;band is observed for the nanosheets.

A selective grafting route for heterometallic MOFs is described by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;11868. The different chemistry of Ti(IV) and Ca(II) sites is used to direct selective coordination of amines to the latter. This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available &#8208;NH2 sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Transition Metal Complexes as Catalysts for the Electroconversion of CO2: An Organometallic Perspective</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11628-11686, May 17, 2021. </description>

This review article illustrates and categorizes the currently favored molecular mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The resulting insights are corroborated by the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic transformation of carbon dioxide has been a topic of interest in the field of CO2 utilization for a long time. Recently, the area has seen increasing dynamics as an alternative strategy to catalytic hydrogenation for CO2 reduction. While many studies focus on the direct electron transfer to the CO2 molecule at the electrode material, molecular transition metal complexes in solution offer the possibility to act as catalysts for the electron transfer. C1 compounds such as carbon monoxide, formate, and methanol are often targeted as the main products, but more elaborate transformations are also possible within the coordination sphere of the metal center. This perspective article will cover selected examples to illustrate and categorize the currently favored mechanisms for the electrochemically induced transformation of CO2 promoted by homogeneous transition metal complexes. The insights will be corroborated with the concepts and elementary steps of organometallic catalysis to derive potential strategies to broaden the molecular diversity of possible products.

         <title>An Area&#8208;Specific, International Community&#8208;Led Approach to Understanding and Addressing Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Issues within Supramolecular Chemistry</title>

Marginalisation can be experienced for many intersectional reasons including race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and gender. This Essay sets out a field&#8208;specific approach to supporting equality, diversity, and inclusion in supramolecular chemistry as pioneered by an international network of Women In Supramolecular Chemistry (WISC). WISC aims to &#8220;call in&#8221; the community and to use qualitative approaches to set out a framework for addressing EDI.







Abstract
Diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI/EDI) are pressing issues in chemistry and the natural sciences. In this Essay we share how an area&#8208;specific approach is &#8220;calling in&#8221; the community so that it can act to address EDI issues, and support those who are marginalised. Women In Supramolecular Chemistry (WISC) is an international network that aims to support equality, diversity, and inclusion within supramolecular chemistry. WISC has taken a field&#8208;specific approach using qualitative research methods with scientists to identify the support that is needed and the problems the supramolecular community needs to address. Herein, we present survey data from the community which highlight the barriers that are faced by those who take career breaks for any reason, a common example is maternity leave, and the importance of mentoring to aid progression post&#8208;PhD. In conclusion, we set out an interdisciplinary and creative approach to addressing EDI issues within supramolecular chemistry.

Dynamic self&#8208;assembly of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles at Gibbs monolayers, i.e., air&#8211;water interfaces, and in solutions, ranging from isotropic assembly transformations to anisotropic three&#8208;dimensional structures, provides the amplification of molecular motion to macroscopic functions.







Abstract
Amphiphilic molecules, comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and the intrinsic propensity to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous environment, sustain a fascinating spectrum of structures and functions ranging from biological membranes to ordinary soap. Facing the challenge to design responsive, adaptive, and out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in water, the incorporation of photoresponsive motifs in amphiphilic molecular structures offers ample opportunity to design supramolecular systems that enables functional responses in water in a non&#8208;invasive way using light. Here, we discuss the design of photoresponsive molecular amphiphiles, their self&#8208;assembled structures in aqueous media and at air&#8211;water interfaces, and various approaches to arrive at adaptive and dynamic functions in isotropic and anisotropic systems, including motion at the air&#8211;water interface, foam formation, reversible nanoscale assembly, and artificial muscle function. Controlling the delicate interplay of structural design, self&#8208;assembling conditions and external stimuli, these responsive amphiphiles open several avenues towards application such as soft adaptive materials, controlled delivery or soft actuators, bridging a gap between artificial and natural dynamic systems.

Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites such as the easily synthesized double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 have generated great attention as promising alternatives to lead&#8208;based counterparts. This Minireview takes a close look at Cs2AgInCl6 materials in the form of bulk crystals as well as nanocrystals in terms of doping engineering, photoluminescence modification, and fundamental theoretical understanding.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have drawn wide attention as alternatives to their toxic and poorly stable lead&#8208;based counterparts. Among them, double perovskites with Cs2AgInCl6 composition, often doped with various elements, have been in the spotlight owing to their intriguing optical properties, namely, self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards both crystals and nanocrystals, and the exploration of many alloy compositions with mono&#8208; and trivalent cations other than Ag+ and In3+. In this Minireview we describe the recent developments on Cs2AgInCl6 bulk crystals and nanocrystals, their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties, and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects. We also discuss progress on computational studies aimed at understanding the thermodynamic stability, the role of defects, and the origin of photoluminescence in relation to the STEs and the direct band gap character.

         <title>Synthetic DNA for Cell&#8208;Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11580-11591, May 17, 2021. </description>

State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods for using DNA to engineer cell surfaces on both a monovalent and polyvalent scale are introduced in this Minireview. The application of these methods for either the promotion or inhibition of cell&#8211;environment communication in different settings is also described.







Abstract
The cell membrane is not only a physical barrier, but also a functional organelle that regulates the communication between a cell and its environment. The ability to functionalize the cell membrane with synthetic molecules or nanostructures would advance cellular functions beyond what evolution has provided. The aim of this Minireview is to introduce recent progress in using synthetic DNA and DNA&#8208;based nanostructures for cell&#8208;surface engineering. We first introduce chemical conjugation and physical binding methods for monovalent and polyvalent surface engineering. We then introduce the application of these methods for either the promotion or inhibition of cell&#8211;environment communication in numerous applications, including the promotion of cell&#8211;cell recognition, regulation of intracellular pathways, protection of therapeutic cells, and sensing of the intracellular and extracellular microenvironments. Lastly, we summarize current challenges existing in this area and potential solutions to solve these challenges.

         <title>Endogenous Symbiotic Li3N/Cellulose Skin to Extend the Cycle Life of Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11718-11724, May 17, 2021. </description>

An effective electrolyte was designed via adding nitrocellulose (NC) in ether electrolyte to form an endogenous symbiotic Li3N/cellulose double solid electrolyte interphase (ES&#8208;DSEI) on Li surface. An ES&#8208;DSEI with a uniform dual&#8208;layer provides excellent chemical and physical stability and high ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Nitrocellulose (NC) is proposed to stabilize the electrolytes for Li metal batteries. The nitro group of NC preferentially reacts with Li metal, and along with the cellulose skeleton is tightly wrapped on the surface, so that the polymer&#8211;inorganic double layer is formed on the Li surface. XPS profile analysis and corroborative cryo&#8208;environmental TEM reveal that the flexible outer layer of the bilayer is a C&#8208;O organic layer, while the dense inner layer is mainly composed of crystalline lithium oxide, lithium oxynitride, and lithium nitride. The Li deposition process was observed via in situ optical microscopy, which indicated that the NC&#8208;derived bilayer facilitates the uniform deposition of Li ions and inhibits the growth of dendrites. After the introduction of NC into the electrolyte, the cycle life of the Li battery is twice than that of the Li battery without NC at 1.0 and 3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Direct Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H and Vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H Thiolation with Hydrogen Evolution by Quantum Dots and Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11779-11783, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic thiolation of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H or vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H with thiol S&#8722;H is reported for the first time. The radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H or vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H with thiol S&#8722;H is achieved with liberation of H2. Such a unique transformation opens up a door toward direct cross&#8208;coupling of C&#8722;H and S&#8722;H bonds in valuable organosulfur chemistry.







Abstract
Direct allylic C&#8722;H thiolation is straightforward for allylic C(sp3)&#8722;S bond formation. However, strong interactions between thiol and transition metal catalysts lead to deactivation of the catalytic cycle or oxidation of sulfur atom under oxidative condition. Thus, direct allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H thiolation has proved difficult. Represented herein is an exceptional for direct, efficient, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic thiolation of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H and thiol S&#8722;H under visible light irradiation. Radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy identified the allylic radical and thiyl radical generated on the surface of photocatalyst quantum dots (QDs). The C&#8722;S bond formation does not require external oxidants and radical initiators, and hydrogen (H2) is produced as byproduct. When vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H was used instead of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, the radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling of C(sp2)&#8722;H and S&#8722;H was achieved with liberation of H2. Such a unique transformation opens up a door toward direct C&#8722;H and S&#8722;H coupling for valuable organosulfur chemistry.

A highly modular, site&#8208;selective 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated olefins en route to versatile bis&#8208;organometallic B,B(Si)&#8208;reagents was developed by nickel catalyzed chain&#8208;walking events.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Emission from Off&#8208;Gases of Steel Industry by Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11852-11857, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of a novel process is presented for the reduction of CO2 emissions occurring in the steel industry. The potential of using off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace for the dry reforming of the CH4 to valuable syngas is investigated theoretically and experimentally. A maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% was achieved at conditions relevant for the steel industry.







Abstract
In a novel process, CO2 and CH4 from the off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace are used in homogeneous reforming of those greenhouse gases to valuable syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. Synthetic mixtures of the off&#8208;gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% could be achieved at 1350&#8201;&#176;C, 5.5&#8197;bar, and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary&#8208;step reaction mechanism.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Ketones</title>

Strain&#8208;release driven spirocyclization: The expedient and modular construction of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles harnessing the strain energy of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment is described. From easily accessible ABB&#8208;ketones, electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization gives access to a range of spiro&#8208;azetidines with varying functionalities and ring sizes.







Abstract
Due to their intrinsic rigidity, three&#8208;dimensionality and structural novelty, spirocyclic molecules have become increasingly sought&#8208;after moieties in drug discovery. Herein, we report a strain&#8208;release driven synthesis of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles by harnessing the inherent ring strain of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment. Novel ABB&#8208;ketone precursors bearing silyl&#8208;protected alcohols were synthesized in a single step and shown to engage in electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization&#8208;desilylation reactions. Primary, secondary and tertiary silyl ethers were effectively transformed into a library of new spiro&#8208;azetidines, with a range of substituents and ring sizes. In addition, the products are generated with synthetically useful ketone and protected&#8208;amine functional groups, which provides the potential for further elaboration and for this chemistry to be utilized in the rapid assembly of medicinally relevant compounds.

The thickness of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) layer can be modulated by rationally regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or co&#8208;reactant to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions, thus allowing the spatially selective ECL imaging of cell&#8211;matrix adhesions at the bottom and cell&#8211;cell junctions near the apical surface of cells.







Abstract
Cell junctions are protein structures located at specific cell membrane domains that determine key processes in multicellular development. Here we report spatially selective imaging of cell junctions by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or co&#8208;reactant, the thickness of ECL layer can be controlled to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions. At a low concentration of luminophore, ECL generation is confined to the electrode surface, thus revealing only cell&#8211;matrix adhesions at the bottom of cells. While at a high concentration of luminophore, the ECL layer can be remarkably extended by decreasing the co&#8208;reactant concentration, thus allowing the sequential imaging of cell&#8211;matrix and cell&#8211;cell junctions at the bottom and near the apical surface of cells, respectively. This strategy not only provides new insights into the ECL mechanisms but also promises wide applications of ECL microscopy in bioimaging.

         <title>FRET Modulated Signaling: A Versatile Strategy to Construct Photoelectrochemical Microsensors for In Vivo Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11774-11778, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imbedding a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system into a photoactive material is a versatile strategy to construct highly selective PEC sensors for diverse targets, no matter electroactive or electrochemically non&#8208;active. Such a FRET modulated PEC microsensor is able to monitor in situ neurochemicals in the brain.







Abstract
Microelectrode&#8208;based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non&#8208;active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO2, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as&#8208;fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It can monitor fluctuations of SO2 levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion and febrile seizure. More significantly, such a FRET modulated signaling strategy can be extended to diverse analytes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microelectrode&#8208;based electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensors are promising candidates for in vivo analysis of biologically important chemicals. However, limited selectivity in complicated biological systems and poor adaptability to electrochemically non&#8208;active species restrained their applications. Herein, we propose the concept of modulating the PEC output by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The emission of energy donor was dependent on the concentration of target SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn served as the modulator of the photocurrent signal of the photoactive material. The employment of optical modulation circumvented the problem of selectivity, and the as&#8208;fabricated PEC microelectrode showed good stability and reproducibility in vivo. It can monitor fluctuations of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in brains of rat models of cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion and febrile seizure. More significantly, such a FRET modulated signaling strategy can be extended to diverse analytes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination from Low ee Compounds by the Crystalline Sponge Method. Unusual Conglomerate Formation in a Pre&#8208;Determined Crystalline Lattice</title>

No need for ee enrichment: When a low ee chiral compound (even 17&#8201;% ee!) is absorbed into the pre&#8208;determined crystalline lattice of the crystalline sponge, the analyte forms an enantiomerically pure [RmSn] aggregate, validating the Bijvoet method for the absolute structure analysis with a reasonable Flack (Parsons) parameter value.







Abstract
When chiral compounds with low enantiomeric excess (ee, R:S=m:n) were absorbed into the void of the crystalline sponge (CS), enantiomerically pure [(R)m(S)n] chiral composites were formed, changing the centrosymmetric space group into non&#8208;centrosymmetric one. The absolute configuration of the analyte compounds was elucidated with a reasonable Flack (Parsons) parameter value. This phenomenon is characteristic to the &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; in the pre&#8208;determined CS crystalline lattice, seldom found in common crystallization where the crystalline lattice is defined by an analyte itself. The results highlight the potential of the CS method for absolute configuration determination of low ee samples, an often encountered situation in asymmetric synthesis studies.

         <title>A Molecular Transformer: A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycle as an Adaptable Host</title>

Molecular Transformer: A flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated, all carbon&#8208;based &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221; macrocycle (3) without a meso bridge was synthesized in one step. The supramolecular assembly behavior of 3 was investigated in this work; compared to the rigid conformation of dimer 1, the structure of tetramer 3 is more flexible due to its larger ring size, which endows it with the ability to adjust its conformation according to changes in the external environment.







Abstract
Here, we report a facile method to synthesize a series of macrocycles with different conformations. The planar macrocycle dimer (1), twisted macrocycle trimer (2) and &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221; tetramer (3) are clearly elucidated by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis, in which the electron&#8208;rich phenanthrene units offer the possibility of supramolecular assembly. As expected, in the solid state, 1 and 3 assemble into a columnar stack and an interlocking dimer, respectively, via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the phenanthrene units. Compared to the rigid conformation of dimer 1, the structure of tetramer 3 is more flexible due to its enlarged ring size. 3 can deform from a figure&#8208;eight into a boat&#8208;shaped geometry to host a planar electron&#8208;deficient guest using its electron&#8208;rich phenanthrene units. When assembled with spherical electron&#8208;deficient C60, interestingly, 3 further undergoes a conformational transformation from a figure&#8208;eight to a belt shape in order to host C60. These supramolecular assembly behaviors of 3 demonstrate that it is an adaptable macrocyclic host for both planar molecules and fullerenes.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Methylation of Alkyl Iodides with CO as the C1 Source: Advantaged by Faster Reaction of CuH over CuBpin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11730-11734, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source is reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.







Abstract
CuH and CuBpin are versatile catalysts and intermediates in organic chemistry. However, studies that involve both CuH and CuBpin in the same reaction is still rarely reported due to their high reactivity. Now, a study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source is reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Practical Separation of Cyclic and Linear Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11830-11834, May 17, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can discriminate topological architectures of macromolecules, such as linear and cyclic structures, via selective polymer insertion into the nanopores. This realizes new polymer separation technology that enables practical and efficient isolation of cyclic polyethylene glycols (PEGs) from the chaotic mixture with linear impurities in a gram scale.







Abstract
The purification step in the manufacturing of cyclic polymers is difficult as complete fractionation to eliminate linear impurities requires considerable effort. Here, we report a new polymer separation methodology that uses metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to discriminate between linear and cyclic polyethylene glycols (PEGs) via selective polymer insertion into the MOF nanopores. Preparation of a MOF&#8208;packed column allowed analytical and preparative chromatographic separation of these topologically distinct pairs. In addition, gram&#8208;scale PEGs with only cyclic structures were successfully obtained from a crude reaction mixture by using MOF as an adsorbent.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Interaction Modulation in Porous Coordination Polymers for Inverse Selective CO2/C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11688-11694, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity is achieved through precise steric design of amino groups in the pore surface to provide enhanced CO2&#8211;framework interactions and suppressed C2H2 adsorption. The obtained two new porous coordination polymers (PCPs) exhibit high CO2 uptake and strong separation performance for one&#8208;step C2H2 purification at room temperature, which can be considered as new physisorbents with this specific inverse selectivity.







Abstract
Controlling gas sorption by simple pore modification is important in molecular recognition and industrial separation processes. In particular, it is challenging to realize the inverse selectivity, which reduces the adsorption of a high&#8208;affinity gas and increases the adsorption of a low&#8208;affinity gas. Herein, an &#8220;opposite action&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for boosting CO2/C2H2 selectivity in porous coordination polymers (PCPs). A precise steric design of channel pores using an amino group as an additional interacting site enabled the synergetic increase in CO2 adsorption while suppressing the C2H2 adsorption. Based on this strategy, two new ultramicroporous PCP physisorbents that are isostructural were synthesised. They exhibited the highest CO2 uptake and CO2/C2H2 volume uptake ratio at 298&#8197;K. Origin of this specific selectivity was verified by detailed density functional theory calculations. The breakthrough separation performances with remarkable stability and recyclability of both the PCPs render them relevant materials for C2H2 purification from CO2/C2H2 mixtures.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Induced Spin Changes in Fe/N/C Electrocatalysts Assessed by In Situ X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11707-11712, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The needed improvements in the activity and stability of Fe/N/C&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the reduction of oxygen or carbon dioxide require a better understanding of their active sites&#8217; structure and electronic properties. To this end, herein we have applied ex situ and in situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy to track the potential&#8208;induced changes in the average spin state of these materials&#8217; molecular Fe&#8208;Nx sites.







Abstract
The commercial success of the electrochemical energy conversion technologies required for the decarbonization of the energy sector requires the replacement of the noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts currently used in (co&#8208;)electrolyzers and fuel cells with inexpensive, platinum&#8208;group metal&#8208;free analogs. Among these, Fe/N/C&#8208;type catalysts display promising performances for the reduction of O2 or CO2, but their insufficient activity and stability jeopardize their implementation in such devices. To circumvent these issues, a better understanding of the local geometric and electronic structure of their catalytic active sites under reaction conditions is needed. Herein we shed light on the electronic structure of the molecular sites in two Fe/N/C catalysts by probing their average spin state with X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES). Chiefly, our in situ XES measurements reveal for the first time the existence of reversible, potential&#8208;induced spin state changes in these materials.

         <title>Ligand Non&#8208;innocence and Single Molecular Spintronic Properties of AgII Dibenzocorrole Radical on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11702-11706, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dibenzo&#8208;fused silver corrole (Ag&#8208;1) was synthesized and its electronic state on Ag(111) substrate was studied by STM. Ag&#8208;1 adopted an unprecedented domed geometry with two orientations. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center, were observed by STS, which provide the first spectroscopic evidence for open&#8208;shell AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722;.







Abstract
A facile method for the quantitative preparation of silver dibenzo&#8208;fused corrole Ag&#8208;1 is described. In contrast to the saddle conformation resolved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis for Ag&#8208;1, it adopts an unprecedented domed geometry, with up and down orientations, when adsorbed on an Ag(111) surface. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center were observed by cryogenic STM, with relatively high Kondo temperature (172&#8197;K), providing evidence for a non&#8208;innocent AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722; species. Further investigation validates that benzene ring fusion and molecule&#8208;substrate interactions play pivotal roles in enhancing Ag(4d(x2&#8722;y2))&#8211;corrole (&#960;) orbital interactions, thereby stabilizing the open&#8208;shell singlet AgII&#8208;corrole.2&#8722; on Ag(111) surface. Moreover, this strategy used for constructing metal&#8208;free benzene&#8208;ring fused corrole ligand gives rise to inspiration of designing novel metal&#8211;corrole compound for multichannel molecular spintronics devices.

         <title>Uncovering a Functional Motif of Nonlinear Optical Materials by In Situ Electron Density and Wavefunction Studies Under Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11799-11803, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy of determining nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motif (FM) is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. In situ ED analysis is firstly adopted for an NLO material with typical LiB3O5 as an example. The work extracts the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.







Abstract
Exploring nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motifs (FM, the structural origin of NLO efficiency) is vital for the rational design of NLO materials. Normal spectrum techniques applied in studying photon exciting materials are invalid for NLO materials, in which electrons are not excited substantially but only distorted under laser. A general strategy of determining NLO FM is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. The in situ experimental ED and wavefunction of typical NLO material LiB3O5 (LBO) under dark and 360 and 1064&#8197;nm lasers are investigated. Compared with the initial state under dark, the ED of [B3O5]&#8722; unit at functional states under laser irradiation exhibits remarkable changes of topological atomic and bond properties, confirming the NLO FM being [B3O5]&#8722;. The work extracts for the first time the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.

Compared with the initial state under dark, the ED of [B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; unit at functional states under laser irradiation exhibits remarkable changes of topological atomic and bond properties, confirming the NLO FM being [B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The work extracts for the first time the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of in situ ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stereoselective Diboration of Spirocyclobutenes: A Platform for the Synthesis of Spirocycles with Orthogonal Exit Vectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11763-11768, May 17, 2021. </description>

Spirocyclobutenes provide a platform for the preparation of chiral spirocycles, through the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective diboration of the double bond. Selective manipulation of the boryl moieties in the products allows unique control on the directionality and nature of the substituents on the spirocycle framework.







Abstract
The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective diboration of spirocyclobutenes provides a platform for the rapid preparation of a wide variety of chiral spirocyclic building blocks. The chemoselective functionalization of the carbon&#8208;boron bond in the products, including a stereospecific sp3&#8208;sp2 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction, provides a powerful tool to control the directionality and the nature of the exit vectors in the spirocyclic framework.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Nanoparticles with Programable Intermolecular Charge Transfer for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11758-11762, May 17, 2021. </description>

Organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CT NPs) with programmable absorption can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II regions via donor and acceptor engineering. CT NPs with red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040&#8197;nm achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm excitation, and thus effectively kill both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under 1064&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Extensive recent efforts have been put on the design of high&#8208;performance organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs), especially over NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;window (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). So far, the development is mainly limited by the rarity of molecules with good NIR&#8208;II response. Here, we report organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs) with easily programmable optical absorption. By employing different common donor and acceptor molecules to form CTC nanoparticles (CT NPs), absorption peaks of CT NPs can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region. Notably, CT NPs formed with perylene and TCNQ have a considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040&#8197;nm and achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm excitation. These nanoparticles were used for antibacterial application with effective activity towards both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This work opens a new avenue into the development of efficient PTAs.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversible Surfactant&#8208;Induced Transformation Between Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions and Pickering Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11793-11798, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emulsion was stabilized by silica particles in combination with a charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, which can be converted between anionic, zwitterionic and cationic forms by pH trigger. Not only can rapid demulsification be achieved, but the emulsion can also be reversibly switched between an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion and a Pickering emulsion. This strategy endows the emulsion with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.







Abstract
A novel charge&#8208;reversible surfactant, (CH3)2N&#8208;(CH2)10COONa, was designed and synthesized, which together with silica nanoparticles can stabilize a smart n&#8208;octane&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion responsive to pH. At high pH (9.3) the surfactant is anionic carboxylate, which together with the negatively charged silica nanoparticles co&#8208;stabilize flowable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions, whereas at low pH (4.1) it is turned to cationic form by forming amine salt which can hydrophobize in situ the negatively charged silica nanoparticles to stabilize viscous oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) Pickering emulsions. At neutral pH (7.5), however, this surfactant is converted to zwitterionic form, which only weakly hydrophobises the silica particles to stabilize O/W Pickering emulsions of large droplet size. Moreover, demulsification can be achieved rapidly triggered by pH. With this strategy particles can be controlled either dispersed in water or adsorbed at the oil&#8208;water interface endowing emulsions with the capacity for intelligent and precise control of stability as well as viscosity and droplet size.

         <title>Recombinant Spider Silk Gels Derived from Aqueous&#8211;Organic Solvents as Depots for Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11847-11851, May 17, 2021. </description>

Apart from the fact that spider silk hydrogels can serve as drug depots for water&#8208;soluble drugs, recombinant spider silk proteins can also assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich structures in aqueous&#8211;organic binary systems. The organic&#8208;phase content of these non&#8208;toxic, biocompatible gels allows the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs for various applications.







Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in various biomedical applications, as they cannot only serve as materials for biofabrication but also as depots for the administration of drugs. However, the possibilities of formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in hydrogels are rather limited. Herein, we assembled recombinant spider silk gels using a new processing route with aqueous&#8211;organic co&#8208;solvents, and the properties of these gels could be controlled by the choice of the co&#8208;solvent. The presence of the organic co&#8208;solvent further enabled the incorporation of hydrophobic drugs as exemplarily shown for 6&#8208;mercaptopurine. The developed gels showed shear&#8208;thinning behaviour and could be easily injected to serve, for example, as drug depots, and they could even be 3D printed to serve as scaffolds for biofabrication. With this new processing route, the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in spider silk&#8208;based depots is possible, circumventing common pharmaceutical solubility issues.

An amine&#8211;borane system has been discovered to deliver a reversible dehydrogenation/regeneration at room temperature. It provides a new way for hydrogen storage under mild conditions. 







Abstract
Amine&#8211;borane complexes have been extensively studied as hydrogen storage materials. Herein, we report a new amine&#8211;borane system featuring a reversible dehydrogenation and regeneration at room temperature. In addition to high purity H2, the reaction between ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB) and ethylenediamine (ED) leads to unique boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen 5&#8208;membered rings in the dehydrogenation product where one boron is tricoordinated by three nitrogen atoms. Owing to the unique cyclic structure, the dehydrogenation product can be efficiently converted back to EDAB by NaBH4 and H2O at room temperature. This finding could lead to the discovery of new amine boranes with potential usage as hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>A Cavity&#8208;Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Entraps Gases Selectively in Solution and the Amorphous Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11789-11792, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn4L4 coordination cage enabled entrapment of gases in both solution and the amorphous solid state at atmospheric pressure. The lipophilic cavity of the cage was designed through a cavity&#8208;filling strategy, which could bind small hydrocarbon gases. A contrasting selectivity of gas capture was observed in solution and the solid state, showing the potential of the cage to be engineered as porous liquids or solid adsorbents for gas separation.







Abstract
Here we report the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of a truxene&#8208;faced Zn4L4 tetrahedron, which is capable of binding the smallest hydrocarbons in solution. By deliberately incorporating inward&#8208;facing ethyl groups on the truxene faces, the resulting partially&#8208;filled cage cavity was tailored to encapsulate methane, ethane, and ethene via van der Waals interactions at atmospheric pressure in acetonitrile, and also in the amorphous solid state. Interestingly, gas capture showed divergent selectivities in solution and the amorphous solid state. The selective binding may prove useful in designing new processes for the purification of methane and ethane as feedstocks for chemical synthesis.

         <title>DNA Origami&#8208;Based Nanoprinting for the Assembly of Plasmonic Nanostructures with Single&#8208;Molecule Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering</title>

DNA origami&#8208;based nanoprinting can transfer DNA strands with predefined sequences and positions to gold nanocube surfaces to create the stereo&#8208;controlled metallic nanostructures with controlled geometry and composition. By anchoring the single dye molecule in hot spot regions, the dramatic enhanced electromagnetic field aroused stronger SERS signal amplification.







Abstract
Metallic nanocube ensembles exhibit tunable localized surface plasmon resonance to induce the light manipulation at the subwavelength scale. Nevertheless, precisely control anisotropic metallic nanocube ensembles with relative spatial directionality remains a challenge. Here, we report a DNA origami based nanoprinting (DOBNP) strategy to transfer the essential DNA strands with predefined sequences and positions to the surface of the gold nanocubes (AuNCs). These DNA strands ensured the specific linkages between AuNCs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that generating the stereo&#8208;controlled AuNC&#8208;AuNP nanostructures (AANs) with controlled geometry and composition. By anchoring the single dye molecule in hot spot regions, the dramatic enhanced electromagnetic field aroused stronger surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal amplification. Our approach opens the opportunity for the fabrication of stereo&#8208;controlled metal nanostructures for designing highly sensitive photonic devices.

         <title>Massive Pressure Amplification by Stimulated Contraction of Mesoporous Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11735-11739, May 17, 2021. </description>

Negative Gas Adsorption is a unique counterintuitive phenomenon of responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks hitherto only observed below atmospheric pressure. Carbon dioxide stimulates contraction at high absolute pressure inducing massive pressure amplification exceeding 500&#8197;kPa.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate mesoporous frameworks interacting with carbon dioxide leading to stimulated structural contractions and massive out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pressure amplification well beyond ambient pressure. Carbon dioxide, a non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable working medium, is promising for the development of pressure&#8208;amplifying frameworks for pneumatic technologies and safety systems. The strong interaction of the fluid with the framework even contracts DUT&#8208;46, a framework hitherto considered as non&#8208;flexible. Synchrotron&#8208;based in&#8197;situ PXRD/adsorption experiments reveal the characteristic contraction pressure for DUT&#8208;49 pressure amplification in the range of 350&#8211;680&#8197;kPa. The stimulated framework contraction expels 1.1 to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO2 leading to autonomous pressure amplification in a pneumatic demonstrator system up to 428&#8197;kPa. According to system level estimations even higher theoretical pressure amplification may be achieved between 535 and 1011&#8197;kPa.

         <title>ITQ&#8208;69: A Germanium&#8208;Containing Zeolite and its Synthesis, Structure Determination, and Adsorption Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11745-11750, May 17, 2021. </description>

ITQ&#8208;69 has been synthesized, characterized, and its application as selective adsorbent for light olefins/paraffins has been tested.







Abstract
In this work, a new zeolite named as ITQ&#8208;69, has been synthesized, characterized and its application as selective adsorbent for industrially relevant light olefins/paraffins separations has been assessed. This material has been obtained as pure germania as well as silica&#8208;germania zeolites with different Si/Ge ratios using a diquaternary ammonium cation as organic structure directing agent. Its structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray diffraction showing a triclinic unit cell forming a tridirectional small pore channel system (8&#215;8&#215;8R). Also, it has been found that Si preferentially occupies some special T sites of the structure as deduced from Rietveld analysis of the powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. In addition, the new zeolite ITQ&#8208;69 has been found to be stable upon calcination and thus, its adsorption properties were evaluated, showing a promising kinetic selectivity for light olefin separations in the C3 fraction.

A convenient, rapid and robust meniscus&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly (MASA) strategy, which combines a deliberately designed upper plate with a moving substrate, prints microscopically conjugated polymer (PFOs) patterns of different shapes within which the &#946;&#8208;phase PFOs self&#8208;assemble at the nanometer scale.







Abstract
Rapid and deliberate patterning of nanomaterials over a large area is desirable for device manufacturing. We report a method for meniscus&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly (MASA)&#8208;enabled rapid positioning of hierarchically assembled dots and stripes composed of luminescent conjugated polymer over two length scales. Periodically arranged conjugated poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene) (PFO) polymers, yield dots, punch&#8208;holes and stripes at microscopic scale via MASA. Concurrent self&#8208;assembly of PFOs into two&#8208;dimensional lenticular crystals within each dot, punch&#8208;hole and stripe is realized at nanoscopic scale. Hierarchical assembly is achieved by constraining the evaporation of the PFOs solution in two approximately parallel plates via a MASA process. The three&#8208;phase contact line (TCL) of the liquid meniscus of the PFOs was printed using the upper plate, yielding an array of curved stripes. Rapid creation of hierarchical assemblies via MASA opens up possibilities for large&#8208;scale organization of a wide range of soft matters and nanomaterials.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Biomimetic Oxidation of Amines using a Hybrid Hydroquinone/Cobalt Catalyst as Electron Transfer Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11819-11823, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines has been developed. The principle is based on biological oxidation in the respiratory chain in living organisms. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen occurs through coupled redox reactions, mediated by a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base as hybrid catalyst. This hybrid catalyst was found to significantly shield the iron catalyst from deactivation.







Abstract
Herein we report the first FeII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines. This oxidation reaction involves several electron transfer steps and is inspired by biological oxidation in the respiratory chain. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen is aided by two coupled catalytic redox systems, which lower the energy barrier and improve the selectivity of the oxidation reaction. An iron hydrogen transfer complex was utilized as the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation catalyst along with a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base complex as a hybrid electron transfer mediator. Various primary and secondary amines were oxidized in air to their corresponding aldimines or ketimines in good to excellent yield.

         <title>Enhanced Ultrasound Contrast of Renal&#8208;Clearable Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 21, Page 11713-11717, May 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and aggregation properties are designed to achieve significant reabsorption and in situ aggregation of AuNPs in tubular cells of injured kidneys to show enhanced ultrasound signals toward synergetic fluorescence and ultrasound diagnosis of early kidney injury with precise anatomical information.







Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable nanoparticles are typically fast eliminated through the free glomerular filtration, which show weak interaction with the renal compartments and negligible ultrasound signals, raising challenges in direct imaging of kidney diseases. Here, we report the ultrasmall renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with both pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and aggregation properties, and discover that enhanced ultrasound contrast could be facilely acquired through the increased tubular reabsorption and in situ aggregation of AuNPs in renal tubule cells in injured kidneys. The tuning elimination pathway of the renal&#8208;clearable luminescent AuNPs is further demonstrated to provide a synergistical fluorescence and ultrasound imaging strategy for diagnosing early kidney injury with precise anatomical information.

         <title>Direct Mapping of Phospholipid Ferroptotic Death Signals in Cells and Tissues by Gas Cluster Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS)</title>

Gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70&#8197;keV (H2O)n+ (n&gt;28&#8201;000) cluster ion beam mapped peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) with 1.2&#8197;&#956;m spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level. This visualized low abundance peroxidized lipids in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury.







Abstract
Peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) species have been identified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) as predictive biomarkers of ferroptosis, a new program of regulated cell death. However, the presence and subcellular distribution of PEox in specific cell types and tissues have not been directly detected by imaging protocols. By applying gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70&#8197;keV (H2O)n+ (n&gt;28&#8201;000) cluster ion beam, we were able to map PEox with 1.2&#8197;&#956;m spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury. Application of this protocol affords visualization of physiologically relevant levels of very low abundance (20&#8197;pmol&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1 lipid) peroxidized lipids in subcellular compartments and their accumulation in disease conditions.

Co&#8208;based trimetallic spinel oxide nanoboxes are synthesized through an elaborate strategy involving chemical etching, cation exchange and thermal oxidation processes. The unique structural and compositional advantages endow the trimetallic NiCo2&#8722;xFexO4 nanoboxes with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The development of efficient and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for improving the efficiency of several electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Here, we report an elaborate design and synthesis of porous Co&#8208;based trimetallic spinel oxide nanoboxes (NiCo2&#8722;xFexO4 NBs) by a novel metal&#8208;organic framework engaged strategy, which involves chemical etching, cation exchange, and subsequent thermal oxidation processes. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, the optimized trimetallic NiCo2&#8722;xFexO4 NBs (x is about 0.117) deliver superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 274&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline electrolyte, which is much better than that of Co&#8208;based bi/monometallic spinel oxides and even commercial RuO2.

         <title>Novel Lamellar Tetrapotassium Pyromellitic Organic for Robust High&#8208;Capacity Potassium Storage</title>

The lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K4PM) for a K&#8208;organic battery delivers a high capacity and excellent cycling robustness due to its four K+ ion storage sites and large layer distance with reversible rearrangement of conjugated carboxyls into enolates.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active organics are investigation hotspots for metal ion storage due to their structural diversity and redox reversibility. However, they are plagued by limited storage capacity, sluggish ion diffusion kinetics, and weak structural stability, especially for K+ ion storage. Herein, we firstly reported the lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K4PM) with four active sites and large interlayer distance for K+ ion storage based on a design strategy, where organics are constructed with the small molecular mass, multiple active sites, fast ion diffusion channels, and rigid conjugated &#960; bonds. The K4PM electrode delivers a high capacity up to 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, among the best reported organics for K+ ion storage. Especially, it achieves an excellent rate capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability with a capacity retention of &#8776;83&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Incorporating in situ and ex&#8208;situ techniques, the K+ ion storage mechanism is revealed, where conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates to stably store K+ ions. This work sheds light on the rational design and optimization of organic electrodes for efficient metal ion storage.

         <title>The Desensitized Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 Photointermediate Contains 13&#8208;cis,15&#8208;syn Retinal Schiff Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) is a light&#8208;gated cation channel and was used to lay the foundations of optogenetics. Its dark state X&#8208;ray structure has been determined in 2017 for the wild&#8208;type, which is the prototype for all other ChR variants. However, the mechanistic understanding of the channel function is still incomplete in terms of structural changes after photon absorption by the retinal chromophore and in the framework of functional models. Hence, detailed information needs to be collected on the dark state as well as on the different photointermediates. For ChR&#8208;2 detailed knowledge on the chromophore configuration in the different states is still missing and a consensus has not been achieved. Using DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state MAS NMR spectroscopy on proteoliposome samples, we unambiguously determine the chromophore configuration in the desensitized state, and we show that this state occurs towards the end of the photocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Role of Bicarbonate in Calcium Carbonate Formation at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic pathways relevant to mineralization are not well&#8208;understood fundamentally, let alone in the context of their biological and geological environments. Through quantitative analysis of ion association at near&#8208;neutral pH, we identify the involvement of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions in CaCO  3  nucleation. Incorporation of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions into the structure of amorphous intermediates is corroborated by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We identify the roles of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions as being through (i) competition for ion association during the formation of ion pairs and ion clusters prior to nucleation and (ii) incorporation as a significant structural component of amorphous mineral particles. The role of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions as active soluble species and structural constituents in CaCO  3  formation are of fundamental importance and provide a basis for a better understanding of physiological and geological mineralization.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable dynamic shapes with a swarm of light&#8208;powered colloidal motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report robust control over the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and reconfiguration of light&#8208;activated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) colloidal motor swarms with features not possible in equilibrium systems. A photochemical reaction produces chemical gradients across the MoS2 colloidal motors to drive them to move. Under illumination of a gradient light, these colloidal motors display a positive phototactic motion. Mesoscale simulations prove that the self&#8208;diffusiophoresis induced by the locally consumed oxygen gradient across MoS2 colloidal motors dominates the phototactic process. By programming the structured illumination, the collective migration and well&#8208;defined shapes of colloidal motor swarms can be externally regulated. The successful realization of programmable swarm transformation of colloidal motors like the emergent behaviors of living systems in nature provides a direct proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for active soft materials and systems, with adaptive and interactive functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Exchange Induced in situ Conductivity in Nickel Based Oxyhydroxides: An Effective Descriptor for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in sustainable energy conversion from water to hydrogen fuel. The most effective non&#8208;noble metal catalyst for OER is currently Fe&#8208;doped NiOOH (Ni  1&#8208;x  Fe  x  OOH), but its overpotential (theoretically calculated  &#951;  = 0.4) is too large for practical applications. Motivated by our  in silico  predictions that Ir dopant would lead to a very low overpotential to improve OER activity of Ni&#8208;based hydroxides, we report here an experimental confirmation on the altered OER activities for a series of metals (Mo, W, Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir) doped into &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. Most interestingly, we observed that the  in situ  (intermediate) electrical conductivity for metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH correlates well with the trend in enhanced OER activities. This correlation allows experimental screening of new candidates with fast measurements of intermediate conductivity, while also providing additional information about the catalytic mechanism. To understand the basis of this correlation, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explain the  in situ  conductivity of the key intermediate states of metal doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during OER. The simultaneous increase of OER activity with  in situ  conductivity was rationalized by their intrinsic connections to the radical character promotion in the metal&#8208;oxo bond. This electrical transport characteristic, which was later linked to the double exchange (DE) interactions between adjacent metal ions with various  d  orbital occupancies, serves as an effective indicator for the key metal&#8208;oxo radical character, providing a facile and effective descriptor for the theoretical and experimental guidance in design and screening of efficient OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituted Dihydropyridine Synthesis by Dearomatization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free dearomatization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful method to yield partially saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. Yet, the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we present a very mild and selective reduction of N&#8208;heteroarenes by amine borane to synthesize a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines.







Abstract
Dearomatization is an effective method to transform readily available N&#8208;heterocycles into partially saturated motifs. Manipulation of dihydro&#8208;derivatives holds great potential and provides access to a variety of semi&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. However, current strategies are limited in scope and the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we report the synthesis of a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines by very mild and selective reduction with amine borane for the first time.

         <title>Highly Coordinated Heteronuclear Calcium&#8211;Iron Carbonyl Cation Complexes [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) with d&#8722;d Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [CaFe(CO)10]+ cation is characterized to be a coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 moiety through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. The complex is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8722;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond that is enhanced by the attraction between Ca and the bridging CO ligands.







Abstract
Heteronuclear calcium&#8211;iron carbonyl cation complexes in the form of [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) are produced in the gas phase. Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations confirm that the n=10 complex is the coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 fragment through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8594;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond in the [(CO)6Ca&#8211;Fe(CO)4]+ structure, which enriches the pool of experimentally observed complexes of calcium that mimic transition metal compounds. The molecule is the first example of a heteronuclear carbonyl complex featuring a d&#8722;d bond between calcium and a transition metal.

         <title>Interweaving Visible&#8208;Light and Iron Catalysis for Nitrene Formation and Transformation with Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions with dioxazolones are used for intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;N, N=S and N=P bond formation. The key acyl nitrene iron intermediate is formed by conversion of the ground sextet state of dioxazolone&#8208;bounding iron species to quartet spin state under visible&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Herein, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven iron&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions with dioxazolones for intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;N, N=S, and N=P bond formation are described. These reactions occur with exogenous&#8208;ligand&#8208;free process and feature satisfactory to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%), an ample substrate scope (109 examples) under mild reaction conditions. In contrast to intramolecular C&#8722;H amidations strategies, an intermolecular regioselective C&#8722;H amidation via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced nitrene transfer reactions is devised. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway. Computational studies show that the decarboxylation of dioxazolone depends on the conversion of ground sextet state dioxazolone&#8208;bounding iron species to quartet spin state via visible&#8208;light irradiation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Tyrosine Nitration of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet effective dinitroimidazole reagent for light&#8208;controlled nitration of tyrosine residues in peptides and proteins was developed.







Abstract
Tyrosine nitration of proteins is one of the most important oxidative post&#8208;translational modifications in vivo. A major obstacle for its biochemical and physiological studies is the lack of efficient and chemoselective protein tyrosine nitration reagents. Herein, we report a generalizable strategy for light&#8208;controlled protein tyrosine nitration by employing biocompatible dinitroimidazole reagents. Upon 390&#8197;nm irradiation, dinitroimidazoles efficiently convert tyrosine residues into 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine residues in peptides and proteins with fast kinetics and high chemoselectivity under neutral aqueous buffer conditions. The incorporation of 3&#8208;nitrotyrosine residues enhances the thermostability of lasso peptide natural products and endows murine tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; with strong immunogenicity to break self&#8208;tolerance. The light&#8208;controlled time resolution of this method allows the investigation of the impact of tyrosine nitration on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of &#945;&#8208;synuclein.

         <title>Separation&#8208;Controlled Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox reactions are quite difficult to control because their reaction equilibrium constants strongly depart from unity (particularly if at least one of the reactants is a potent oxidizing or reducing agent). Based on calculations, smooth control of charge transfer depending solely on the separation between oxidizer and reductant is proposed. AgF2, a powerful oxidizer, may be electron&#8208;doped to a controlled extent using this approach.







Abstract
In the era of molecular devices and nanotechnology, precise control over electron&#8208;transfer processes is strongly desired. However, redox reactions are usually characterized by reaction equilibrium constants strongly departing from unity. This leads to strong favoring of either reactants or products and does not permit subtle control of transferred charge (doping). Here we propose, based on theoretical studies for periodic systems, how charge transfer between reactants could be finely manipulated in the epitaxially grown system composed of extremely strong oxidizer, reducing agent, and an inert separator&#8212;the key factor of control.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;Vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regenerative surface vacancies could be repeatedly created by external conditions like UV light irradiation. These regenerative surface vacancies can significantly improve the cycling stability and eventually realize both high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640&#8197;h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of 16&#960; Antiaromatic 2,7&#8208;Dihydrodiazapyrenes: Antiaromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons with Embedded Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8242;&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;dihydrodiazapyrenes were synthesized and characterized. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with a pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and calculations confirmed the presence of a distinct paratropic ring current. N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;dihydrodiazapyrenes exhibit an antiaromatic character derived from their peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.







Abstract
We describe the two&#8208;electron reduction of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diazapyrenium dications (MDAP2+), which afforded the corresponding reduced form (MDAP0) as a highly electron&#8208;rich 16&#960; antiaromatic system. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of MDAP0 revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with high bond&#8208;length alternation. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum of MDAP0 exhibited a diagnostic proton signal (4.6&#8197;ppm) that is distinctly upfield shifted compared to that of aromatic diazapyrene (8.3&#8197;ppm). Theoretical calculations supported the existence of a paratropic ring current. These results indicate that MDAP0 exhibits antiaromatic character derived from its peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.

         <title>Rational Design of Multicolor&#8208;Emitting Chiral Carbonized Polymer Dots for Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) is reported for the first time. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs is between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Furthermore, these Ch&#8208;CPDs were combined with chiral gels through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby yielding their multicolor and white circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) are attracting great interest because of their extraordinary photonic properties, but modulating their band&#8208;gap emission, especially at long wavelength, and maintaining their chiral structure to achieve multicolor, high&#8208;emission Ch&#8208;CPDs remains challenging. Reported here for the first time is the synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting Ch&#8208;CPDs using the common precursors L&#8208;/D&#8208;tryptophan and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, and a solvothermal approach at one temperature. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs was between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provided multicolor&#8208;emitting Ch&#8208;CPDs showing novel circularly polarized luminescence, with the highest dissymmetric factor (glum) of 1&#215;10&#8722;2. Importantly, circularly polarized white&#8208;emitting CPDs were fabricated for the first time by tuning the mixing ratio of the three colored Ch&#8208;CPDs in a gel. This strategy affords exciting opportunities for designing functional chiroptical materials.

         <title>carba Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate: Robust Cofactor for Redox Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust cofactor analog (carba&#8208;NADP+) is described here with a 33&#8208;times longer half&#8208;life time when the cofactor is heated up to 50&#8201;&#176;C. Decomposition experiments on the reduced form at low pH values showed a drastic increase in stability. The cofactor is found to make a significant contribution to the field of redox&#8208;biocatalysis under harsh conditions retaining most of its enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Here we report a new robust nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate cofactor analog (carba&#8208;NADP+) and its acceptance by many enzymes in the class of oxidoreductases. Replacing one ribose oxygen with a methylene group of the natural NADP+ was found to enhance stability dramatically. Decomposition experiments at moderate and high temperatures with the cofactors showed a drastic increase in half&#8208;life time at elevated temperatures since it significantly disfavors hydrolysis of the pyridinium&#8208;N&#8722;glycoside bond. Overall, more than 27 different oxidoreductases were successfully tested, and a thorough analytical characterization and comparison is given. The cofactor carba&#8208;NADP+ opens up the field of redox&#8208;biocatalysis under harsh conditions.

         <title>Antiprotozoal Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships of Synthetic Leucinostatin Derivatives and Elucidation of their Mode of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8211;activity relationship of the natural product Leucinostatin A was performed to result in two highly potent compounds against the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei with decreased toxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Those compounds did not form any resistance by long&#8208;time sublethal exposure and their mode of action lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane.







Abstract
Leucinostatin A is one of the most potent antiprotozoal compounds ever described, but little was known on structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR). We used Trypanosoma brucei as a protozoal model organism to test synthetically modified derivatives, resulting in simplified but equally active compounds 2 (ZHAWOC6025) and 4 (ZHAWOC6027), which were subsequently modified in all regions of the molecule to gain an in&#8208;depth SAR understanding. The antiprotozoal SAR matched SAR in phospholipid liposomes, where membrane integrity, leaking, and dynamics were studied. The mode of action is discussed based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of derivatives in efficacy, ultrastructural studies in T. brucei, and artificial membrane models, mimicking membrane stability and membrane potential. The main site of antiprotozoal action of natural and synthetic leucinostatins lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis, electron microscopy and mitochondrial staining. Long&#8208;time sublethal exposure of T. brucei (200 passages) and siRNA screening of 12&#8242;000 mutants showed no signs of resistance development to the synthetic derivatives.

Those compounds did not form any resistance by long&#8208;time sublethal exposure and their mode of action lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucinostatin A is one of the most potent antiprotozoal compounds ever described, but little was known on structure&#8211;activity relationships (SAR). We used &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; as a protozoal model organism to test synthetically modified derivatives, resulting in simplified but equally active compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (ZHAWOC6025) and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; (ZHAWOC6027), which were subsequently modified in all regions of the molecule to gain an in&#8208;depth SAR understanding. The antiprotozoal SAR matched SAR in phospholipid liposomes, where membrane integrity, leaking, and dynamics were studied. The mode of action is discussed based on a structure&#8211;activity analysis of derivatives in efficacy, ultrastructural studies in &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt;, and artificial membrane models, mimicking membrane stability and membrane potential. The main site of antiprotozoal action of natural and synthetic leucinostatins lies in the destabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis, electron microscopy and mitochondrial staining. Long&#8208;time sublethal exposure of &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt; (200 passages) and siRNA screening of 12&#8242;000 mutants showed no signs of resistance development to the synthetic derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ammonia Formation Catalyzed by a Dinitrogen&#8208;Bridged Dirhenium Complex Bearing PNP&#8208;Pincer Ligands under Mild Reaction Conditions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation using a rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions is described in this paper. The dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex worked as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia and silylamine, where up to 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia and 11.7&#8197;equiv of silylamine were produced based on the Re atom of the catalyst.







Abstract
A series of rhenium complexes bearing a pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand are synthesized from rhenium phosphine complexes as precursors. A dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex bearing the PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands catalytically converts dinitrogen into ammonia during the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and [HPCy3]BArF4 (Cy=cyclohexyl, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) as a proton source at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to afford 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. The rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex also catalyzes silylation of dinitrogen in the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and Me3SiCl as a silylating reagent under ambient reaction conditions to afford 11.7&#8197;equiv of tris(trimethylsilyl)amine based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. These results demonstrate the first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions using rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complexes as catalysts.

The strategy can also be applied for the selective modification of biopolymers, such as DNA or peptides.

         <title>Heterotrimetallic Carbon Dioxide Copolymerization and Switchable Catalysts: Sodium is the Key to High Activity and Unusual Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dizinc&#8208;sodium catalyst has been synthesized which allows precise control of CO2 incorporation within poly(carbonates), &#8208;esters, and &#8208;ethers. The catalyst selectively switches between three distinct catalytic cycles; kinetics and structure&#8211;activity studies inform the mechanisms of switchable polymerization catalysis.







Abstract
A challenge in polymer synthesis using CO2 is to precisely control CO2 placement in the backbone and chain end groups. Here, a new catalyst class delivers unusual selectivity and is self&#8208;switched between different polymerization cycles to construct specific sequences and desirable chain&#8208;end chemistries. The best catalyst is a trinuclear dizinc(II)sodium(I) complex and it functions without additives or co&#8208;catalysts. It shows excellent rates across different ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerization catalytic cycles and allows precise control of CO2 incorporation within polyesters and polyethers, thereby allowing access to new polymer chemistries without requiring esoteric monomers, multi&#8208;reactor processes or complex post&#8208;polymerization procedures. The structures, kinetics and mechanisms of the catalysts are investigated, providing evidence for intermediate speciation and uncovering the factors governing structure and composition and thereby guiding future catalyst design.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The systemic use of pharmaceutical drugs for cancer patients is a compromise between desirable therapy and side effects because of the intrinsic shortage of organ&#8208;specific pharmaceutical drug. Design and construction of pharmaceutical drug to achieve the organ&#8208;specific delivery is thus desperately desirable. We herein regulate perylene skeleton to effect organ&#8208;specificity and present an example of lung&#8208;specific distribution on the basis of bay&#8208;twisted PDIC&#8208;NC. We further demonstrate that PDIC&#8208;NC can target into mitochondria to act as cellular respiration inhibitor, inducing insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate, promoting endogenous H  2  O  2  and &#183;OH burst, elevating calcium overload, efficiently triggering the synergistic apoptosis, autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress of lung cancer cells. The antitumor performance of PDIC&#8208;NC is verified on  in vivo  xenografted, metastasis and orthotopic lung cancer, presenting overwhelming evidences for potentially clinical application. This study contributes a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of twisted perylene to well attain lung&#8208;specific distribution and meanwhile achieve intensive lung cancer chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Pinning Effect Enhanced Structural Stability toward a Zero&#8208;Strain Layered Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pinning effect and controllable pinning point were proposed to enhance the structural stability of sodium storage layered cathode. STEM revealed the pinned transition metal in sodium layer; in situ XRD indicated the cathode material underwent an ultra&#8208;low volume variation of 0.6&#8201;% in the whole charge&#8211;discharge process.







Abstract
Layered oxides as the cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries are receiving extensive attention due to their high capacity and flexible composition. However, the layered cathode tends to be thermodynamically and electrochemically unstable during (de)sodiation. Herein, we propose the pinning effect and controllable pinning point in sodium storage layered cathodes to enhance the structural stability and achieve optimal electrochemical performance. 0&#8201;%, 2.5&#8201;% and 7.3&#8201;% transition&#8208;metal occupancies in Na&#8208;site as pinning points are obtained in Na0.67Mn0.5Co0.5&#8722;xFexO2. 2.5&#8201;% Na&#8208;site pinned by Fe3+ is beneficial to restrain the potential slab sliding and enhance the structural stability, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low volume variation of 0.6&#8201;% and maintaining the smooth two&#8208;dimensional channel for Na&#8208;ion transfer. The Na0.67Mn0.5Co0.4Fe0.1O2 cathode with the optimal Fe3+ pinning delivers outstanding cycle performance of over 1000&#8197;cycles and superior rate capability up to 10&#8197;C.

         <title>Synthesis of Ionic Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through Quaternization&#8208;Activated Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic, vinylene&#8208;linked, two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized by reticulating 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridinium salts with multi&#8208;topic aromatic aldehyde derivatives through a quaternization&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel condensation. The quaternization of pyridine activates the attached methyl groups and charges the framework simultaneously.







Abstract
We developed a simple approach to synthesizing ionic vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through a quaternization&#8208;promoted Knoevenagel condensation at three aromatic methyl carbon atoms of N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridinium halide with multitopic aromatic aldehyde derivatives. The resultant COFs exhibited a honeycomb&#8208;like structure with high crystallinity and surface areas as large as 1343&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. The regular shape&#8208;persistent nanochannels and the positively charged polymeric frameworks allowed the COFs to be uniformly composited with linear polyethylene oxide and lithium salt, displaying ionic conductivity as high as 2.72&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;Based Nanoparticles Combine X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Nitrosative Stress with Autophagy Management for Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor treatments are predominant in clinical applications, ROS&#8208;induced protective autophagy promotes cell survival, especially in hypoxic tumors. Herein, X&#8208;ray triggered nitrite (NO2&#8208;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting autophagy and inducing nitrosative stress based on an electrophilic zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP). After internalization of pH&#8208;responsive ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles, electrophilic ligands and Zn2+ are delivered into cancer cells. Electrophilic ligands not only can consume GSH under hypoxia but can also capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to generate NO2&#8208;, which inhibits autophagy and further elevates lethal nitrosative stress levels. In addition, dissociated Zn2+ specifically limits the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through ion interference. In vitro and in vivo results indicate that ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles under X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively promote the apoptosis of hypoxic prostate cancer cells. Overall, this nitrosative stress&#8208;mediated tumor therapy strategy provides a novel approach targeting hypoxic tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>A synthetic galectin mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Galectins are a galactoside specific subclass of carbohydrate binding proteins (lectins) involved in various cellular activities, certain cancers, infections, inflammations and many other biological processes. The molecular basis for the selectivity of galectins is well&#8208;documented and revolves around appropriate interaction complementarity: an aromatic residue for C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and polar residues for (charge assisted) hydrogen bonds with the axial hydroxyl group of a galactoside. Despite this knowledge, no synthetic mimics are currently available. Here, we report on the design and synthesis of the first galectin mimic (  6  ), and show that it has a higher than 65&#8208;fold preference for  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galactoside (  8  ) over  n  &#8208;octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucoside (  7  ) in CD  2  Cl  2  containing 5% DMSO&#8208;  d  6  (with  K  a  &#8805; 4500 M  &#8208;1  for  6  :  8  ). Molecular modelling informed by nOe studies reveal a high degree of interaction complementarity between  6  and galactoside  8  , which is very similar to the interaction complementarity found in natural galectins.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Noncanonical Features of the Nonlinear Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Assembly Line for WS9326A Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic inactivation of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains and translocation of the thioesterase (TE) domain revealed several unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of the cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A in Streptomyces  sp. SNM55. First, two sets of type &#921;&#921; TE (TE&#921;&#921;)&#8208;like enzymes mediate the shuttling of activated amino acids between two sets of stand&#8208;alone adenylation (A)&#8208;thiolation (T) didomain modules and an &#8216;A&#8208;less&#8217; condensation (C)&#8208;T module with distinctive specificities and flexibilities. This was confirmed by the elucidation of the affinities of the A&#8208;T didomains for the TE&#921;&#921;s and its structure. Second, the C&#8208;T didomain module operates iteratively and independently from other modules in the same protein to catalyze two chain elongation cycles. Third, this biosynthetic pathway includes the first example of module skipping, where the interpolated C and T domains are required for chain transfer. Understanding such untapped nonlinear biosynthetic strategies will provide potentially valuable tools for engineered biosynthesis of these complex natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering Hydrogenation Pathways in Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation by Tuning Local Electronic Structure of Oxygen Vacancy with Dopant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To avoid the energy&#8208;consuming step of direct N [[EQUATION]] N bond cleavage, photocatalytic N2 fixation undergoing the associative pathways has been developed for mild&#8208;condition operation. However, it is a fundamental yet challenging task to gain comprehensive understanding on how the associative pathways (i.e., alternating vs. distal) are influenced and altered by the fine structure of catalysts, which eventually holds the key to significantly promote the practical implementation. Herein, we introduce Fe dopants into TiO2 nanofibers to stabilize oxygen vacancies and simultaneously tune their local electronic structure. The combination of in&#8208;situ characterizations with first&#8208;principles simulations reveals that the modulation of local electronic structure by Fe dopants turns the hydrogenation of N2 from associative alternating pathway to associative distal pathway. This work provides fresh hints for rationally controlling the reaction pathways toward efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Thermocatalytic Activities via Up&#8208;shift of the d&#8208;Band Center of Exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe Ternary Alloy Nanoparticles for Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a feasible solution to cope with the reduction of greenhouse gas under the Paris Convention&#8217;s obligations, given that it adds value by converting trivial gases of CO2 and CH4 simultaneously into useful syngas. However, conventional Ni catalyst undergoes deactivation due to carbon coking and particle agglomeration. Here we demonstrate for the first time a highly efficient and durable DRM catalyst of exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe ternary alloy nanoparticles on the layered perovskite PrBaMn1.7Co0.1Ni0.2O5+d&#160;produced by topotactic exsolution. This readily allows the generation of a larger number of exsolved nanoparticles, enhancing catalytic activity above those of Ni monometallic and Co&#8208;Ni bimetallic particles. The enhancement is achieved by the optimal up&#8208;shift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe than those of Co&#8208;Ni and Ni meaning easier charge donation to the adsorbate. Furthermore, the exsolved catalyst shows exceptional stability with the continuous DRM operation for about 350 hours.</dc:description>

Here we demonstrate for the first time a highly efficient and durable DRM catalyst of exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe ternary alloy nanoparticles on the layered perovskite PrBaMn1.7Co0.1Ni0.2O5+d&#160;produced by topotactic exsolution. This readily allows the generation of a larger number of exsolved nanoparticles, enhancing catalytic activity above those of Ni monometallic and Co&#8208;Ni bimetallic particles. The enhancement is achieved by the optimal up&#8208;shift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe than those of Co&#8208;Ni and Ni meaning easier charge donation to the adsorbate. Furthermore, the exsolved catalyst shows exceptional stability with the continuous DRM operation for about 350 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A novel family of nonribosomal peptides modulate collective behavior in Pseudovibrio bacteria isolated from marine sponges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although swarming motility and biofilms are opposed collective behaviors, both contribute to bacterial survival and host colonization. Pseudovibrio bacteria have attracted attention because they are part of the microbiome of healthy marine sponges. Two&#8208;thirds of Pseudovibrio genomes contain a member of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase gene cluster family, which is also found sporadically in Pseudomonas pathogens of insects and plants. After developing reverse genetics for Pseudovibrio, we isolated heptapeptides with an ureido linkage and related nonadepsipeptides we termed pseudovibriamides A and B, respectively. A combination of genetics and imaging mass spectrometry experiments showed heptapetides were excreted, promoting motility and reducing biofilm formation. In contrast to lipopeptides widely known to affect motility/biofilms, pseudovibriamides are not surfactants. Our results expand current knowledge on metabolites mediating bacterial collective behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapochromism and Magnetochemical Switching of a Nickel(II) Paddlewheel Complex by Reversible NH3 Uptake and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni2 paddlewheel complex can reversibly bind ammonia. This triggers spin&#8208;state switching from dia&#8208; to paramagnetic and a change of color. Coordination of NH3 is fully reversible in solution, in solid state as well as encapsulated in a polyurethane foil.







Abstract
Reaction of [NiCl2(PnH)4] (1) (PnH=6&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;thione) with NiCl2 affords the binuclear paddlewheel (PW) complex [Ni2(Pn)4] (2). Diamagnetic complex 2 is the first example of a PW complex capable of reversibly binding and releasing NH3. The NH3 ligand in [Ni2(Pn)4(NH3)] (2&#8901;NH3) enforces major spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility changes, thus displaying vapochromic properties (&#955;max(2)=532&#8197;nm, &#955;max(2&#8901;NH3)=518&#8197;nm) and magnetochemical switching (2: S=0; 2&#8901;NH3: S=1). Upon repeated adsorption/desorption cycles of NH3 the PW core remains intact. Compound 2 can be embedded into thin polyurethane films (2P) under retention of its sensing abilities. Therefore, 2 qualifies as reversible optical probe for ammonia. The magnetochemical switching of 2 and 2&#8901;NH3 was studied in detail by SQUID measurements showing that in 2&#8901;NH3, solely the Ni atom coordinated the NH3 molecule is responsible for the paramagnetic behavior.

         <title>Macrocyclic FKBP51 Ligands Define a Transient Binding Mode with Enhanced Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic FKBP51 ligands reveal a new transient binding pocket for the FK506&#8208;binding protein&#8197;51 and enable the first ligands that also discriminate against the close homologs FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. This macrocyclic motif represents a new scaffold to develop drugs for depression, obesity or chronic pain.







Abstract
Subtype selectivity represents a challenge in many drug discovery campaigns. A typical example is the FK506 binding protein&#8197;51 (FKBP51), which has emerged as an attractive drug target. The most advanced FKBP51 ligands of the SAFit class are highly selective vs. FKBP52 but poorly discriminate against the homologs and off&#8208;targets FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. During a macrocyclization pilot study, we observed that many of these macrocyclic analogs have unanticipated and unprecedented preference for FKBP51 over FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. Structural studies revealed that these macrocycles bind with a new binding mode featuring a transient conformation, which is disfavored for the small FKBPs. Using a conformation&#8208;sensitive assay we show that this binding mode occurs in solution and is characteristic for this new class of compounds. The discovered macrocycles are non&#8208;immunosuppressive, engage FKBP51 in cells, and block the cellular effect of FKBP51 on IKK&#945;. Our findings provide a new chemical scaffold for improved FKBP51 ligands and the structural basis for enhanced selectivity.

         <title>Multicolor Mechanofluorophores for the Quantitative Detection of Covalent Bond Scission in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new platform of dual fluorescent mechanofluorophores that display covalent bond scission during material breakage by changing their optical properties was synthesized. The absorption and emission characteristics were tuned to cover the entire visible spectrum. Using photon quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy, these new mechanofluorophores enabled the quantification of bond scission events with &#956;m resolution.







Abstract
The fracture of polymer materials is a multiscale process starting with the scission of a single molecular bond advancing to a site of failure within the bulk. Quantifying the bonds broken during this process remains a big challenge yet would help to understand the distribution and dissipation of macroscopic mechanical energy. We here show the design and synthesis of fluorogenic molecular optical force probes (mechanofluorophores) covering the entire visible spectrum in both absorption and emission. Their dual fluorescent character allows to track non&#8208;broken and broken bonds in dissolved and bulk polymers by fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Importantly, we develop an approach to determine the absolute number and relative fraction of intact and cleaved bonds with high local resolution. We anticipate that our mechanofluorophores in combination with our quantification methodology will allow to quantitatively describe fracture processes in materials ranging from soft hydrogels to high&#8208;performance polymers.

Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenations of amides and ketones proved viable under mild conditions via bimetallic electrocatalysis. Mechanistic studies revealed a high&#8208;valent dimeric rhodium electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed arene C&#8722;H oxygenation by weakly O&#8208;coordinating amides and ketones have been established by bimetallic electrocatalysis. Likewise, diverse dihydrooxazinones were selectively accessed by the judicious choice of current, enabling twofold C&#8722;H functionalization. Detailed mechanistic studies by experiment, mass spectroscopy and cyclovoltammetric analysis provided support for an unprecedented electrooxidation&#8208;induced C&#8722;H activation by a bimetallic rhodium catalysis manifold.

         <title>The Interrelated Effect of Cations and Electrolyte pH on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction on Gold Electrodes in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold electrodes is affected by the concentration of alkali metal cations and electrolyte pH. At moderately alkaline pH, increasing the cation concentration greatly enhances the HER activity. Cations are proposed to help stabilize the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step by a favorable interaction with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8211;OH&#948;&#8722;&#8211;cat+).







Abstract
In this work we study the role of alkali metal cation concentration and electrolyte pH in altering the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold (Au) electrodes. We show that at moderately alkaline pH (pH&#8197;11), increasing the cation concentration significantly enhances the HER activity on Au electrodes (with a reaction order &#8776;0.5). Based on these results we suggest that cations play a central role in stabilizing the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step by favorably interacting with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8211;OH&#948;&#8722;&#8211;cat+). Moreover, we show that increasing electrolyte pH (pH&#8197;10 to pH&#8197;13) tunes the local field strength, which in turn indirectly enhances the activity of HER by tuning the near&#8208;surface cation concentration. Interestingly, a too high near&#8208;surface cation concentration (at high pH and high cation concentration) leads to a lowering of the HER activity, which we ascribe to a blockage of the surface by near&#8208;surface cations.

         <title>Access to Functionalized Pyrenes, Peropyrenes, Terropyrenes, and Quarterropyrenes via Reductive Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for the modular synthesis of peropyrenes, terropyrenes, and quarterropyrenes via reductive aromatization and silylation key steps is presented. The functionalized members of the ropyrene family are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Optical spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry are discussed in relation to DFT&#8208;calculated frontier molecular orbital energies.







Abstract
Herein we report a versatile concept for the synthesis of fourfold functionalized, soluble pyrenes, peropyrenes, terropyrenes, and quarterropyrenes. They were obtained by a modular stepwise approach towards the rylene scaffold via Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling, oxidative cyclodehydrogenation in the presence of caesium hydroxide under air, and finally zinc&#8208;mediated reductive silylation. The silylated reaction products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The first example of a synthesized and crystallized quarterropyrene is presented and its oxidation reaction investigated. The functionalized ropyrenes were systematically characterized by means of UV/Vis&#8211;NIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy showing a bathochromic shift of 80&#8197;nm per naphthalene unit and a nearly linear increase of the extinction coefficients. Cyclic voltammograms and DFT calculations identify them as electron&#8208;rich dyes and show a narrowing of the electrochemically determined HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and lower oxidation potentials for the higher homologues.

         <title>B&#8211;B vs. B&#8211;H Bond Activation in a (&#956;&#8208;Hydrido)diborane(4) Anion upon Cycloaddition with CO2, Isocyanates, or Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented cycloaddition reactions of two isomeric (hydrido)diborane(4) anions with a homologous heterocumulene series proceed via B&#8211;B or B&#8211;H bond activation. Our diborane starting materials exhibit sterically exposed BHB cores, allowing us to contribute experimental evidence to the body of theoretical work on this class of [B2H5]&#8722; anion analogs.







Abstract
The intriguing (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diboranes(4) with their prominent pristine representative [B2H5]&#8722; have mainly been studied theoretically. We now describe the behavior of the planarized tetraaryl (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane(4) anion [1H]&#8722; in cycloaddition reactions with the homologous series of heterocumulenes CO2, iPrNCO, and iPrNCNiPr. We show that a C=O bond of CO2 selectively activates the B&#8722;B bond of [1H]&#8722;, while the &#956;&#8208;H ligand is left untouched ([2H]&#8722;). The carbodiimide iPrNCNiPr, in contrast, neglects the B&#8722;B bond and rather adds the B&#8208;bonded H&#8722; ion to its central C atom to generate a formamidinate bridge across the B2 pair ([3]&#8722;). As a hybrid, the isocyanate iPrNCO combines the reactivity patterns of both its congeners and gives two products: one of them ([4H]&#8722;) is related to [2H]&#8722;, the other ([5]&#8722;) is an analog of [3]&#8722;. We finally propose a mechanistic scenario that rationalizes the individual reaction outcomes and combines them to a coherent picture of B&#8211;B vs. B&#8211;H bond activation.

         <title>Biosynthesis and Mechanism of Action of the Cell Wall Targeting Antibiotic Hypeptin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonribosomal peptide hypeptin blocks cell wall biosynthesis of gram&#8208;positive bacteria by binding to lipid II. It kills pathogens even in late exponential growth phase without detectable development of resistance. Investigation of the biosynthesis in vitro, combined with bioinformatic and NMR analyses led to the proposal of a refined structure.







Abstract
Hypeptin is a cyclodepsipeptide antibiotic produced by Lysobacter sp. K5869, isolated from an environmental sample by the iChip technology, dedicated to the cultivation of previously uncultured microorganisms. Hypeptin shares structural features with teixobactin and exhibits potent activity against a broad spectrum of gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using comprehensive in vivo and in vitro analyses, we show that hypeptin blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to multiple undecaprenyl pyrophosphate&#8208;containing biosynthesis intermediates, forming a stoichiometric 2:1 complex. Resistance to hypeptin did not readily develop in vitro. Analysis of the hypeptin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) supported a model for the synthesis of the octapeptide. Within the BGC, two hydroxylases were identified and characterized, responsible for the stereoselective &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of four building blocks when bound to peptidyl carrier proteins. In vitro hydroxylation assays corroborate the biosynthetic hypothesis and lead to the proposal of a refined structure for hypeptin.

         <title>Polymorphism and Fast Potassium&#8208;Ion Conduction in the T5 Supertetrahedral Phosphidosilicate KSi2P3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size matters: Only a structure with large T5 supertetrahedra enables fast K+&#8208;ion conduction in the polymorphic phosphidosilicate KSi2P3.







Abstract
The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) is a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. In view of the limited availability of lithium, however, alternative systems based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements are urgently sought. Besides well&#8208;studied sodium compounds, potassium&#8208;based systems offer the advantage of low cost and a large electrochemical window, but are hardly explored. Here we report the synthesis and crystal structure of K&#8208;ion conducting T5 KSi2P3 inspired by recent discoveries of fast ion conductors in alkaline phosphidosilicates. KSi2P3 is composed of SiP4 tetrahedra forming interpenetrating networks of large T5 supertetrahedra. The compound passes through a reconstructive phase transition from the known T3 to the new tetragonal T5 polymorph at 1020&#8201;&#176;C with enantiotropic displacive phase transitions upon cooling at about 155&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C. The potassium ions are located in large channels between the T5 supertetrahedral networks and show facile movement through the structure. The bulk ionic conductivity is up to 2.6&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C with an average activation energy of 0.20&#8197;eV. This is remarkably high for a potassium ion conductor at room temperature, and marks KSi2P3 as the first non&#8208;oxide solid potassium ion conductor.

&lt;p&gt;Size matters: Only a structure with large T5 supertetrahedra enables fast K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;ion conduction in the polymorphic phosphidosilicate KSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (ASSB) is a promising candidate for electrochemical energy storage. In view of the limited availability of lithium, however, alternative systems based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements are urgently sought. Besides well&#8208;studied sodium compounds, potassium&#8208;based systems offer the advantage of low cost and a large electrochemical window, but are hardly explored. Here we report the synthesis and crystal structure of K&#8208;ion conducting T5 KSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; inspired by recent discoveries of fast ion conductors in alkaline phosphidosilicates. KSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is composed of SiP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra forming interpenetrating networks of large T5 supertetrahedra. The compound passes through a reconstructive phase transition from the known T3 to the new tetragonal T5 polymorph at 1020&#8201;&#176;C with enantiotropic displacive phase transitions upon cooling at about 155&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C. The potassium ions are located in large channels between the T5 supertetrahedral networks and show facile movement through the structure. The bulk ionic conductivity is up to 2.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C with an average activation energy of 0.20&#8197;eV. This is remarkably high for a potassium ion conductor at room temperature, and marks KSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the first non&#8208;oxide solid potassium ion conductor.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>NORD: NO Relaxation Delay NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NORD (NO relaxation delay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced and combined with concatenation of experiments in a way making relaxation delays unnecessary and thus enhancing overall sensitivity.







Abstract
The novel concept of NORD (NO relaxation delay) NMR spectroscopy is introduced. The idea is to design concatenated experiments in a way that the magnetization used in the first relaxes toward equilibrium during the second and vice versa, thus saving instrument time. Applications include complete well&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;1H and 1H&#8208;13C one&#8208;bond and long&#8208;range correlation maps of an 80&#8197;mM solution of a trisaccharide recorded in less than two minutes and hydrocortisone with extensive spectral overlap.

         <title>Ligand Controls the Activity of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation Catalyzed by Nickel(II) Porphyrin Complexes in Neutral Homogeneous Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four photostable, tetraanionic nickel(II)&#8208;porphyrin water oxidation catalysts were evaluated in a neutral&#8208;to&#8208;acidic aqueous photocatalytic water oxidation system using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer and [S2O8]2&#8722; as electron acceptor. The best photocatalytic dioxygen evolution was obtained with a well&#8208;balanced electron density on the Ni&#8208;porphyrin catalyst.







Abstract
Finding photostable, first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based molecular systems for photocatalytic water oxidation is a step towards sustainable solar fuel production. Herein, we discovered that nickel(II) hydrophilic porphyrins are molecular catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation in neutral to acidic aqueous solutions using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ as photosensitizer and [S2O8]2&#8722; as sacrificial electron acceptor. Electron&#8208;poorer Ni&#8208;porphyrins bearing 8 fluorine or 4 methylpyridinium substituents as electron&#8208;poorer porphyrins afforded 6&#8208;fold higher turnover frequencies (TOFs; ca. 0.65&#8197;min&#8722;1) than electron&#8208;richer analogues. However, the electron&#8208;poorest Ni&#8208;porphyrin bearing 16 fluorine substituents was photocatalytically inactive under such conditions, because the potential at which catalytic O2 evolution starts was too high (+1.23&#8197;V vs. NHE) to be driven by the photochemically generated [Ru(bpy)3]3+. Critically, these Ni&#8208;porphyrin catalysts showed excellent stability in photocatalytic conditions, as a second photocatalytic run replenished with a new dose of photosensitizer, afforded only 1&#8211;3&#8201;% less O2 than during the first photocatalytic run.

         <title>Covalent Bisfunctionalization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we demonstrate an approach to building up a bisfunctionalized MoS2 hybrid structure through successively treating activated MoS2 with alkyl iodide and aryl diazonium salt. This approach can be used to modify both colloidal and substrate&#8208;supported MoS2 nanosheets.







Abstract
Covalent functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2) holds great promise in developing robust organic&#8208;MoS2 hybrid structures. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate an approach to building up a bisfunctionalized MoS2 hybrid structure through successively reacting activated MoS2 with alkyl iodide and aryl diazonium salts. This approach can be utilized to modify both colloidal and substrate supported MoS2 nanosheets. We have discovered that compared to the adducts formed through the reactions of MoS2 with diazonium salts, those formed through the reactions of MoS2 with alkyl iodides display higher reactivity towards further reactions with electrophiles. We are convinced that our systematic study on the formation and reactivity of covalently functionalized MoS2 hybrids will provide some practical guidance on multi&#8208;angle tailoring of the properties of 2D MoS2 for various potential applications.

         <title>Automated Glycan Assembly of 19F&#8208;labeled Glycan Probes Enables High&#8208;Throughput NMR Studies of Protein&#8211;Glycan Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F&#8208;labeled glycans produced with automated glycan assembly allowed for the high&#8208;throughput NMR screening of protein&#8211;glycan interactions. Binding to mammalian and bacterial lectins as well as enzymes was monitored in real&#8208;time with a fast assay that does not require labeled proteins or complex 2D&#8197;NMR experiments. Previously unknown glycan&#8211;lectin weak interactions were detected, and quantitative data were obtained.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;glycan interactions mediate important biological processes, including pathogen host invasion and cellular communication. Herein, we showcase an expedite approach that integrates automated glycan assembly (AGA) of 19F&#8208;labeled probes and high&#8208;throughput NMR methods, enabling the study of protein&#8211;glycan interactions. Synthetic Lewis type&#8197;2 antigens were screened against seven glycan binding proteins (GBPs), including DC&#8208;SIGN and BambL, respectively involved in HIV&#8208;1 and lung infections in immunocompromised patients, confirming the preference for fucosylated glycans (Lex, H&#8197;type&#8197;2, Ley). Previously unknown glycan&#8211;lectin weak interactions were detected, and thermodynamic data were obtained. Enzymatic reactions were monitored in real&#8208;time, delivering kinetic parameters. These results demonstrate the utility of AGA combined with 19F&#8197;NMR for the discovery and characterization of glycan&#8211;protein interactions, opening up new perspectives for 19F&#8208;labeled complex glycans.

A facile and generalized approach is reported for the modification of solid surfaces with polymer brushes under ambient conditions: filter paper&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;initiated Cu0&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization. A surface&#8208;initiated &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; of the monomer solution wetted filter paper covered with a thin copper plate allows to perform the surface grafting selectively with polymer brushes.







Abstract
We report herein a facile and generalized approach to the modification of solid surfaces with polymer brushes under ambient conditions: filter paper&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;initiated Cu0&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (PSI&#8208;CuCRP). The polymerization solution wetted filter paper is sandwiched between a copper plate and an initiator&#8208;modified substrate, which allows the creation of a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization (SIP) &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; so that everyone can perform the surface grafting selectively with good control over the quality of the polymer brushes employing low concentration and microliter amounts of the monomer solution. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by grafting different homo&#8208;, block&#8208;, and multicomponent polymer brushes by using the same activation system and reaction conditions, the polymerization process can be precisely controlled to yield uniform polymers and show high chain&#8208;end functionality which is exemplified by in situ tetra&#8208;copolymerization. The combination of photolithography and paper cutting enables to prepare arbitrary three&#8208;dimensional patterned polymer brushes on the surface.

         <title>Folded Perylene Diimide Loops as Mechanoresponsive Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A supramolecular mechanophore that can be integrated into polymers and indicate deformation by a fluorescence color change is reported. Two perylene diimides (PDIs) were connected by a short spacer and equipped with peripheral atom transfer polymerization initiators. In the idle state, the motif folds into a loop and its emission is excimer dominated. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) chains were grown from the motif and the mechanophore&#8208;containing polymer was blended with unmodified PMA to afford materials that display a visually discernible fluorescence color change upon deformation, which causes the loops to unfold. The response is instant, and correlates linearly with the applied strain. Experiments with a reference polymer containing only one PDI moiety show that looped mechanophores that display intramolecular excimer formation offer considerable advantages over intermolecular dye aggregates, including a concentration&#8208;independent response, direct signaling of mechanical processes, and a more pronounced optical change.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative and Multiplexed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Intercellular Tensile Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanical interactions between cells have been shown to play critical roles in regulating cell signaling and communications. However, the precise measurement of intercellular forces is still quite challenging, especially considering the complex environment at cell&#8211;cell junctions. In this study, we report a fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based approach to image and quantify intercellular molecular tensions. Using this method, tensile forces among multiple ligand&#8208;receptor pairs can be measured simultaneously. We first validated our approach and developed lifetime measurement&#8208;based DNA tension probes to image E&#8208;cadherin&#8208;mediated tension on epithelial cells. These probes were then further applied to quantify the correlations between E&#8208;cadherin and N&#8208;cadherin tensions during an epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition process. The modular design of these probes can potentially be used to study the mechanical features of various physiological and pathological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of Hexaazatrinaphthylene Based 2D Conjugated Copper Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective and Stable Electroreduction of CO&#8288;2&#8288; to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D conjugated MOFs have attracted significant interests in recent years owing to their special structural features and promising physical and chemical properties. These intriguing attributes, to a large extent, stem from the nature of incorporated ligands. The available ligands for the construction of 2D conjugated MOFs are still limited, especially those have heteroatoms included and exposed to the pores. In this work, we designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA) based ligand with two different coordination sites. Through selective coordination, a highly crystalline and porous 2D conjugated copper metal&#8208;organic framework was constructed. Due to the synergic effects of HATNA and copper catecholate node, this HATNA based 2D conjugated MOF can mediate the electrocatalytic reduction CO2  to methane with high selectivity of 78% at high current density of 8.2 milliamperes per square centimetre (mA cm  &#8208;2  ) for long durability over 12 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic upgrading of lignin oil to diesel precursor and hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C&#8722;C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co&#8208;generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4 mmol g  catal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  dimers and 1.6 mmol g  catal  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  H  2  were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 times and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16&#8208;C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin&#8208;to&#8208;diesel route.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Highly Efficient Rare&#8208;Earth Element&#8208;Free Red/Green/Blue Solid&#8208;State Bandgap Fluorescent Carbon Quantum Rings for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare&#8208;earth element (REE)&#8208;based materials are commonly used in phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the negative impact of their use on the environment, human health, supply risks, and high cost prompts the need for REE&#8208;free materials. Here, we report the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of red/green/blue solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescent carbon quantum rings (R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQRs) with high quantum yields&#160;up to&#160;30&#8208;46%. This was achieved using cyano&#8208;group&#8208;bearing p&#8208;phenyldiacetonitrile and aldehyde&#8208;group&#8208;bearing terephthalaldehyde as precursors and forming carbon quantum rings of different diameters through the linkage of curved carbon quantum ribbons of different lengths. The results show the role of cyano groups in the curvature of carbon quantum ribbons for CQR formation and emission of stable solid&#8208;state bandgap fluorescence. R/G/B&#8208;SBF&#8208;CQR&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs emitted warm white light with low correlated color temperature (3576 K), high color rendering index (96.6), and high luminous efficiency (48.7 lm W  &#8208;1  ), comparable to REE&#8208;phosphor&#8208;based LEDs.

Abstract
We reply to the comment by J.&#8208;M. Mewes, A. Hansen and S. Grimme (MHG), who challenged the accuracy of our re value for the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te distance in (C6F5)Te(CH2)3NMe2 determined by gas electron diffraction (GED). We conclusively demonstrate that MHG&#8242;s quoted reference calculations are less accurate than they claim for solid state and gas phase. We show by higher level calculations, that we did not miss substantial contributions from open&#8208;chain conformers. Refinements on simulated scattering data show that such contributions would have had only an almost negligible effect on re(N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te). MHG suggested the use of a H0&#8208;tuned GFN method for calculating vibrational corrections ra&#8722;re, but this did not change these values substantially. Alternative amplitude calculations using higher level analytic harmonic and numeric cubic force fields (PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP) yield a GED value for re(N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te)=2.852(25)&#8197;&#197; that is well within the experimental error of our original value 2.918(31)&#8197;&#197; but far from the 2.67(8)&#8197;&#197; predicted by MHG. A now improved error estimation accounts for inaccuracies in the calculated auxiliary values. The gas/solid difference of the weak N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interaction is in a realistic range compared to other systems involving weak chemical interactions.

Abstract
Mitzel and co&#8208;workers recently presented an intriguing molecule displaying a tellurium&#8211;nitrogen interaction. Structural data obtained in the solid and in gas phase indicated a large increase of the Te&#8211;N equilibrium distance re from 2.64 to 2.92&#8197;&#197;, respectively. Although some DFT calculations appear to support the large re in gas phase, we argue that the lions share of the increase is due to an incomplete description of finite&#8208;temperature effects in the back&#8208;corrected experimental data. This hypothesis is based on high&#8208;level coupled&#8208;cluster (CC) and periodic DFT calculations, which consistently point towards a much smaller re in the isolated molecule. Further support comes through MD simulations with a tuned GFN2&#8208;xTB Hamiltonian: Calibrated against a CC reference, these show a six&#8208;times larger influence of temperature than with the originally used GFN1&#8208;xTB. Taking this into account, the back&#8208;corrected re in gas phase becomes 2.67&#177;0.08&#8197;&#197;, in good agreement with high&#8208;level CC theory and most DFT methods.

         <title>Reduced Arene Complexes of Hafnium Supported by a Triamidoamine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reduced anthracene complex of hafnium(IV) reacts with two equivalents of benzonitrile to form the hafnium&#8208;bis(iminyl) as the kinetic product that expulses one equivalent of benzonitrile to give an imido complex.







Abstract
A series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of the general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N3N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;, L=THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene=C10H82&#8722;, C14H102&#8722;) mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N3N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of tert&#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;Ketoacylsilanes with Imines: Facile Access to &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams from &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes and imines is reported, which proceeds via a [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene. This reaction proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion with broad substrate scope, including aldimines, ketimines, hydrazones, and fused nitrogen heterocycles, and good functional&#8208;group tolerance, affording a variety of &#946;&#8208;lactams with satisfactory diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;lactams from &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes and imines, which proceeds via a formal [2+2] photochemical cycloaddition with in situ generation of siloxyketene. This mild and operationally simple reaction proceeds in an atom&#8208;economic fashion with broad substrate scope, including aldimines, ketimines, hydrazones, and fused nitrogen heterocycles, affording a variety of important &#946;&#8208;lactams with satisfactory diastereoselectivities in most cases. This reaction also features good functional&#8208;group tolerance, facile scalability and product diversification. Experimental and computational studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;ketoacylsilanes can serve as photochemical precursors by engaging in a 1,3 silicon shift to the distal carbonyl group.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Pairing Approach to Stereoselective Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is achieved by non&#8208;covalent interactions, such as ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics and solvation effects, in a metal&#8208;free condition.







Abstract
Stereochemistry can have a profound impact on polymer and materials properties. Unfortunately, straightforward methods for realizing high levels of stereocontrolled polymerizations are often challenging to achieve. In a departure from traditional metal&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), we discovered a remarkably simple method for controlling alkene stereochemistry in photoredox mediated metal&#8208;free ROMP. Ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics, and solvation effects each had profound impact on the stereochemistry of polynorbornene (PNB). Simple modifications to the reaction conditions produced PNB with trans alkene content of 25 to &gt;98&#8201;%. High cis content was obtained from relatively larger counterions, toluene as solvent, low temperatures (&#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C), and initiators with low Charton values. Conversely, smaller counterions, dichloromethane as solvent, and enol ethers with higher Charton values enabled production of PNB with high trans content. Data from a combined experimental and computational investigation are consistent with the stereocontrolling step of the radical cationic mechanism proceeding under thermodynamic control.

         <title>Red Light&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Carbon Monoxide Release Enables Selective Eradication of MRSA Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free CO&#8208;releasing micelles can be selectively taken up by Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, exerting a narrow&#8208;spectrum bactericidal activity toward only Gram&#8208;positive bacteria under red light irradiation. The CO&#8208;releasing micelles synergistically eradicate MRSA pathogens and accelerate MRSA&#8208;infected wound healing.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an important gaseous signaling molecule. The use of CO&#8208;releasing molecules such as metal carbonyls enables the elucidation of the pleiotropic functions of CO. Although metal carbonyls show a broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity, it remains unclear whether the bactericidal property originates from the transition metals or the released CO. Here, we develop nonmetallic CO&#8208;releasing micelles via a photooxygenation mechanism of 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone derivatives, enabling CO release under red light irradiation (e.g., 650&#8197;nm). Unlike metal carbonyls that non&#8208;specifically internalize into both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, the nonmetallic micelles are selectively taken up by S. aureus instead of E. coli cells, exerting a selective bactericidal effect. Further, we demonstrate that the CO&#8208;releasing micelles can cure methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected wounds, simultaneously eradicating MRSA pathogens and accelerating wound healing.

         <title>Tuneable Control of Organocatalytic Activity through Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding an organocatalyst inside a cucurbituril molecular host can reversibly up&#8208; or downregulate catalytic activity, which is demonstrated in temporal control over the rate of a range of organocatalyzed transformations.







Abstract
Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks, such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. We present a host&#8208;guest chemistry strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. In most cases CB[7] encapsulation results in catalyst inhibition, however in one case catalyst activation by binding to CB[7] was observed. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and pKa measurements. The catalytic activity can be instantaneously switched during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and the reaction rate can be predicted with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity.

         <title>Atomic Sulfur Filling Oxygen Vacancies Optimizes H Absorption and Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;atom doping of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 results in the occupation of the oxygen vacancies. S sites in the S&#8208;NiFe2O4 likely adsorb H adatoms and form S&#8208;H* in situ, which boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that the lowered energy barrier for H2O dissociation induced by S doping is the key reason for the remarkable HER performance.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually has sluggish kinetics in alkaline solution due to the difficulty in forming binding protons. Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (VO) of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (S&#8208;NiFe2O4) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61&#8197;mV at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 60&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;Acm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S&#8208;H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H2O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S&#8208;NiFe2O4.

         <title>Effect of the Ligand Backbone on the Reactivity and Mechanistic Paradigm of Non&#8208;Heme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo during Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric and electronic effects exerted by the bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) in the non&#8208;heme complex [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ play a key role in olefin epoxidation by oxygen atom transfer and trigger mechanistic diversification. In the present study, the mechanism of olefin epoxidation was thoroughly investigated and rationalized with a detailed computational study.







Abstract
The oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity of the non&#8208;heme [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ (2) containing the sterically bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) has been thoroughly studied with different olefins. The ferryl&#8208;oxo complex 2 shows excellent OAT reactivity during epoxidations. The steric encumbrance and electronic effect of the ligand influence the mechanistic shuttle between OAT pathway I and isomerization pathway II (during the reaction stereo pure olefins), resulting in a mixture of cis&#8208;trans epoxide products. In contrast, the sterically less hindered and electronically different [FeIV(N4Py)(O)]2+ (1) provides only cis&#8208;stilbene epoxide. A Hammett study suggests the role of dominant inductive electronic along with minor resonance effect during electron transfer from olefin to 2 in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Additionally, a computational study supports the involvement of stepwise pathways during olefin epoxidation. The ferryl bend due to the bulkier ligand incorporation leads to destabilization of both 
 and 
 orbitals, leading to a very small quintet&#8211;triplet gap and enhanced reactivity for 2 compared to 1. Thus, the present study unveils the role of steric and electronic effects of the ligand towards mechanistic modification during olefin epoxidation

         <title>LiZn(OH)CO3: A Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Hydroxycarbonate Designed from a Diamond&#8208;like Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate LiZn(OH)CO3 was obtained by structural design. LiZn(OH)CO3 exhibits a large SHG response, a wide band gap and a large birefringence, achieving the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength among all reported NLO carbonates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are vital to the development of science and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies, but the exploration of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the contradiction between NLO effect and energy band gap as well as the sensitivity of DUV phase&#8208;matching to optical birefringence. Here, in order to achieve a well balanced DUV NLO performance, we chose the diamond&#8208;like structure as the prototype template for the material design and synthesized the first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate crystal, LiZn(OH)CO3. This compound simultaneously has a wide band gap (&gt;6.53&#8197;eV), a strong second harmonic generation response (ca. 3.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.147 at 1064&#8197;nm) with the shortest DUV phase&#8208;matching capability (&#955;PM&lt;190&#8197;nm) among all reported NLO carbonates. Moreover, the structure&#8211;property relationships in LiZn(OH)CO3 are analyzed by first&#8208;principles calculations. This work presents an effective design strategy to push the NLO performance of hydroxycarbonates into the DUV region.

&lt;p&gt;The first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate LiZn(OH)CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained by structural design. LiZn(OH)CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a large SHG response, a wide band gap and a large birefringence, achieving the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength among all reported NLO carbonates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are vital to the development of science and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies, but the exploration of these important optoelectronic materials is hindered by the contradiction between NLO effect and energy band gap as well as the sensitivity of DUV phase&#8208;matching to optical birefringence. Here, in order to achieve a well balanced DUV NLO performance, we chose the diamond&#8208;like structure as the prototype template for the material design and synthesized the first DUV NLO hydroxycarbonate crystal, LiZn(OH)CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This compound simultaneously has a wide band gap (&amp;gt;6.53&#8197;eV), a strong second harmonic generation response (ca. 3.2&#215;KDP), and a large birefringence (0.147 at 1064&#8197;nm) with the shortest DUV phase&#8208;matching capability (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PM&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;190&#8197;nm) among all reported NLO carbonates. Moreover, the structure&#8211;property relationships in LiZn(OH)CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are analyzed by first&#8208;principles calculations. This work presents an effective design strategy to push the NLO performance of hydroxycarbonates into the DUV region.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes from Flex&#8208;Activated Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of flex&#8208;activated mechanophore, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8211;carbodiimide adduct (NHC&#8208;CDI), was developed as a platform to release different NHCs under mechanical load. The polymeric materials containing NHC&#8208;CDI can be subjected to multiple compression cycles and successively release NHCs, which have potential to be utilized as self&#8208;healing, self&#8208;strengthening and self&#8208;reporting materials.







Abstract
We have discovered a new flex&#8208;activated mechanophore that releases an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) under mechanical load. The mechanophore design is based upon NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts and demonstrates an important first step toward flex&#8208;activated designs capable of further downstream reactivities. Since the flex&#8208;activation is non&#8208;destructive to the main polymer chains, the material can be subjected to multiple compression cycles to achieve iterative increases in the activation percentage of mechanophores. Two different NHC structures were demonstrated, signifying the potential modularity of the mechanophore design.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Pentagon&#8208; and Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Nanographene Containing a Central Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;milligram&#8208;scale synthesis of the first example of a bowl&#8208;shaped nanographene with a pyrrolo&#8208;pyrrole core has been achieved via sequential, programmed, intramolecular direct arylations. This curved molecule possesses an inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology (a combination of fused pentagons and heptagons), small bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion barrier, high&#8208;lying HOMO, weak red&#8208;emission at 615&#8197;nm, and a small dipole moment.







Abstract
A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another has been prepared via a concise synthetic strategy encompassing the multicomponent tetraarylpyrrolopyrrole (TAPP) synthesis, the Scholl reaction, and intramolecular direct arylation. This synthesis represents the first case of programmed sequential intramolecular direct arylation reactions utilizing the different reactivity of C&#8211;Br and C&#8211;Cl bonds. The target compound contains two central pentagons confined between two adjacent heptagons&#8212;the inverse Stone&#8211;Thrower&#8211;Wales topology. The presence of both five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings in the final structure is responsible for interesting properties such as a perpendicularly aligned dipole moment, absorption and fluorescence in the orange&#8208;red region, weak emission originating from the charge&#8208;transfer character of a low&#8208;energy absorption band, and a high lying HOMO. In the solid state slipped convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking dominates.

         <title>Catalytic Oxygenation of Hydrocarbons by Mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo Dicopper(II) Species Resulting from O&#8722;O Cleavage of Tetranuclear CuI/CuII Peroxo Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopies complemented by XAS and UHR&#8208;ESI mass spectrometry are employed to monitor the binding of O2 in a tetranuclear copper cluster, followed by homolytic O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The resulting mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper(II) complexes catalytically oxygenate a variety of hydrocarbons, establishing an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the monooxygenation of organic substrates from gaseous O2.







Abstract
One of the challenges of catalysis is the transformation of inert C&#8722;H bonds to useful products. Copper&#8208;containing monooxygenases play an important role in this regard. Here we show that low&#8208;temperature oxygenation of dinuclear copper(I) complexes leads to unusual tetranuclear, mixed&#8208;valent &#956;4&#8208;peroxo [CuI/CuII]2 complexes. These Cu4O2 intermediates promote irreversible and thermally activated O&#8722;O bond homolysis, generating Cu2O complexes that catalyze strongly exergonic H&#8208;atom abstraction from hydrocarbons, coupled to O&#8208;transfer. The Cu2O species can also be produced with N2O, demonstrating their capability for small&#8208;molecule activation. The binding and cleavage of O2 leading to the primary Cu4O2 intermediate and the Cu2O complexes, respectively, is elucidated with a range of solution spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The unique reactivities of these species establish an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the catalytic, copper&#8208;mediated monooxygenation of organic substrates, employing both O&#8208;atoms of O2.

         <dc:description>A synthetic pathway for the synthesis of novel anionic sandwich complexes with a cyclo&#8208;E  3  (E = P, As) ligand as an end deck was developed giving [Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co(   &#951;    3    &#8208;E  3  )]  &#8208;  (Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = 1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, E = P ([  5  ]), As ([  6  ])) in good yields suitable for further reactivity studies. In the reaction with the chlorophosphanes R  2  PCl (R = Ph, Cy,  t  Bu), neutral complexes with a disubstituted cyclo&#8208;E  3  P (E = P, As) ligand in [Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co(   &#951;    3    &#8208;E  3  PR  2  )] (E = P (  7a  &#8208;  c  ), As (  9a  &#8208;  c  )) were obtained.

         <title>Transformation pathway from CdSe magic&#8208;size clusters with absorption doublets at 373/393 nm to clusters at 434/460 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent interpretations have appeared in the literature regarding the structural nature and evolutionary behavior for photoluminescent CdSe nano&#8208;species with sharp doublets in optical absorption. Here, we report a comprehensive description of the transformation pathway from one CdSe nano&#8208;species displaying an absorption doublet at 373/393 nm to another species with a doublet at 433/460 nm. These two nano&#8208;species are shown to be as zero&#8208;dimension (0D) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) with 3D quantum confinement, and are labelled dMSC&#8208;393 and dMSC&#8208;460, respectively. Synchrotron&#8208;based small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) returns a radius of gyration of 0.92 nm for dMSC&#8208;393 and 1.14 nm for dMSC&#8208;460,  and indicates that both types are disc&#8208;shaped with the exponent of the SAXS form factor equal to 2.1.  The MSCs develop from their unique counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are labelled PC&#8208;393 and PC&#8208;460, respectively. For the dMSC&#8208;393 to dMSC&#8208;460 transformation, the proposed PC&#8208;enabled pathway is comprised of three key steps, dMSC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;393 (Step 1), PC&#8208;393 to PC&#8208;460 (Step 2 involving monomer addition), and PC&#8208;460 to dMSC&#8208;460 (Step 3). The present study provides a framework for understanding the PC&#8208;based evolution of MSCs and how PCs enable transformations between MSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation and Purification of Hydrocarbons with Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on the developments of adsorbents for the separation and purification of hydrocarbons from, for example, methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, and propene/propane mixtures as well as for the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers).







Abstract
This Minireview focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and porous organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.

Hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) poses a severe threat to public health and social development. Here, we synthesized 4&#177;0.5&#8197;nm copper (I) sulfide (Cu2S) nanoparticles (NPs) with 46 mdeg chiroptical property at 530&#8197;nm to selectively cleavage HBV core antigen (HBcAg) and effectively blocked HBV assembly and prevented HBV infection both in vitro and in vivo under light at 808&#8197;nm.

Experimental analysis showed that the chiral Cu2S NPs specific bound with the functional domain from phenylalanine23 (F23) to leucine30 (L30) from HBcAg primary sequence and the cutting site was between amino acid residues F24 and proline25 (P25). Under excitation at 808&#8197;nm, the intracellular HBcAg concentration was reduced by 95&#8201;%, and in HBV transgenic mice, the levels of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA were decreased by 93&#8201;% and 86&#8201;%, respectively. Together, these results reveal the potential nanomedicine for HBV control and provide fresh tools for viral infection.

         <title>Efficient (&gt;20&#8201;%) and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Cesium Lead Triiodide Solar Cell Enabled by Thiocyanate Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt was introduced as the additive in all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide solar cell, which modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8722; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film. Thus, the UAT&#8208;based devices can provide an encouraging PCE up to 20.08&#8201;% with excellent operational stability of over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Besides widely used surface passivation, engineering the film crystallization is an important and more fundamental route to improve the performance of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells. Herein, we have developed a urea&#8208;ammonium thiocyanate (UAT) molten salt modification strategy to fully release and exploit coordination activities of SCN&#8722; to deposit high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 film for efficient and stable all&#8208;inorganic solar cells. The UAT is derived by the hydrogen bond interactions between urea and NH4+ from NH4SCN. With the UAT, the crystal quality of the CsPbI3 film has been significantly improved and a long single&#8208;exponential charge recombination lifetime of over 30&#8197;ns has been achieved. With these benefits, the cell efficiency has been promoted to over 20&#8201;% (steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.2&#8201;%) with excellent operational stability over 1000&#8197;h. These results demonstrate a promising development route of the CsPbI3 related photoelectric devices.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoroalkylation of Arylborates with Sulfone Reagents: Beyond the Limitation of Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination of low&#8208;valent iron to the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones can overcome the reduction potential limitation in intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes, thus enabling sulfones with low reduction potentials to efficiently participate in radical cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;aryl coupling reaction between sulfones and arylboron compounds has remained a challenge. We report the first iron&#8208;catalyzed radical difluoroalkylation of arylborates with N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones. The coordination between the iron catalyst and the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones was identified to be important in overcoming the reduction potential limitation of sulfones in the intermolecular single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, which enables both fluoroalkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with relatively high reduction potentials) and nonfluorinated alkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with low reduction potentials) to serve as powerful alkylation reagents.

         <title>Chemical Evolution of Antivirals Against Enterovirus D68 through Protein&#8208;Templated Knoevenagel Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organized virus killing: Antivirals are generated through aldol condensations catalyzed by the 3C protease of enterovirus D68 and inhibit viral proliferation in infected human cells. Best inhibitors are slow and sticky. The process demonstrates a potentially native mechanism for the evolution of functional bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The generation of bioactive molecules from inactive precursors is a crucial step in the chemical evolution of life, however, mechanistic insights into this aspect of abiogenesis are scarce. Here, we investigate the protein&#8208;catalyzed formation of antivirals by the 3C&#8208;protease of enterovirus D68. The enzyme induces aldol condensations yielding inhibitors with antiviral activity in cells. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that the bioactivity emerges from a dynamic reaction system including inhibitor formation, alkylation of the protein target by the inhibitors, and competitive addition of non&#8208;protein nucleophiles to the inhibitors. The most active antivirals are slowly reversible inhibitors with elongated target residence times. The study reveals first examples for the chemical evolution of bio&#8208;actives through protein&#8208;catalyzed, non&#8208;enzymatic C&#8722;C couplings. The discovered mechanism works under physiological conditions and might constitute a native process of drug development.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Binding Molecular Photothermal Agent for Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;binding molecular photothermal agent was developed for photothermal therapy. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the intracellular bioactive proteins and induced apoptosis under low power density laser irradiation. The therapeutic effect can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy usually requires a high power density to activate photothermal agent for effective treatment, which inevitably leads to damage to normal tissues and inflammation in tumor tissues. Herein, we rationally design a protein&#8208;binding strategy to build a molecular photothermal agent for photothermal ablation of tumor. The synthesized photothermal agent can covalently bind to the thiol groups on the intracellular proteins. The heat generated by the photothermal agent directly destroyed the bioactive proteins in the cells, effectively reducing the heat loss and the molecular leakage. Under a low power density of 0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the temperature produced by the photothermal agent was sufficient to induce apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the therapeutic effect of photothermal therapy can be efficiently improved with the protein&#8208;binding strategy.

         <title>Orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller Isomerism in the Dark&#8208;Stable State of Nature's Water Oxidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark&#8208;stable resting state of the biological oxygen&#8208;evolving complex is shown to accommodate a rare type of functionally important MnIII orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism that is identified as the electronic origin of subsequent valence isomerism in the catalytic cycle of water oxidation.







Abstract
The tetramanganese&#8211;calcium cluster of the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex of photosystem II adopts electronically and magnetically distinct but interconvertible valence isomeric forms in its first light&#8208;driven oxidized catalytic state, S2. This bistability is implicated in gating the final catalytic states preceding O&#8722;O bond formation, but it is unknown how the biological system enables its emergence and controls its effect. Here we show that the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the resting (dark&#8208;stable) S1 state adopts orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomeric forms arising from a directional change in electronic configuration of the &#8220;dangler&#8221; MnIII ion. The isomers are consistent with available structural data and explain previously unresolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic observations on the S1 state. This unique isomerism in the resting state is shown to be the electronic origin of valence isomerism in the S2 state, establishing a functional role of orientational Jahn&#8211;Teller isomerism unprecedented in biological or artificial catalysis.

         <title>The Unusual Homodimer of a Heme&#8208;Copper Terminal Oxidase Allows Itself to Utilize Two Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3.4&#8197;&#197; structure of cytochrome c oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (AaCcO) has been solved. The molecular mechanism that AaCcO uses involves both cytochrome c and quinol as electron donors through the native quinol molecules (NQs) bound at the dimeric interface.







Abstract
The heme&#8208;copper oxidase superfamily comprises cytochrome c and ubiquinol oxidases. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of electrons from different electron donors onto molecular oxygen. A B&#8208;family cytochrome c oxidase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus was discovered previously to be able to use both cytochrome c and naphthoquinol as electron donors. Its molecular mechanism as well as the evolutionary significance are yet unknown. Here we solved its 3.4&#8197;&#197; resolution electron cryo&#8208;microscopic structure and discovered a novel dimeric structure mediated by subunit I (CoxA2) that would be essential for naphthoquinol binding and oxidation. The unique structural features in both proton and oxygen pathways suggest an evolutionary adaptation of this oxidase to its hyperthermophilic environment. Our results add a new conceptual understanding of structural variation of cytochrome c oxidases in different species.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ketones from Methyl Esters by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl esters are shown to participate in intermolecular Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Due to the mild nature of organoboron reagents, the product ketones are inert to the reaction conditions, avoiding over reactivity issues prominent with more aggressive organometallic nucleophiles.







Abstract
The direct conversion of alkyl esters to ketones has been hindered by the sluggish reactivity of the starting materials and the susceptibility of the product towards subsequent nucleophilic attack. We have now achieved a cross&#8208;coupling approach to this transformation using nickel, a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, and alkyl organoboron coupling partners. 65 alkyl ketones bearing diverse functional groups and heterocyclic scaffolds have been synthesized with this method. Catalyst&#8208;controlled chemoselectivity is observed for C(acyl)&#8722;O bond activation of multi&#8208;functional substrates bearing other bonds prone to cleavage by Ni, including aryl ether, aryl fluoride, and N&#8208;Ph amide functional groups. Density functional theory calculations provide mechanistic support for a Ni0/NiII catalytic cycle and demonstrate how stabilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions between the bulky catalyst and substrate are critical for the reaction's success.

         <title>Bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;Nanotube with Tunable Helicity and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the fabrication of an exotic bamboo&#8208;like &#960;&#8208;nanotube via the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of a dipeptide&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide gelator with tunable helicity and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). It was found that in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) the gelator molecule self&#8208;assembled into a bamboo&#8208;like nanotube, which is composed of truncated nanocones and CPL active. When defining the diameter ratio of the lower to upper edge of each nanocone as a parameter to express the helicity of different nanotubes, it was found that both the helicity and CPL of these nanotubes can be adjusted by the amount of TFA. Moreover, the helicity of the nanotube can be conveyed to the achiral quantum dots (QDs) and produce a hybrid nanotube/QDs CPL active materials with adjustable dissymmetry factor. This work finds a new type self&#8208;assembled bamboo&#8208;like nanotube and unveiled their helicity and CPL control.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Complex Lipids for Fluid&#8211;Fluid Phase Separation in Coassembled Phospholipid Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly of metal complex lipids with DMPC demonstrates a very rare fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation up to 37&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
We demonstrate a fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation in 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DMPC) membranes using a metal complex lipid of type [Mn(L1)] (1; HL1=1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxybenzamide)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecyloxybenzylideneamino)ethane). Small amount of 1 produces two separated domains in DMPC, whose phase transition temperatures of lipids (Tc) are both lower than that of the pristine DMPC. Variable temperature fluorescent microscopy for giant&#8208;unilamellar vesicles of DMPC/1 hybrids demonstrates that visible phase separations remain in fluid phases up to 37&#8201;&#176;C, which is clearly over the Tc of DMPC. This provides a new dimension for the application of metal complex lipids toward controlling lipid distributions in fluid membranes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Emitting Metal&#8211;Organic Halide 1D and 2D Structures: Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Efficiency, Low&#8208;Loss Optical Waveguide and Highly Polarized Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides of (DTA)2SbCl5&#8901;DTAC (DTAC=dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) with near unity photoluminescence quantum yields are reported. Tuning of the organic groups associated with these hybrid materials brought about changes to their 1D and 2D morphology. The anisotropic structures demonstrated polarized emission and may be applied as low&#8208;loss waveguides.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic metal&#8208;halide materials (OIMMs) with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures offer useful optical properties with a wide range of applications. However, successful examples of 0D structural OIMMs with well&#8208;defined optical performance at the micro&#8208;/nanometer scale are limited. We prepared one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DTA)2SbCl5&#8901;DTAC (DTAC=dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride) single&#8208;crystal microrods and 2D microplates with a 0D structure in which individual (SbCl5)2&#8722; quadrangular units are completely isolated and surrounded by the organic cation DTA+. The organic molecular unit with a long alkyl chain (C12) and three methyl groups enables microrod and &#8208;plate formation. The single&#8208;crystal microrods/&#8208;plates exhibit a broadband orange emission peak at 610&#8197;nm with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ca. 90&#8201;% and a large Stokes shift of 260&#8197;nm under photoexcitation. The broad emission originates from self&#8208;trapping excitons. Spatially resolved PL spectra confirm that these microrods exhibit an optical waveguide effect with a low loss coefficient (0.0019&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1) during propagation, and linear polarized photoemission with a polarization contrast (0.57).

         <title>A Supported Pd2 Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported Pd2 dual&#8208;atom site catalyst (DAC) was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). It exhibited superior CO2RR catalytic performance with 98.2&#8201;% CO faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd1 SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DACs) have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis because the synergistic effect between adjacent metal atoms can promote their catalytic activity while maintaining the advantages of single&#8208;atom site catalysts (SACs), like 100&#8201;% atomic utilization efficiency and excellent selectivity. Herein, a supported Pd2 DAC was synthesized and used for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the first time. The as&#8208;obtained Pd2 DAC exhibited superior CO2RR catalytic performance with 98.2&#8201;% CO faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, far exceeding that of Pd1 SAC, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the intrinsic reason for the superior activity of Pd2 DAC toward CO2RR was the electron transfer between Pd atoms at the dimeric Pd sites. Thus, Pd2 DAC possessed moderate adsorption strength of CO*, which was beneficial for CO production in CO2RR.

         <title>Mode&#8208;Specific Vibrational Analysis of Exciton Delocalization and Structural Dynamics in Conjugated Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed pictures of exciton delocalization and structural dynamics of archetypical conjugated oligomers are provided with the aid of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy. Raman frequency dispersions in the S1 state and their time&#8208;dependent kinetics suggest the close connection between exciton delocalization and local structures of conjugated materials.







Abstract
Exciton delocalization in organic semiconducting polymers, affected by structures at a molecular level, plays a crucial role in modulating relaxation pathways, such as charge generation and singlet fission, which can boost device efficiency. However, the structural diversity of polymers and broad signals from typical electronic spectroscopy have their limits when it comes to revealing the interplay between local structures and exciton delocalization. To tackle these problems, we apply femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy in archetypical conjugated oligothiophenes with different chain lengths. We observed Raman frequency dispersions of symmetric bond stretching modes and mode&#8208;specific kinetics in the S1 Raman spectra, which underpins the subtle and complex interplay between exciton delocalization and bond length alternation along the conjugation coordinate. Our results provide a more general picture of exciton delocalization in the context of molecular structures for conjugated materials.

         <title>Interfering with Metabolic Profile of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancers Using Rationally Designed Metformin Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuIII prodrugs of anti&#8208;diabetic medicines metformin and phenformin were developed. These compounds effectively decreased triple negative breast tumor burden. The mode of action of novel complexes was linked to energetic crisis and abolishment of pro&#8208;survival responses leading to irreversible cell death.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, characterized by an aberrant metabolic phenotype with high metastatic capacity, resulting in poor patient prognoses and low survival rates. We designed a series of novel AuIII cyclometalated prodrugs of energy&#8208;disrupting Type II antidiabetic drugs namely, metformin and phenformin. Prodrug activation and release of the metformin ligand was achieved by tuning the cyclometalated AuIII fragment. The lead complex 3met was 6000&#8208;fold more cytotoxic compared to uncoordinated metformin and significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with aggressive breast cancers with lymphocytic infiltration into tumor tissues. These effects was ascribed to 3met interfering with energy production in TNBCs and inhibiting associated pro&#8208;survival responses to induce deadly metabolic catastrophe.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Counting and Superresolution Mapping of Tetraspanins on Exosomes Using a Single&#8208;Molecule Sensitive Flow Technique and Transistor&#8208;like Semiconducting Polymer Dots</title>

         <dc:description>
An approach is described for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes, using a combination of a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method enabled by a new class of transistor&#8208;like, photoswitching polymer dots.







Abstract
A method for high&#8208;throughput counting and superresolution mapping of surface proteins on exosomes is described. The method combines a single&#8208;molecule sensitive flow technique and an adaptive superresolution imaging method. Exosomes stained with membrane dye and dye&#8208;conjugated antibodies were analyzed using a microfluidic platform at a flow rate of 100&#8197;exosome&#8201;s&#8722;1 to determine size and protein copy number. Superresolution mapping was performed with exosomes labeled with novel transistor&#8208;like, semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots), which exhibit spontaneous blinking with &lt;5&#8197;nm localization error and a broad range of optical&#8208;adjustable duty cycles. Based on the copy numbers extracted from the flow analysis, the switch&#8208;on frequency of the Pdots were finely adjusted so that structures of hundreds of exosomes were obtained within five minutes. The high throughput and high sensitivity of this method offer clear advantages for characterization of exosomes and similar biological vesicles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and novel AgI&#8208;catalyzed methodology for the synthesis of multisubstituted 4&#8208;silyloxypyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates with broad variability for the placement of substituents at the 2, 5&#8208;, and N&#8208;positions is presented. Convenient conversion of imino ethers to fully substituted pyrroles with uniformly high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;O band cleavage/[1,5]&#8208;proton transfer cascade process.







Abstract
An unprecedented AgI&#8208;catalyzed efficient method for the coupling of imino ethers and enol diazoacetates through a [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;O bond cleavage/[1,5]&#8208;proton transfer cascade process is reported. The general class of imino ethers that includes oxazolines, benzoxazoles and benzimidates are applicable substrates for these reactions that provide direct access to fully substituted pyrroles with uniformly high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. High variability in substitution at the pyrrole 2&#8208;, 5&#8208; and N&#8208;positions characterizes this methodology that also presents an entry point for further pyrrole diversification via facile modification of resulting N&#8208;functional pyrroles.

Methyl&#8208;group NMR spectroscopy offers exceptional benefits for structural studies of complex biological systems. Yet, restrictive isotope labeling requirements obstructed its use in emerging protein expression systems. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016070), Manuel Etzkorn, Vladimir Gelev, Haribabu Arthanari, and co&#8208;worker report a five&#8208;step synthesis of stereo&#8208;selective methyl&#8208;labeled leucine, which greatly facilitates applications in eucaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems, providing desirable NMR sensors in so far inaccessible protein systems.

Methyl&#8208;based magnetization usage can strongly benefit investigations of large protein systems via NMR spectroscopy. Here, a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to obtain locally deuterated leucine suitable for methyl NMR and to quantify its benefits is presented. The approach substantially expands the applicability of methyl labeling in emerging expression systems including cell&#8208;free and eucaryotic systems.







Abstract
Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective 13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8220;local&#8221; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.

         <title>Tricycloquinazoline&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based 2D conductive MOFs were developed and employed as electrocatalysts for converting CO2 into CH3OH. Cu3(HHTQ)2 with electron&#8208;deficient but nitrogen&#8208;rich TQ cores displays the best electrocatalytic CO2RR performance, showing high selectivity toward CH3OH with Faradic efficiency up to 53.6&#8201;% at a low overpotential of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V and maintained good durability.







Abstract
2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are promising candidates for efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) based multitopic catechol ligand was used to coordinate with transition&#8208;metal ions (Cu2+ and Ni2+), which formed 2D graphene&#8208;like porous sheets: M3(HHTQ)2 (M=Cu, Ni; HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;Hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline). M3(HHTQ)2 can be regarded as a single&#8208;atom catalyst where Cu or Ni centers are uniformly distributed in the hexagonal lattices. Cu3(HHTQ)2 exhibited superior catalytic activity towards CO2RR in which CH3OH is the sole product. The Faradic efficiency of CH3OH reached up to 53.6&#8201;% at a small over&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.4&#8197;V. Cu3(HHTQ)2 exhibited larger CO2 adsorption energies and higher activities over the isostructural Ni3(HHTQ)2 and the reported archetypical Cu3(HHTP)2. There is a strong dependence of both metal centers and the N&#8208;rich ligands on the electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Exceptional electrochemical HER performance with enhanced electron transfer between Ru nanoparticles and single atoms dispersed on carbon substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precisely regulating the electronic structures of metal active species is highly desirable for electrocatalysis. However, carbon with inert surface provide weak metal&#8208;support interaction, which is insufficient to modulate the electronic structures of metal nanoparticles. Herein, we propose a new method to control the electrocatalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles by dispersing single metal atoms on an O&#8208;doped graphene. Ideal atomic metal species are firstly computationally screened. We then verify this concept by deposition of Ru nanoparticles onto an O&#8208;doped graphene decorated with single metal atoms (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consistent with theoretical predictions, such hybrid catalysts show outstanding HER performance, much superior to other reported electrocatalysts such as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C. This work offers a new strategy for modulating the activity and stability of metal nanoparticles for electrocatalysis processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective vibrational strong coupling effects on molecular vibrational relaxation and energy transfer: Numerical insights via cavity molecular dynamics simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For a small fraction of hot CO2 molecules immersed in a liquid&#8208;phase CO2 thermal bath, classical cavity molecular dynamics simulations show that forming collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the C=O asymmetric stretch of&#160;CO2 molecules and a cavity mode accelerates hot&#8208;molecule relaxation. This acceleration stems from the fact that polaritons can be transiently excited during the nonequilibrium process, which facilitates intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. The VSC effects on these rates (i) resonantly depend on the cavity mode detuning, (ii) cooperatively depend on&#160;Rabi splitting, and (iii) collectively scale&#160;with the number of hot molecules. For&#160;larger cavity volumes, the average VSC effect per molecule can remain meaningful for up to N ~ 10^4 molecules forming VSC. Moreover, the transiently excited lower polariton prefers to relax by transferring its energy to the tail of the molecular energy distribution rather than equally distributing it to all thermal molecules. As far as the parameter dependence is concerned, the vibrational relaxation data presented here appears analogous to VSC catalysis in Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Elucidation of Bisdibenzocorannulene at Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Extended&#160;curved polycyclic hydrocarbons have attracted widespread attention in not only chemistry but also materials science. We now report an  anti  &#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (  BDBC  ), featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed a multiple redox active property, and would be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&#960;&#8208;Extended&#160;curved polycyclic hydrocarbons have attracted widespread attention in not only chemistry but also materials science. We now report an  anti  &#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (  BDBC  ), featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed a multiple redox active property, and would be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation.

         <title>Distannylated Monomer of Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8208;Acceptor Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8208;4.4 eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8 S cm  &#8208;1  and power factor of 24.8 &#956;W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;2  . This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane in both solution and the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with the quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 2.02 eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits and specific optoelectronic properties will promote wide applications of the aromatic belt in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkenylative Arylation of Alkenes with Arylboronic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8211;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8211;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8211;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by beta&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazole&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8722;Organic Cages for Efficient C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoreticular functionalization is a well&#8208;elucidated strategy for pore environment tuning and the basis of gas separation performance in extended frameworks. The extension of this approach to discrete porous molecules such as metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is conceptually straightforward but hindered by synthetic complications, especially stability concerns. We report the successful isoreticular functionalization of a zirconium MOC with tetrazole moiety by bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The title compound (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol) shows promising C  2  H  2  /CO  2  and C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  separation performance, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, breakthrough experiments, and density functional theory calculations. The design analogy between MOFs and highly stable MOCs may guide the synthesis of novel porous materials for challenging separation applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of 3D printing fuels the need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction, the borane&#8208;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid&#8208;state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400 Wh kg  &#8722;1  are highly desired for the next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. In this work, we show that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8208;Ah Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  pouch cell demonstrates a practical&#160;specific energy of &gt;450 Wh kg  &#8722;1  . Our findings shed light on reasonable design of electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interface towards practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates:&#160;Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8208;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8208;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Fabrication and Atomic&#8208;scale Characterization of Triply&#8208;linked, Laterally &#960;&#8208;Extended Porphyrin Nanotapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin nanotapes (Por NTs) are highly promising structures for their use as molecular wires thanks to their high degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation, low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps, and exceptional conductance. Such structures have been repeatedly reported in solution&#8208;based approaches, but their on&#8208;surface synthesis, which allows an atomically&#8208;resolved characterization, remains unreported to this date. Here, we report the first example of meso&#8208;meso triply&#8208;fused Por NTs, which are prepared from a readily available Por precursor through a two&#8208;step synthesis on Au(111). The diradical character of the on&#8208;surface formed building block PorA  2  , a phenalenyl &#960;&#8208;extended Zn(II)Por, facilitates intermolecular homocoupling and allows for the formation of laterally &#960;&#8208;extended tapes. The structural and electronic properties of individual Por NTs are addressed, both on Au(111) and on a thin insulating NaCl layer, by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy complemented by density functional theory calculations. Remarkably, the triply&#8208;linked, laterally &#960;&#8208;extended Por NTs carry one unpaired electron at each end, which leads to magnetic end states. Our study provides an alternative and versatile route to the fabrication of Por NTs and the atomic&#8208;scale characterizations of their structural and electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. Here we demonstrate the design of photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. As a result, the octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8208;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest systems and dynamic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Engineering of One&#8208;Dimensional Hollow Nanostructures for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures endow intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we review the recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and boosted electrochemical properties for different kinds of battery applications (i.e., lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes). Based on the insights, we conclude the prospects on critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative works on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications can be stimulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A&#160;Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has accepted broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possess myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. Here we report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. Furthermore, we also revealed the unique anion&#8208;&#960;&#160;interaction of AC3Ts that altered the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the scope and possibilities of GCNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Oligomerization by Silylene&#8208;tethered Sonogashira Coupling on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful methodology for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials. Here, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between trimethylsilyl(TMS)ethynyl and chloropheny groups in silylethynyl&#8208; and chloro&#8208;substituted partially fluorinated phenylene&#8211;ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling achieved a high chemoselectivity up to 75% while the competing homo&#8208;couplings of Ullmann and desilylative Glaser couplings were suppressed. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and density functional theory calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of  intermolecular  silylene&#8208;tethers (&#8208;Me  2  Si&#8208;) via the CH  3  &#8211;Si bond activation at 130 &#176;C and the subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a low thermal conductivity&#160;oxide guided by probe structure&#160;prediction and machine learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the aperiodic titanate Ba  10  Y  6  Ti  4  O  27  with a room temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide.

         <title>Facilitating Ferration of Aromatic Substrates Through Intramolecular Sodium Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting cooperative effects between Na and Fe(II) when present&#160;&#160;in tris(amide) ferrate complexes, the chemoselective ferration of pentafluorobenzene, benzene, toluene, anisole and pyridine has been realised at room temperature. Demonstrating the importance of this bimetallic partnership neither the relevant sodium amide (NaHMDS or NaTMP) or the Fe(II) amide Fe(HMDS)  2  &#160;can efficiently metallate these substrates under the conditions of this study.&#160;&#160;Combining NMR studies with isolation of key intermediates and DFT calculations we offer an account for how these reactions take place, uncovering a surprising reaction pathway in which metals cooperate in a synchronised manner. While isolated products are formally the result of Fe&#8208;H exchange, theoretical calculations indicate that the aromatic substrates undergo Na&#8208;H exchange followed by fast intramolecular transmetallation to Fe, thus stabilizing the newly generated aryl fragment.</dc:description>

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As low temperature conditions (e.g., in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher&#8208;energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example,&#160; we present here the synthesis, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol (  2  ), the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400 &#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10 K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254 nm,&#160;  2&#160;  rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation in order: simple and versatile one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts to encode diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple yet, powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP, sequentially, occur at room temperature by switching the organo&#8208;catalytic conditions from basic to acidic, each allowing the encoding of specific degradable bonds. The ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while the SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;end, enables the formation of acetal bonds and high molar mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion along the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates while being simple, effective, atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208; LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Strained All&#8208;Phenylene Siamese&#8208;Twin Bismacrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed&#160;Siamese&#8208;twin&#160;(1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twist benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The Siamese&#8208;twin structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59 kcal/mol and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge generation and separation have been regarded as the main constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein  , two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8208;CPs) with different linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs have been tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influences of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results unravel that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linking pattern, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern theoretically  helps to strengthen donor&#8208;acceptor interaction of PAE&#8208;CPs and generate the coplanar structure to facilitate the charge generation and separation, as well as red&#8208;shift light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8208;D with double&#8208;stranded linking pattern assumes a greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity than the single&#8208;stranded linking pattern analogue (PAE&#8208;S), facilitating the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (  E  b  ) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small  E  b  of &#8208;0.11~0.15 eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak  E  b  in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Classical amination methods involve the reaction of a nitrogen nucleophile with an electrophilic carbon center; however, in recent years, umpoled strategies have gained traction, where the nitrogen source acts as an electrophile. A wide range of electrophilic aminating agents are now available, and these underpin a range of powerful C&#8208;N bond forming processes. In this review, we highlight the strategic use of electrophilic aminating agents in total synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarker in vivo and in situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward HCC&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in vivo and in situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. In vivo signals of probe correlating well with tumor apoptosis make it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. Excellent property of probe enables the first imaging of CE activity in situ with high resolution three&#8208;dimensional view. This study may promote advancements in optical imaging approach for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in situ and its evaluation of treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Stacked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dendrimers for Highly Efficient White Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton. The dendritic structure and orthogonal configuration of teracridan not only make their outer acridan segments approaching to acceptor in close distance, but also fix donor and acceptor in face&#8208;to&#8208;face alignment, leading to through&#8208;space charge transfer emission with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) effect. By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region. Solution&#8208;processed two&#8208;color white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on blue and yellow &#960;&#8208;stacked donor&#8208;acceptor dendrimers exhibit the maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6% and maximum power efficiency of 58.9 lm W  &#8208;1  , representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency for all&#8208;TADF white OLEDs by solution process.</dc:description>

         <title>General Synthesis of Ordered Mesoporous Carbonaceous Hybrid Nanostructures with Molecularly Dispersed Polyoxometallates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100 %) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning&#160;of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of multi&#8208;chiral helicates with self&#8208;amplifying enantioselectivity. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded Zn  II  2  L  3  complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and Zn(II). Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted multi&#8208;chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global multi&#8208;chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates their chiral discriminations are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.</dc:description>

         <title>Low dimensional inorganic tin perovskite solar cells by a template growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x  with mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. Kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2  and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x. The film shows out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability and oxidation resistance. Solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8208;x  perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air. Low&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure provides a route for the development of high efficiency and stable tin halide perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress due to the recent advances of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached over 14%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still severely restricted by the lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption spectrum, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. Herein, a multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, namely PFY&#8208;3Se, based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer was designed and developed. Compared to its thiophene analog PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se possesses a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption (~30 nm), increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular aggregation and packing. When matched with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6 mA cm&#8208;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs field reported so far and much better than those of thiophene analogs (PCE=13.0%). More importantly, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties which is very helpful for realizing reproducible device performance. This is the first reported and also is very rare for the PSMAs so far which provides a potential candidate for efficient all&#8208;PSCs toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tricyanidoferrates(&#8211;IV) and Ruthenates(&#8211;IV) with Non&#8208;Innocent Cyanido&#160;Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, nearly trigonal&#8208;planar tricyanidometalate anions [Fe(CN)3]7&#8211;  and [Ru(CN)3]7&#8211;  were stabilized in LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] and  Ae3.5M(CN)3] (Ae  = Sr, Ba;  M  = Fe, Ru). They are the first examples of group 8 elements with the oxidation state of &#8211;IV. Microcrystalline powders were obtained by a solid&#8208;state route, single&#8208;crystals from alkali metal flux. While LiSr3[Fe(CN)3] crystallizes in  P  63/m  , the polar space group  P  63  with three&#8208;fold cell volume for  Ae3.5[M(CN)3] is confirmed by second harmonic generation. X&#8208;ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy reveal longer C&#8211;N distances (124&#8211;128 pm) and much lower stretching frequencies (1484&#8211;1634 cm&#8211;1  ) than in classical cyanidometalates. Weak C&#8211;N bonds in combination with strong  M  &#8211;C &#960;&#8208;bonding is a scheme also known for carbonylmetalates. Instead of the formal notation [Fe&#8211;IV(CN&#8211;)3]7&#8211;, quantum chemical calculations revealed non&#8208;innocent intermediate&#8208;valent CN1.67&#8211;  ligands and a closed&#8208;shell d10  configuration for Fe, i.e. Fe2&#8211;  .</dc:description>

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500 cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8 V at 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10oC. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A modular in vitro platform for the production of terpenes and polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO  2  as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharma&#173;ceuticals, fragrances and food&#8208;additives. Here we developed a modular  in vitro  platform for the continuous conversion of CO  2  into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO  2  into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simul&#173;taneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29 enzymes in one pot, which opens the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO  2  &#8208;based chemicals in the future.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing waves measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature programmed desorption the binding strength. Density functional theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyze a vast variety of reactions rendering the regulation of their activity a key method to control biological function. In this work, we report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis. Firstly, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin inhibiting its catalytic activity. With both ultrasound generating inertial cavitation (20 kHz) and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound (5 MHz), the specific interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved restoring the activity of thrombin to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Secondly, we expanded this approach to split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. Notably, the latter process is reversible and can be induced multiple times without apparent fatigue. We envision that this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach to regulate the activity of aptamer&#8208;guarded enzymes by ultrasound will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli and open further avenues in sonogenetics.</dc:description>
