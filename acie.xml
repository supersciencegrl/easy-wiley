         <title>Helicity&#8208; and Molecular&#8208;Weight&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Sorting and Assembly of Helical Polymers towards Two&#8208;Dimensional Smectic Architectures and Selectively Adhesive Gels</title>

Single&#8208;handed helical polymers can recognize themselves by discrimination of their helicity and molecular weight, and further self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional smectic architectures. Moreover, gels formed from the helical polymers can also recognize themselves based on helicity and molecular weight and can selectively adhere together to form one gel.







Abstract
Self&#8208;sorting plays a crucial role in living systems such as the selective assembly of DNA and specific folding of proteins. However, the self&#8208;sorting of artificial helical polymers such as biomacromolecules has rarely been achieved. In this work, single&#8208;handed helical poly(phenyl isocyanide)s bearing pyrene (Py) and naphthalene (Np) probes were prepared, which exhibited interesting self&#8208;sorting properties driven by both helicity and molecular weight (Mn) in solution, solid state, gel, and on the gel surface as well. The polymers with the same helix sense and similar Mn can self&#8208;sort and assemble into well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional smectic architectures and form stable gels in organic solvents. In contrast, mixed polymers with opposite handedness or different Mn were repulsive to each other and did not aggregate. Moreover, the gels of helical polymers with the same handedness and similar Mn can recognize themselves and adhere together to form a gel.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Volume Phase Transition of Polyacid Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7117-7125, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving past classical passive responsive behavior, transient volume phase transitions of poly(methacrylic acid) microgels can be achieved through the use of a chemical fuel. The deswelling creates a transient hydrophobic environment with a lifetime tunable via pH and fuel concentration with possible applications for encapsulation/release.







Abstract
Microgels are soft colloids that show responsive behavior and are easy to functionalize for applications. They are considered key components for future smart colloidal material systems. However, so far microgel systems have almost exclusively been studied in classical responsive switching settings using external triggers, while internally organized, autonomous control mechanisms as found in supramolecular chemistry and DNA nanotechnology relying on fuel&#8208;driven out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium concepts have not been implemented into microgel systems. Here, we introduce chemically fueled transient volume phase transitions (VPTs) for poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) microgels, where the collapsed hydrophobic state can be programmed using the fuel concentration in a cyclic reaction network. We discuss details of the system behavior as a function of pH and fuel amount, unravel kinetically trapped regions and showcase transient encapsulation and time&#8208;programmed release as a first application.

         <title>Anodic Oxidation Enabled Cation Leaching for Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7418-7425, March 22, 2021. </description>

CoCr2O4 activated at 1.7&#8197;V for 1.5&#8197;h (Act&#8208;CoCr2O4) exhibits better OER activity compared to IrO2 in alkaline solutions. Pristine CoCr2O4 is originally inactive; activation (&gt;1.56&#8197;V) promotes Cr leaching and lattice oxygen losses in CoCr2O4, leaving the highly defective surface for Co species to reconstruct into octahedrally coordinated Co3+&#8211;4+ oxyhydroxide.







Abstract
A rational design for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Much work has been devoted to understanding cation leaching and surface reconstruction of very active electrocatalysts, but little on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion. We now report controllable anodic leaching of Cr in CoCr2O4 by activating the pristine material at high potential, which enables the transformation of inactive spinel CoCr2O4 into a highly active catalyst. The depletion of Cr and consumption of lattice oxygen facilitate surface defects and oxygen vacancies, exposing Co species to reconstruct into active Co oxyhydroxides differ from CoOOH. A novel mechanism with the evolution of tetrahedrally coordinated surface cation into octahedral configuration via non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer is proposed. This work shows the importance of controlled anodic potential in modifying the surface chemistry of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Live&#8208;Cell Delivery of Synthetic Proteins Assisted by Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Fused to DABCYL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7333-7343, March 22, 2021. </description>

Efficient intracellular delivery of synthetic native proteins is a challenge due to endosomal entrapment and subsequent degradation. We report the enhanced cellular uptake of fluorescently labelled synthetic proteins by attaching a newly developed cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) composed of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine linked to DABCYL.







Abstract
Live&#8208;cell delivery of a fully synthetic protein having selectivity towards a particular target is a promising approach with potential applications for basic research and therapeutics. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) allow the cellular delivery of proteins but mostly result in endosomal entrapment, leading to lack of bioavailability. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a CPP fused to 4&#8208;((4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) to enhance cellular uptake of fluorescently labelled synthetic protein analogues in low micromolar concentration. The attachment of cyclic deca&#8208;arginine (cR10) modified with a single lysine linked to DABCYL to synthetic ubiquitin (Ub) and small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifier&#8208;2 (SUMO&#8208;2) scaffolds resulted in a threefold higher uptake efficacy in live cells compared to the unmodified cR10. We could also achieve cR10DABCYL&#8208;assisted delivery of Ub and a Ub variant (Ubv) based activity&#8208;based probes for functional studies of deubiquitinases in live cells.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution on Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Lead Iodide Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7376-7381, March 22, 2021. </description>

Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites perform photocatalytic H2 production more efficiently than their 3D counterparts in spite of the higher exciton binding energy and inferior light absorption. The length of the organic cations of 2D perovskites influences the optoelectronic and charge transfer properties, and the perovskite with the shortest organic cation length achieved the benchmark solar energy conversion efficiency.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated excellent capability in solar fuel production, while the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) counterparts are generally considered inferior candidates due to the high exciton binding energy and weak light absorption. Herein, contrary to our common understanding, we find that 2D perovskites can perform photocatalytic H2 production from HI splitting more efficiently than their 3D counterparts. We observed sharp difference between 2D perovskites crystals with organic phenylalkylammonium cations of different lengths and the 3D counterparts in their stabilization behavior in aqueous solution. Moreover, we show that the organic cations length of the 2D perovskites affects the nanostructures, optoelectronic properties, and the charge transfer process significantly, which determines the photocatalytic activity of the 2D perovskites. Among the 2D perovskites under investigation, phenylmethylammonium lead iodide with the shortest organic cations achieved the best solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of ca. 1.57&#8201;%, which is the highest value ever reported for hybrid perovskites.

&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites perform photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production more efficiently than their 3D counterparts in spite of the higher exciton binding energy and inferior light absorption. The length of the organic cations of 2D perovskites influences the optoelectronic and charge transfer properties, and the perovskite with the shortest organic cation length achieved the benchmark solar energy conversion efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have demonstrated excellent capability in solar fuel production, while the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) counterparts are generally considered inferior candidates due to the high exciton binding energy and weak light absorption. Herein, contrary to our common understanding, we find that 2D perovskites can perform photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from HI splitting more efficiently than their 3D counterparts. We observed sharp difference between 2D perovskites crystals with organic phenylalkylammonium cations of different lengths and the 3D counterparts in their stabilization behavior in aqueous solution. Moreover, we show that the organic cations length of the 2D perovskites affects the nanostructures, optoelectronic properties, and the charge transfer process significantly, which determines the photocatalytic activity of the 2D perovskites. Among the 2D perovskites under investigation, phenylmethylammonium lead iodide with the shortest organic cations achieved the best solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of ca. 1.57&#8201;%, which is the highest value ever reported for hybrid perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Impact of Organic Templates on the Selective Formation of Zeolite Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7111-7116, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and kMC calculations are combined to investigate the impact of the most commonly used organic template molecules including the tetramethylamine cation (TMA+) both on the reaction energy profiles and the kinetics of formation of zeolite silica oligomers. The extended reaction path mechanism includes up to 258 equilibrium reactions. The templating agent is shown to produce higher concentration of 4&#8208;membered ring intermediates.







Abstract
Zeolites are essential materials to industry due to their adsorption and catalytic properties. The best current approach to prepare a targeted zeolite still relies on trial and error's synthetic procedures since a rational understanding of the impact of synthesis variables on the final structures is still missing. To discern the role of a variety of organic templates, we perform simulations of the early stages of condensation of silica oligomers by combining DFT, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Evans&#8208;Polanyi relationships and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We investigate an extended reaction path mechanism including 258&#8197;equilibrium reactions and 242&#8197;chemical species up to silica octamers, comparing the computed concentrations of Si oligomers with 29SI NMR experimental data. The effect of the templating agent is linked to the modification of the intramolecular H&#8208;bond network in the growing oligomer, which produces higher concentration of 4&#8208;membered ring intermediates, precursors of the key double&#8208;four ring building blocks present on more than 39 known zeolite topologies.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenation Through an Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7290-7296, March 22, 2021. </description>

An approach to the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes and heterocycles uses Ru and redox&#8208;active ligands. A wide range of functionalized substrates afforded dehydrogenated products in good yields. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a redox&#8208;active ligand&#8208;assisted intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer is crucial to this process.







Abstract
The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes is among the most efficient ways to access valuable alkene products. Although several catalysts have been designed to promote this transformation, they have unfortunately found limited applications in fine chemical synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel strategy for the catalytic, intermolecular dehydrogenation of alkanes using a ruthenium catalyst. The combination of a redox&#8208;active ligand and a sterically hindered aryl radical intermediate has unleashed this novel strategy. Importantly, mechanistic investigations have been performed to provide a conceptual framework for the further development of this new catalytic dehydrogenation system.

         <title>Molecular Simulations suggest Vitamins, Retinoids and Steroids as Ligands of the Free Fatty Acid Pocket of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein**

Vitamin&#8197;K2 docked at the fatty acid site in the closed SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. Simulations indicate that ligands binding at this site stabilize the closed spike conformation.







Abstract
We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor&#8208;binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA&#8208;approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitamin&#8197;D); retinoids (some known to be active in vitro, and vitamin&#8197;A); and vitamin&#8197;K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.

         <title>A Broad&#8208;Spectrum Catalytic Amidation of Sulfonyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfates**

1&#8208;Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) was identified as an efficient nucleophilic catalyst to activate sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates for a broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic amidation to prepare various sulfonamides and sulfamates, including sterically hindered ones. The potential of this methodology in medicinal and process chemistry has been demonstrated by multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative and synthesis of the drug Fedratinib.







Abstract
A broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic method has been developed for the synthesis of sulfonamides and sulfamates. With the activation by the combination of a catalytic amount of 1&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and silicon additives, amidations of sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates proceeded smoothly and excellent yields were generally obtained (87&#8211;99&#8201;%). Noticeably, this protocol is particularly efficient for sterically hindered substrates. Catalyst loading is generally low and only 0.02&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst is required for the multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative. In addition, the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry has been demonstrated by the synthesis of the marketed drug Fedratinib via a key intermediate sulfonyl fluoride 13. Since a large number of amines are commercially available, this route provides a facile entry to access Fedratinib analogues for biological screening.

         <title>Unveiling Intrinsic Potassium Storage Behaviors of Hierarchical Nano Bi@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocages Framework via In Situ Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7180-7187, March 22, 2021. </description>

A hierarchical nano Bi@N&#8208;doped carbon nanocage framework with an interior void space was smartly fabricated as competitive anode for K&#8208;ion batteries. Its intrinsic potassium storage behaviors are unveiled via comprehensive in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Metallic bismuth has drawn attention as a promising alloying anode for advanced potassium ion batteries (PIBs). However, serious volume expansion/electrode pulverization and sluggish kinetics always lead to its inferior cycling and rate properties for practical applications. Therefore, advanced Bi&#8208;based anodes via structural/compositional optimization and sur&#8208;/interface design are needed.

&lt;p&gt;A hierarchical nano Bi@N&#8208;doped carbon nanocage framework with an interior void space was smartly fabricated as competitive anode for K&#8208;ion batteries. Its intrinsic potassium storage behaviors are unveiled via comprehensive in situ characterizations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallic bismuth has drawn attention as a promising alloying anode for advanced potassium ion batteries (PIBs). However, serious volume expansion/electrode pulverization and sluggish kinetics always lead to its inferior cycling and rate properties for practical applications. Therefore, advanced Bi&#8208;based anodes via structural/compositional optimization and sur&#8208;/interface design are needed. Herein, we develop a bottom&#8208;up avenue to fabricate nanoscale Bi encapsulated in a 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (Bi@N&#8208;CNCs) framework with a void space by using a novel Bi&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework as the precursor. With elaborate regulation in annealing temperatures, the optimized Bi@N&#8208;CNCs electrode exhibits large reversible capacities and long&#8208;duration cyclic stability at high rates when evaluated as competitive anodes for PIBs. Insights into the intrinsic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;storage processes of the Bi@N&#8208;CNCs anode are put forward from comprehensive in situ characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss Achieved by a Pyridine&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7227-7233, March 22, 2021. </description>

A new pyridine&#8208;based polymer semiconductor (PPY2) was introduced as the dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting material in inverted perovskite solar cells. It exhibits suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, effective passivation effects, and the capability of promoting the formation of a high&#8208;quality polycrystalline perovskite film. The devices based on PPY2 delivered an encouraging power&#8208;conversion efficiency up to 22.41&#8201;% with a high VOC of 1.16&#8197;V.







Abstract
Currently, the performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (VOC) loss caused by detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein, we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes inside perovskites and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), PPY2, which exhibits suitable energy levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of high&#8208;quality polycrystalline perovskite films. In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using PPY2 as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41&#8201;% with a small VOC loss (0.40&#8197;V), among the best device performances for inverted PVSCs reported so far. Furthermore, PPY2&#8208;based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long&#8208;term photostability, and over 97&#8201;% of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun constant illumination for 500&#8197;h.

         <title>A Physical Entangling Strategy for Simultaneous Interior and Exterior Modification of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7389-7396, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the conventional approach where polymer brushes were covalently grafted on the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ligand, our approach involves grafting polyimide brushes to the polymer chains physically entangled with the framework through in&#8197;situ polymerization. This allows the decoration of non&#8208;functionalized MOF surfaces with polyimides for improved dispersibility in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes.







Abstract
A new strategy uses a common feature of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely porosity rather than functionality, to achieve simultaneous interior and exterior modification of a MOF with polymers. We demonstrate that an anhydride&#8208;terminated polyimide oligomer can be covalently grafted to the amine&#8208;functionalized methacrylate polymer backbone residing underneath the MOF surface and physically entangled within the 3D nanochannels. The MOF particles were evenly coated with a thin layer of polyimide brushes on the surface thereby exhibiting increased dispersibility in solvent media as well as in polymer matrix. The MOF pores were decorated with aliphatic amine groups to endow the MOF with higher CO2 affinity at low pressure. The polyimide&#8208;grafted surface allowed MOF particles to interact favorably with the polyimide matrix, producing defect&#8208;free MMM with drastically improved CO2 permeability and maintaining the inherent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of the neat polymeric membrane.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;Crosslinked Porous Polymeric Networks for the Removal of Micropollutants from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7188-7196, March 22, 2021. </description>

Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers have been prepared for water purification. The structure of the polymer P1 could be easily modified to yield the anionic polymer P3, which showed particularly effective adsorption for cationic micropollutants. Theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of 454&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the dye methylene blue, 344&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for diquat were determined for P3.







Abstract
Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P1&#8211;P3) for removing organic micropollutants from water were prepared. A bowl&#8208;shaped &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a 3D network polymer, P1. P1 proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent and was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative P3 (containing carboxylate anion groups). Anionic P3 outperformed P2 in screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality. P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity (qmax,e) of P3 reached 454&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the dye methylene blue, 344&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for diquat. These uptake values are significantly higher than those of most synthetic adsorbent materials reported to date.

         <title>Broadening the Horizon of the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi Principle towards Optically Triggered Structure Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7205-7212, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi principle was used to probe photoinduced structure planarization of a series of dibenz[b,f]azepine (DBA) derivatives incorporating bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar and rotation motion. A saddle point was calculated for all PDBAs along the structural transition pathway. A relationship was elucidated between kinetics and thermodynamics, providing insight into the ratiometric luminescence properties of excited&#8208;state structural transformations.







Abstract
Finding a relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics may be difficult. However, semi&#8208;empirical rules exist to compensate for this shortcoming, among which the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi (B&#8208;E&#8208;P) principle is an example for reactions involving bond breakage and reformation. We expand the B&#8208;E&#8208;P principle to a new territory by probing photoinduced structure planarization (PISP) of a series of dibenz[b,f]azepine derivatives incorporating bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar and rotation motion. The latter involves twisting of the partial double bond character, thereby inducing a barrier that is substituent dependent at the para N&#8208;phenyl position. The transition&#8208;state structure and frequency data satisfy and broaden the B&#8208;E&#8208;P principle to PISP reactions without bond rearrangement. Together with dual emissions during PISP, this makes possible harnessing of the kinetics/thermodynamics relationship and hence ratiometric luminescence properties for excited&#8208;state structural transformations.

A saddle point was calculated for all &lt;b&gt;PDBAs&lt;/b&gt; along the structural transition pathway. A relationship was elucidated between kinetics and thermodynamics, providing insight into the ratiometric luminescence properties of excited&#8208;state structural transformations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics may be difficult. However, semi&#8208;empirical rules exist to compensate for this shortcoming, among which the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;B&#8208;E&#8208;P&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) principle is an example for reactions involving bond breakage and reformation. We expand the &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;B&#8208;E&#8208;P&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; principle to a new territory by probing photoinduced structure planarization (PISP) of a series of dibenz[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]azepine derivatives incorporating bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar and rotation motion. The latter involves twisting of the partial double bond character, thereby inducing a barrier that is substituent dependent at the &lt;i&gt;para N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenyl position. The transition&#8208;state structure and frequency data satisfy and broaden the &lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;B&#8208;E&#8208;P&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; principle to PISP reactions without bond rearrangement. Together with dual emissions during PISP, this makes possible harnessing of the kinetics/thermodynamics relationship and hence ratiometric luminescence properties for excited&#8208;state structural transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electrochemical Arylation of Aldehydes, Ketones, and Alcohols: from Cathodic Reduction to Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7275-7282, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical approaches to the direct arylation of carbonyls and alcohols through less&#8208;explored cathodic reduction and convergent paired electrolysis are presented. This protocol features: excellent functional group (including ester, amide, amine, thioether, borate) tolerance, mild conditions (metal catalyst&#8208; and external reductant&#8208;free), good scalability (&gt;10&#8197;gram&#8208;scale), and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Arylation of carbonyls, one of the most common approaches toward alcohols, has received tremendous attention, as alcohols are important feedstocks and building blocks in organic synthesis. Despite great progress, there is still a great gap to develop an ideal arylation method featuring mild conditions, good functional group tolerance, and readily available starting materials. We now show that electrochemical arylation can fill the gap. By taking advantage of synthetic electrochemistry, commercially available aldehydes (ketones) and benzylic alcohols can be readily arylated to provide a general and scalable access to structurally diverse alcohols (97 examples, &gt;10&#8197;gram&#8208;scale). More importantly, convergent paired electrolysis, the ideal but challenging electrochemical technology, was employed to transform low&#8208;value alcohols into more useful alcohols. Detailed mechanism study suggests that two plausible pathways are involved in the redox neutral &#945;&#8208;arylation of benzylic alcohols.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Protected Metal Halide Perovskite Nanosheets with an Enhanced Set of Stabilities</title>

A multidentate ligand synthetic strategy based on a linear amphiphilic PMMA&#8208;b&#8208;PAA diblock copolymer prepared from RAFT polymerization enables the synthesis of PMMA&#8208;tethered CsPbBr3/TiO2 core/shell nanosheets (NSs). These NSs have markedly enhanced stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.), and thus potential applications in optoelectronic materials and devices.







Abstract
Approaches to achieve stable perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) of interest, in particular those with large structural anisotropy, through protective coating of the inorganic shell at a single&#8208;nanocrystal (NC) level are comparatively few and limited in scope. Reported here is a robust amphiphilic&#8208;diblock&#8208;copolymer&#8208;enabled strategy for crafting highly&#8208;stable anisotropic CsPbBr3 nanosheets (NSs) by in situ formation of a uniform inorganic shell (1st shielding) that is intimately ligated with hydrophobic polymers (2nd shielding). The dual&#8208;protected NSs display an array of remarkable stabilities (i.e., thermal, photostability, moisture, polar solvent, aliphatic amine, etc.) and find application in white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes. In principle, by anchoring other multidentate amphiphilic polymer ligands on the surface of PNCs, followed by templated&#8208;growth of shell materials of interest, a rich variety of dual&#8208;shelled, multifunctional PNCs with markedly improved stabilities can be created for use in optics, optoelectronics, and sensory devices.

         <title>CeIV70 Oxosulfate Rings, Frameworks, Supramolecular Assembly, and Redox Activity**

The Ce70&#8208;sulfate wheel assembles from water into intricate frameworks with transition metal countercations. Dissolved in organic media, Ce70 exhibits very different supramolecular assembly. These frameworks demonstrate redox activity, owed to mixed CeIII/IV linking monomers.







Abstract
MIV molecular oxo&#8208;clusters (M=Zr, Hf, Ce, Th, U, Np, Pu) are prolific in bottoms&#8208;up material design, catalysis, and elucidating reaction pathways in nature and in synthesis. Here we introduce Ce70, a wheel&#8208;shaped oxo&#8208;cluster, [CeIV70(OH)36(O)64(SO4)60(H2O)10]4&#8722;. Ce70 crystallizes into intricate high pore volume frameworks with divalent transition metals and Ce&#8208;monomer linkers. Eight crystal&#8208;structures feature four framework types in which the Ce70&#8208;rings are linked as propellers, in offset&#8208;stacks, in a tartan pattern, and as isolated rings. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering of Ce70 dissolved in butylamine, with and without added cations (CeIV, alkaline earths, MnII), shows the metals&#8216; differentiating roles in ring linking, leading to supramolecular assemblies. The large acidic pores and abundant terminal sulfates provide ion&#8208;exchange behavior, demonstrated with UIV and NdIII. Frameworks featuring CeIII/IV&#8208;monomer linkers demonstrate both oxidation and reduction. This study opens the door to mixed&#8208;metal, highly porous framework catalysts, and new clusters for metal&#8208;organic framework design

         <title>Unconventional Photocatalysis in Conductive Polymers: Reversible Modulation of PEDOT:PSS Conductivity by Long&#8208;Lived Poly(Heptazine Imide) Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7436-7443, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive polymer (PEDOT:PSS) and potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI) are combined in one hybrid nanocomposite as electron donor and photocatalyst, respectively. The composite represents an example of unconventional photocatalysis: K&#8208;PHI modulates the physicochemical properties of the conductive polymer upon exposure to light and dark in different environments.







Abstract
In photocatalysis, small organic molecules are converted into desired products using light responsive materials, electromagnetic radiation, and electron mediators. Substitution of low molecular weight reagents with redox active functional materials may increase the utility of photocatalysis beyond organic synthesis and environmental applications. Guided by the general principles of photocatalysis, we design hybrid nanocomposites composed of n&#8208;type semiconducting potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K&#8208;PHI), and p&#8208;type conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the redox active substrate. Electrical conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite, possessing optimal K&#8208;PHI content, is reversibly modulated combining a series of external stimuli ranging from visible light under inert conditions and to dark conditions under an O2 atmosphere. Using a conductive polymer as the redox active substrate allows study of the photocatalytic processes mediated by semiconducting photocatalysts through electrical conductivity measurements.

Based on a &#8220;TADF&#8211;Linker&#8211;Host&#8221; strategy, a series of polyimide (PI)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers with excellent thermal stability (Tg&gt;308.7&#8201;&#176;C, Td&gt;519.5&#8201;&#176;C) and refractive index (1.76&#8211;1.79) are reported. Through device optimization, a current efficiency of 60.2&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 was realized.







Abstract
A series of rigid nonconjugated polyimide (PI)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers were reported for the first time, based on a &#8220;TADF&#8208;Linker&#8208;Host&#8221; strategy. Among of which, the TADF unit contains a typical TADF luminous core structure, the &#8220;Host&#8221; unit exhibits effective conjugation length that endows polyimide with high triplet energy, and the &#8220;Linker&#8221; unit has an aliphatic ring structure to improve solubility and inhibits intramolecular charge transfer effect. All the TADF polymers exhibit high thermal stability (Tg&gt;308.7&#8201;&#176;C) and refractive index (1.76&#8211;1.79). Remarkably, highly&#8208;efficient polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on the polymers are successfully realized, leading to a maximal external quantum efficiency of 21.0&#8201;% along with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Such outstanding efficiency is amongst the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of nonconjugated PLEDs, confirming the effectiveness of structural design strategy, providing helpful and valuable guidance on the development of highly&#8208;efficient fluorescent polymer materials and PLEDs.

         <title>Tuning the H&#8208;Atom Transfer Reactivity of Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo Complexes as Probed by Infrared Photodissociation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7126-7131, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics of H&#8208;atom transfer mediated by iron(IV)oxo complexes with different cis&#8208;ligands can be studied in a modular flow reactor coupled to MS detection. The HAT reactivity correlates with the intrinsic properties of the isolated complexes in the gas phase. A ligand with a larger binding energy forms a more reactive complex for the HAT reactions, has a weaker FeIV=O bond, and forms a stronger FeIIIO&#8722;H bond after the HAT reaction.







Abstract
Reactivities of non&#8208;heme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complexes are mostly controlled by the ligands. Complexes with tetradentate ligands such as [(TPA)FeO]2+ (TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) belong to the most reactive ones. Here, we show a fine&#8208;tuning of the reactivity of [(TPA)FeO]2+ by an additional ligand X (X=CH3CN, CF3SO3&#8722;, ArI, and ArIO; ArI=2&#8208;(tBuSO2)C6H4I) attached in solution and reveal a thus far unknown role of the ArIO oxidant. The HAT reactivity of [(TPA)FeO(X)]+/2+ decreases in the order of X: ArIO &gt; MeCN &gt; ArI &#8776; TfO&#8722;. Hence, ArIO is not just a mere oxidant of the iron(II) complex, but it can also increase the reactivity of the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex as a labile ligand. The detected HAT reactivities of the [(TPA)FeO(X)]+/2+ complexes correlate with the Fe=O and FeO&#8722;H stretching vibrations of the reactants and the respective products as determined by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. Hence, the most reactive [(TPA)FeO(ArIO)]2+ adduct in the series has the weakest Fe=O bond and forms the strongest FeO&#8722;H bond in the HAT reaction.

         <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for &#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7155-7164, March 22, 2021. </description>

2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) obtained by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy could serve as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT). In addition, SnNSs could serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy (PTT) and &#946;&#8208;elemene delivery. This study not only presents a robust strategy for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri&#8208;modal combination cancer therapy.







Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non&#8208;invasiveness and high tissue&#8208;penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3&#8197;eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano&#8208;sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US&#8208;triggered separation of electron (e&#8722;)&#8208;hole (h+) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT&#8208;enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.

         <title>In situ Construction of Robust Biphasic Surface Layers on Lithium Metal for Lithium&#8211;Sulfide Batteries with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7267-7274, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of robust biphasic surface layers is described through a facile solution pretreatment method with highly polar dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. The method improves the cyclic stability of the lithium electrode significantly and thereby the stability of lithium&#8211;sulfide batteries that contain the electrode.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have potential in high energy density battery systems. However, intermediates of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can easily shuttle to the Li anode and react with Li metal to deplete the active materials and cause rapid failure of the battery. A facile solution pretreatment method for Li anodes involving a solution of metal fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide was developed to construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs) in&#8197;situ. The BSLs consist of lithiophilic alloy (LixM) and LiF phases on Li metal, which inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li&#8208;S batteries. The BSLs allow Li+ transport and they inhibit dendrite growth and shield the Li anodes from corrosive reaction with LiPSs. Li&#8208;S batteries containing BSLs&#8208;Li anodes demonstrate excellent cycling over 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2&#8201;%. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, we propose a strategy for inhibition of the shuttle effect that produces high stability Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Practical and Selective sp3 C&#8722;H Bond Chlorination via Aminium Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7132-7139, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct and selective sp3 C&#8722;H chlorination has been achieved using a photoinduced strategy. This approach is based on a radical&#8208;chain propagation that exploits the ability of aminium radicals to undergo site&#8208;selective H&#8208;atom transfer (HAT).







Abstract
The introduction of chlorine atoms into organic molecules is fundamental to the manufacture of industrial chemicals, the elaboration of advanced synthetic intermediates and also the fine&#8208;tuning of physicochemical and biological properties of drugs, agrochemicals and polymers. We report here a general and practical photochemical strategy enabling the site&#8208;selective chlorination of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds. This process exploits the ability of protonated N&#8208;chloroamines to serve as aminium radical precursors and also radical chlorinating agents. Upon photochemical initiation, an efficient radical&#8208;chain propagation is established allowing the functionalization of a broad range of substrates due to the large number of compatible functionalities. The ability to synergistically maximize both polar and steric effects in the H&#8208;atom transfer transition state through appropriate selection of the aminium radical has provided the highest known selectivity in radical sp3 C&#8722;H chlorination.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Heteroarenyne Cycloisomerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7412-7417, March 22, 2021. </description>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ene&#8208;type cycloisomerization of heteroarenynes has been developed with alkyne&#8208;tethered indoles as substrates. The reaction provides an efficient avenue for the synthesis of structurally diverse indolines bearing quaternary stereocenters in moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The extensively developed ene&#8208;type enantioselective cycloisomerization of classical 1,n&#8208;enynes provides an efficient approach to chiral cyclic 1,4&#8208;dienes. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric heteroarenyne (heteroarene&#8211;alkyne) cycloisomerization involving the dearomative transformation of endocyclic aromatic C=C bonds remains unknown. Herein, we communicate a PdH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective heteroarenyne cycloisomerization reaction of alkyne&#8208;tethered indole substrates (formal 1,5&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;enynes). Based on this strategy, a variety of structurally diverse chiral spiro and fused indoline derivatives bearing quaternary stereocenters and exocyclic C=C bonds are afforded in moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). The classical ene&#8208;type enantioselective 1,5&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization of N&#8208;vinylpropiolamides is also developed to afford chiral 2&#8208;pyrrolones in good to excellent ee values.

         <title>Anion Texturing Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7213-7219, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion texturing approach is developed to achieve an (002) textured Zn with exposed in&#8208;plane orientated basal planes, where the role of anion interaction is explored. Benchmarking against its conventional (101) textured counterpart, Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free stripping/plating at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The reversibility of metal anode is a fundamental challenge to the lifetime of rechargeable batteries. Though being widely employed in aqueous energy storage systems, metallic zinc suffers from dendrite formation that severely hinders its applications. Here we report texturing Zn as an effective way to address the issue of zinc dendrite. An in&#8208;plane oriented Zn texture with preferentially exposed (002) basal plane is demonstrated via a sulfonate anion&#8208;induced electrodeposition, noting no solid report on (002) textured Zn till now. Anion&#8208;induced reconstruction of zinc coordination is revealed to be responsible for the texture formation. Benchmarking against its (101) textured&#8208;counterpart by the conventional sulphate&#8208;based electrolyte, the Zn (002) texture enables highly reversible stripping/plating at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, showing its dendrite&#8208;free characteristics. The Zn (002) texture&#8208;based aqueous zinc battery exhibits excellent cycling stability. The developed anion texturing approach provides a pathway towards exploring zinc chemistry and prospering aqueous rechargeable batteries.

A SO2 surrogate (SOgen) is reported, which is cheap, bench&#8208;stable, and accessible in just two steps from bulk chemicals. SOgen releases SO2 in just a few minutes when heated in the presence of a styrene. The compatibility of this gas&#8208;releasing method with eight previously reported sulfonylation reactions was demonstrated in a two&#8208;chamber system. Direct aminosulfonylation between aryl iodides and amines is reported.







Abstract
A new SO2 surrogate is reported that is cheap, bench&#8208;stable, and can be accessed in just two steps from bulk chemicals. Essentially complete SO2 release is achieved in 5&#8197;minutes. Eight established sulfonylation reactions proceeded smoothly by ex&#8197;situ formation of SO2 by utilizing a two&#8208;chamber system in combination with the SO2 surrogate. Furthermore, we report the first direct aminosulfonylation between aryl iodides and amines. Broad functional group tolerance is demonstrated, and the method is applicable to pharmaceutically relevant substrates, including heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Boosting Zinc Electrode Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes by Using Low&#8208;Cost Antisolvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7366-7375, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water activity and Zn2+ solvation in an ZnSO4 electrolyte are regulated by adding methanol as antisolvent. Methanol gradually interacts with the free and coordinated water in the Zn2+ solvation sheath in the electrolyte, to suppress side reactions and enhance the Zn2+ transference number. Concomitantly, Zn2+ deposition orientation is changed, resulting in dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and boosted Zn reversibility.







Abstract
Antisolvent addition has been widely studied in crystallization in the pharmaceutical industries by breaking the solvation balance of the original solution. Here we report a similar antisolvent strategy to boost Zn reversibility via regulation of the electrolyte on a molecular level. By adding for example methanol into ZnSO4 electrolyte, the free water and coordinated water in Zn2+ solvation sheath gradually interact with the antisolvent, which minimizes water activity and weakens Zn2+ solvation. Concomitantly, dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition occurs via change in the deposition orientation, as evidenced by in situ optical microscopy. Zn reversibility is significantly boosted in antisolvent electrolyte of 50&#8201;% methanol by volume (Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50&#8201;%) even under harsh environments of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the suppressed side reactions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50&#8201;% electrolyte significantly enhance performance of Zn/polyaniline coin and pouch cells. We demonstrate this low&#8208;cost strategy can be readily generalized to other solvents, indicating its practical universality. Results will be of immediate interest and benefit to a range of researchers in electrochemistry and energy storage.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antisolvent addition has been widely studied in crystallization in the pharmaceutical industries by breaking the solvation balance of the original solution. Here we report a similar antisolvent strategy to boost Zn reversibility via regulation of the electrolyte on a molecular level. By adding for example methanol into ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte, the free water and coordinated water in Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation sheath gradually interact with the antisolvent, which minimizes water activity and weakens Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation. Concomitantly, dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition occurs via change in the deposition orientation, as evidenced by in situ optical microscopy. Zn reversibility is significantly boosted in antisolvent electrolyte of 50&#8201;% methanol by volume (Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50&#8201;%) even under harsh environments of &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the suppressed side reactions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50&#8201;% electrolyte significantly enhance performance of Zn/polyaniline coin and pouch cells. We demonstrate this low&#8208;cost strategy can be readily generalized to other solvents, indicating its practical universality. Results will be of immediate interest and benefit to a range of researchers in electrochemistry and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single Atom Ruthenium&#8208;Doped CoP/CDs Nanosheets via Splicing of Carbon&#8208;Dots for Robust Hydrogen Production</title>

A composite material was synthesized in which CoP nanoparticles, doped with single&#8208;atom Ru sites, are supported on single&#8208;particle thick nanosheets formed by splicing of CDs (Ru1CoP/CDs). The catalyst prepared under optimized conditions displayed an outstanding stability and activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline and acidic conditions.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional catalysts are attracting attention in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work describe a composite material design in which CoP nanoparticles doped with Ru single&#8208;atom sites supported on carbon dots (CDs) single&#8208;layer nanosheets formed by splicing CDs (Ru1CoP/CDs). Small CD fragments bore abundant functional groups, analogous to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and could provide a high density of binding sites to immobilize Ru1CoP. The single&#8208;particle&#8208;thick nanosheets formed by splicing CDs acted as supports, which improved the conductivity of the electrocatalyst and the stability of the catalyst during operation. The Ru1CoP/CDs formed from doping atomic Ru dispersed on CoP showed very high efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide pH range. The catalyst prepared under optimized conditions displayed outstanding stability and activity: the overpotential for the HER at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was as low as 51 and 49&#8197;mV under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Density functional theory calculations showed that the substituted Ru single atoms lowered the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer energy barrier and promoted H&#8722;H bond formation, thereby enhancing catalytic performance for the HER. The findings open a new avenue for developing carbon&#8208;based hybridization materials with integrated electrocatalytic performance for water splitting.

A linear ionic molecule forms a stable framework with open pores through X&#8208;aggregation packing, facilitated by a combination of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The nano&#8208;tunnel exhibits anisotropic guest diffusion, excellent chemical stability, large CO2 uptake with high CO2/CH4 selectivity, and vapochrometric behavior.







Abstract
Herein we report a linear ionic molecule that assembles into a supramolecular nano&#8208;tunnel structure through synergy of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The nano&#8208;tunnel crystal exhibits anisotropic guest adsorption behavior. The material shows good thermal stability and undergoes multi&#8208;stage single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transformations to a nonporous structure on heating. The material exhibits a remarkable chemical stability under both acidic and basic conditions, which is rarely observed in supramolecular organic frameworks and is often related to structures with designed hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Because of the high polarity of the tunnels, this molecular crystal also shows a large CO2&#8208;adsorption capacity while excluding other gases at ambient temperature, leading to high CO2/CH4 selectivity. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission of the molecules gives the bulk crystals vapochromic properties.

         <title>Selective Triazenation Reaction (STaR) of Secondary Amines for Tagging Monomethyl Lysine Post&#8208;Translational Modifications</title>

We report a novel chemoselective selective triazenation reaction, termed &#8220;STaR&#8221;, of secondary amines for the selective enrichment of monomethyl lysine (Kme) post&#8208;translational modifications from a complex protein mixture using diazonium ions under physiological conditions followed by the &#8220;traceless&#8221; release of the Kme peptides under mild acidic conditions.







Abstract
Lysine monomethylation (Kme) is an impactful post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) responsible for regulating biological processes and implicated in diseases, thus there is great interest in identifying these methylation marks globally. However, the progress in this area has been challenging because the addition of a small methyl group on lysine leads to negligible change in the bulk, charge, and hydrophobicity. Herein, we report an empowering chemical technology selective triazenation reaction, which we term &#8220;STaR&#8221;, of secondary amines using arene diazonium salts to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust tagging of Kme peptides from a complex mixture under biocompatible conditions. Although the resulting triazene&#8208;linkage with Kme is stable, we highlight the efficient decoupling of the triazene&#8208;conjugate to afford unmodified starting components under mild conditions when desired. Our work establishes a unique chemoselective, traceless bioconjugation strategy for the selective enrichment of Kme PTMs.

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Arylation of Enantiotopic Secondary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7245-7250, March 22, 2021. </description>

Chiral IBiox ligands show an exceptional reactivity and a high enantioselectivity in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylation of enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds. This reaction leads to a variety of scalemic indane products, containing a tertiary stereocenter, from easily accessible precursors.







Abstract
The enantioselective functionalization of nonactivated enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds is one of the greatest challenges in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation proceeding by an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism. Such reactions have remained elusive within the realm of Pd0 catalysis. Reported here is the unique reactivity profile of the IBiox ligand family in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular arylation of such nonactivated secondary C&#8722;H bonds. Chiral C2&#8208;symmetric IBiox ligands led to high enantioselectivities for a broad range of valuable indane products containing a tertiary stereocenter, as well as the arylation of secondary C&#8722;H bonds adjacent to amides. Depending on the amide substituents and upon control of reaction time, indanes containing labile tertiary stereocenters were also obtained with high enantioselectivities. Analysis of the steric maps of the IBiox ligands indicated that the level of enantioselectivity correlates with the difference between the two most occupied and the two less occupied space quadrants, and provided a blueprint for the design of even more efficient ligands.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Catalysis in a MoS2 Monolayer Activated by Long&#8208;Range Ferromagnetism for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: Beyond Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>

A possible way to trigger hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the basal&#8208;plane sites and make a MoS2 monolayer a single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalyst, is through long&#8208;range ferromagnetism order induced by magnetic cobalt ion doping. The effect of the doping promotes the hydrogen adsorption ability of basal S sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer catalysts with fully activated basal&#8208;atoms will provide a solution to the low loading&#8208;density bottleneck of single&#8208;atom catalysts. Herein, we activate the majority of the basal sites of monolayer MoS2, by doping Co ions to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. This strategy, as revealed by in&#8197;situ synchrotron radiation microscopic infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements, could activate more than 50&#8201;% of the originally inert basal&#8208;plane S atoms in the ferromagnetic monolayer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, on a single monolayer of ferromagnetic MoS2 measured by on&#8208;chip micro&#8208;cell, a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 could be achieved at the overpotential of 137&#8197;mV, corresponding to a mass activity of 28, 571&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the multilayer counterpart. Its exchange current density of 75&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 also surpasses most other MoS2&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental results and theoretical calculations show the activation of basal plane S atoms arises from an increase of electronic density around the Fermi level, promoting the H adsorption ability of basal&#8208;plane S atoms.

         <title>Enhancing the Sensitivity of Photoelectrochemical DNA Biosensing Using Plasmonic DNA Barcodes and Differential Signal Readout</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7316-7322, March 22, 2021. </description>

A differential signaling strategy allows signal&#8208;off and signal&#8208;on responses measured on a photoelectrochemical biosensor to be combined for enhanced limits of detection, sensitivity, and specificity.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices. We developed a new PEC biosensing strategy that uses differential signal generation, combining signals from two separate but correlated binding events on the biosensor, for improving the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection, sensitivity, and specificity of PEC DNA biosensors in biological samples. In this assay, the binding of unlabeled target DNA is followed by the capture of a signal amplification barcode featuring a plasmonic nanoparticle. The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit of detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15&#8208; and three&#8208;fold, respectively, compared to the previously&#8208;used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit of detection of 3&#8197;fM.

         <title>Auxetic Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanostructures from DNA**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7165-7173, March 22, 2021. </description>

This work introduces the first 2D auxetic nanoscale architectures using DNA origami. The structures show auxetic deformation behaviors with negative Poisson's ratios, which emerge from the periodic cellular configurations. A set of design guidelines are developed as the foundation for biomechanical metamaterials.







Abstract
Architectured materials exhibit negative Poisson's ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with regular materials. Their auxetic behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the materials used. The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by top&#8208;down approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we demonstrate two&#8208;dimensional auxetic nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations are performed by two&#8208;step DNA reactions and complemented by mechanical deformation studies using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the auxetic behaviors are mostly defined by geometrical designs, yet the properties of the materials also play an important role. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic DNA metamaterials.

         <title>Operando Investigation of Ag&#8208;Decorated Cu2O Nanocube Catalysts with Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction toward Liquid Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7426-7435, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2O nanocubes showed a remarkable increase (30&#8201;%) in the Faradaic efficiency for C2+ liquid products after the decoration with Ag nanoparticles. Operando spectroscopy revealed a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on CuOx as well as a certain Cu&#8211;Ag miscibility. These changes were coupled with significant variations in the binding of CO to Cu that favored the enhancement of the liquid product yields.







Abstract
Direct conversion of carbon dioxide into multicarbon liquid fuels by the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) can contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Here, well&#8208;defined Cu2O nanocubes (NCs, 35&#8197;nm) uniformly covered with Ag nanoparticles (5&#8197;nm) were synthesized. When compared to bare Cu2O&#8197;NCs, the catalyst with 5&#8197;at&#8201;%&#8197;Ag on Cu2O&#8197;NCs displayed a two&#8208;fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency for C2+ liquid products (30&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE), including ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, and acetaldehyde, while formate and hydrogen were suppressed. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu2O during CO2RR, accompanied by a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on the CuOx&#8197;NCs. Data from operando surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag&#8722;Cu sites formed during CO2RR that appear crucial for the C&#8722;C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.

         <title>Dual Ratiometric SERS and Photoacoustic Core&#8211;Satellite Nanoprobe for Quantitatively Visualizing Hydrogen Peroxide in Inflammation and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7323-7332, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;satellite gold nanostructure has been developed for dual ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of inflammation/cancer&#8208;related hydrogen peroxide. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease and the treatment progress could be monitored in real&#8208;time using ratiometric SERS and PA imaging.







Abstract
Excessive production of oxidative species alters the normal redox balance and leads to diseases, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. Oxidative species are short&#8208;lived species, which makes direct, precise, and real&#8208;time measurements difficult. Herein, we report a novel core&#8211;satellite gold nanostructure for dual, ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging to enable the precise detection of inflammation/cancer&#8208;related H2O2. The combination of H2O2&#8208;activated second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) PA imaging and SERS imaging enables the differentiation between the inflamed region and normal tissue with high accuracy. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease. Therefore, this core&#8211;satellite nanostructure can not only quantitatively and precisely monitor H2O2 produced in inflammation, tumor, and osteoarthritis in rabbits in real&#8208;time, but can also be used to track the progress of the anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment in real&#8208;time.

&lt;p&gt;A core&#8211;satellite gold nanostructure has been developed for dual ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of inflammation/cancer&#8208;related hydrogen peroxide. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease and the treatment progress could be monitored in real&#8208;time using ratiometric SERS and PA imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive production of oxidative species alters the normal redox balance and leads to diseases, such as chronic inflammation and cancer. Oxidative species are short&#8208;lived species, which makes direct, precise, and real&#8208;time measurements difficult. Herein, we report a novel core&#8211;satellite gold nanostructure for dual, ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging to enable the precise detection of inflammation/cancer&#8208;related H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The combination of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;activated second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) PA imaging and SERS imaging enables the differentiation between the inflamed region and normal tissue with high accuracy. The mesoporous silica shell of the nanoprobe could be used to deliver drugs to the target area to precisely treat disease. Therefore, this core&#8211;satellite nanostructure can not only quantitatively and precisely monitor H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced in inflammation, tumor, and osteoarthritis in rabbits in real&#8208;time, but can also be used to track the progress of the anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment in real&#8208;time.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Divergent, Strain&#8208;Release Reactions of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Carbinols: Semipinacol or Spiroepoxy Azetidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7360-7365, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols can be converted into a diverse range of 1,3,3&#8208;substituted azetidines or spirocyclic epoxides through either a semipinacol rearrangement or via iodohydrin formation followed by spirocyclization. The reaction pathway that operates is determined by the electronic nature of the activating agent.







Abstract
The azetidine moiety is a privileged motif in medicinal chemistry and new methods that access them efficiently are highly sought after. Towards this goal, we have found that azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols, readily obtained from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB), can undergo divergent strain&#8208;release reactions upon N&#8208;activation. Treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride or triflic anhydride triggered a semipinacol rearrangement to give keto 1,3,3&#8208;substituted azetidines. More than 20 examples were explored, enabling us to evaluate selectivity and the migratory aptitude of different groups. Alternatively, treatment of the same alcohols with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of NaI led to iodohydrin intermediates which gave spiroepoxy azetidines upon treatment with base. The electronic nature of the activating agent dictates which pathway operates.

         <title>Cryptic Sulfur Incorporation in Thioangucycline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7140-7147, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptic incorporation of inorganic sulfur into thioangucycline biosynthesis was confirmed to be non&#8208;enzymatic by heterologous expression, systematic gene deletion, and in vitro experiments. A stable epoxide&#8208;containing angucycline was identified as the final natural product and precursor to the thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines, likely as part of a hydrogen sulfide&#8208;mediated detoxification process.







Abstract
Sulfur incorporation into natural products is a critical area of biosynthetic studies. Recently, a subset of sulfur&#8208;containing angucyclines has been discovered, and yet, the sulfur incorporation step is poorly understood. In this work, a series of thioether&#8208;bridged angucyclines were discovered, and a cryptic epoxide Michael acceptor intermediate was revealed en route to thioangucyclines (TACs) A and B. However, systematic gene deletion of the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) by CRISPR/Cas9 could not identify any gene responsible for the conversion of the epoxide intermediate to TACs. Instead, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments conclusively showed that the conversion is the result of two non&#8208;enzymatic steps, possibly mediated by endogenous hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, the TACs are proposed to derive from a detoxification process. These results are expected to contribute to the study of both angucyclines and the utilization of inorganic sulfur in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Unveiling the Electrooxidation of Urea: Intramolecular Coupling of the N&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7297-7307, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
During urea electrooxidation over a Ni(OH)2 electrode the dehydrogenation reaction from &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)O can lead to spontaneous urea dehydrogenation. Spontaneous intramolecular coupling of the N&#8722;N bond and hydration of urea dehydrogenation intermediates play important roles in the oxidation path from urea to N2 and CO2.







Abstract
The nitrogenous nucleophile electrooxidation reaction (NOR) plays a vital role in the degradation and transformation of available nitrogen. Focusing on the NOR mediated by the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, we decipher the transformation mechanism of the nitrogenous nucleophile. For the two&#8208;step NOR, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the bridge between electrocatalytic dehydrogenation from &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)O, and the spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenative oxidation reaction. This theory can give a good explanation for hydrazine and primary amine oxidation reactions, but is insufficient for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Through operando tracing of bond rupture and formation processes during the UOR, as well as theoretical calculations, we propose a possible UOR mechanism whereby intramolecular coupling of the N&#8722;N bond, accompanied by PCET, hydration and rearrangement processes, results in high performance and ca. 100&#8201;% N2 selectivity. These discoveries clarify the evolution of nitrogenous molecules during the NOR, and they elucidate fundamental aspects of electrocatalysis involving nitrogen&#8208;containing species.

We present a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanoswitches, named folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches, that upon enzymatic repair could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. The nanoswitches are suitable substrates for different methyltransferases and allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.







Abstract
We present a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanoswitches that, upon enzymatic repair, could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. Such folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are synthetic DNA sequences containing O6&#8208;methyl&#8208;guanine (O6&#8208;MeG) nucleobases and labelled with a fluorophore/quencher optical pair. The nanoswitches are rationally designed so that only upon enzymatic demethylation of the O6&#8208;MeG nucleobases they can form stable intramolecular Hoogsteen interactions and fold into an optically active triplex DNA structure. We have first characterized the folding mechanism induced by the enzymatic repair activity through fluorescent experiments and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We then demonstrated that the folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are suitable and specific substrates for different methyltransferase enzymes including the human homologue (hMGMT) and they allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.

         <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on an Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7382-7388, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiSn atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) that consists of adjacent Ni and Sn, each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N4&#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N4), has been synthesized. By virtue of the synergistic effect and the enhanced utilization degree of the active site, NiSn&#8208;APC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a challenge. Demonstrated here is a NiSn atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consists of adjacent Ni and Sn, each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N4&#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N4). The as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays exceptional activity for the CO2RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752&#8197;h&#8722;1, a formate productivity of 36.7&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gSn&#8722;1 and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9&#8201;%), which are superior to previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts. Both experimental data and density&#8208;functional theory calculations verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of the *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. This synergistic catalysis provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkene Difunctionalization by Direct and Selective Activation of Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7405-7411, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization method for the direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds is developed. The significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp3)&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.







Abstract
Catalytic alkene difunctionalization is a powerful strategy for the rapid assembly of complex molecules and has wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry. Despite significant progress, a compelling challenge that still needs to be solved is the installation of highly functionalized C(sp3)&#8208;hybridized centers without requiring pre&#8208;activated substrates. We herein report that inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize decatungstate photo&#8208;HAT, in combination with nickel catalysis, provides a versatile platform for three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization through direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. Compared with previous studies, the significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary, and primary C(sp3)&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.

         <title>On the Redox Mechanism of Low&#8208;Temperature NH3&#8208;SCR over Cu&#8208;CHA: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Reduction Half Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7197-7204, March 22, 2021. </description>

A combination of transient response, kinetic, and computational methods reveals the crucial role of dinuclear Cu complexes also in the Reduction Half&#8208;Cycle (RHC) of the LT&#8208;SCR redox chemistry over Cu&#8208;CHA, and it explains the observed quadratic dependence of the RHC rates on CuII.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;CHA is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of NOx in vehicle applications. Although extensively studied, diverse mechanistic proposals still stand in terms of the nature of active Cu&#8208;ions and reaction pathways in SCR working conditions. Herein we address the redox mechanism underlying Low&#8208;Temperature (LT) SCR on Cu&#8208;CHA by an integration of chemical&#8208;trapping techniques, transient&#8208;response methods, operando UV/Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy with modelling tools based on transient kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations. We show that the rates of the Reduction Half&#8208;Cycle (RHC) of LT&#8208;SCR display a quadratic dependence on CuII, thus questioning mechanisms based on isolated CuII&#8208;ions. We propose, instead, a CuII&#8208;pair mediated LT&#8208;RHC pathway, in which NO oxidative activation to mobile nitrite&#8208;precursor intermediates accounts for CuII reduction. These results highlight the role of dinuclear Cu complexes not only in the oxidation part of LT&#8208;SCR, but also in the RHC reaction cascade.

         <title>Twin Pathways: Discerning the Origins of Multiply Twinned Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6858-6863, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical concepts for understanding the formation pathways of colloidal multiply twinned nanoparticles are reviewed. As the direct observation of two pathways has recently been achieved, new opportunities exist for acquiring a deeper understanding of twin formation and symmetry breaking. This knowledge will improve the synthetic control of nanoparticle shape and provide important insight into the thermodynamics of nanoscale systems.







Abstract
The structure of multiply twinned particles (MTPs) provides an example of how specific crystallographic features dictate the geometric shape of finite&#8208;sized crystals. The formation of MTPs during colloidal synthesis can occur through at least two different pathways: 1)&#8197;growth from multiply twinned seeds or 2)&#8197;the stepwise formation of new twin boundaries on single&#8208;crystalline seeds (either by particle overgrowth or multiparticle attachment). By utilizing in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy, recent studies have provided real&#8208;time evidence for both pathways. Looking forward, the knowledge of specific evolution pathways that occur under a given synthetic condition will aid in the design of robust MTP syntheses. More importantly, further studies pertaining to the structural evolution and energetics of nanoparticles are needed to provide a complete understanding of MTP formation pathways.

         <title>Back Cover: Impact of Organic Templates on the Selective Formation of Zeolite Oligomers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 13/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7448-7448, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT and kMC calculations were combined to investigate the impact of the most commonly used organic template molecules both on the reaction energy profiles and the kinetics of formation of silica oligomers, as described by Caroline Mellot&#8208;Draznieks, Carlos Nieto&#8208;Draghi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;7111. The extended reaction path mechanism (258 equilibrium reactions and 242 chemical species) up to octameric species showed that organic templates produce higher concentrations of four&#8208;membered&#8208;ring intermediates.

2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) serving as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy are reported by Omid&#8197;C. Farokhzad, Wei Tao, Tian Xie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;7155. SnNSs could also serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy and &#946;&#8208;elemene delivery. This study not only presents a strategy for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri&#8208;modal combination cancer therapy.

A new ligand&#8208;directed approach for synthesizing lacunary polyoxomolybdates in organic solvents, which afforded an unprecedented lacunary polyoxomolybdate, is presented by Chifeng Li, Kazuya Yamaguchi, and Kosuke Suzuki in their Communication on page&#8197;6960. By controlling the equilibrium of lacunary polyoxomolybdate ([&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;) with pyridine molecules in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, a selective structure transformation delivered the new lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722;.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6830-6830, March 22, 2021. </description>

Delicate control of the shell structure of hollow spheres leads to enhanced mass transport, as described by Dan Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;6926. The prepared hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) with close duplicated shells (yellow) and bubble&#8208;like shells (green) can promote gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure and accelerate liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force compared to the HoMSs with non&#8208;duplicated solid shells (red), thus exhibiting superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyzed Insertion Reactions with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6864-6878, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long overlooked for having poor reactivity, metal carbenes lacking strong electron withdrawing groups can insert into the C&#8722;H bonds as well as a variety of heteroatom&#8722;H (X&#8722;H) bonds using an array of transition metals. The reduced electrophilicity results in greater functional group tolerance, new modes of stereocontrol, and new products with a range of applications.







Abstract
Donor/donor carbenes are relatively new in the field of carbene chemistry; although applications in C&#8722;H and X&#8722;H insertion reactions are few in number, they demonstrate exquisite chemo&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Recent reports have shown that C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, B&#8722;H, O&#8722;H, S&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, Ge&#8722;H, Sn&#8722;H and P&#8722;H insertion reactions are feasible with a variety of transition metal catalysts, both inter&#8208; and intramolecularly. Furthermore, high degrees of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity have been observed in several cases. Methods typically involve the formation of a diazo&#8208;based carbene precursor, but procedures using diazo&#8208;free metal carbenes have been developed with significant success. This Minireview covers transition&#8208;metal catalyzed insertion reactions with donor/donor and donor carbenes, providing context for future developments in this emerging field.

         <title>Vinyl and Alkynyl Triazenes: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6879-6889, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl and alkynyl triazenes have emerged as highly versatile reagents in organic synthesis. The electron&#8208;donating character of the triazene function activates the triple bond of alkynyl triazenes, thereby facilitating addition, cyclization, annulation and rearrangement reactions. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, are convenient precursors for vinyl cations, and they can be converted via addition reactions into alkyl triazenes.







Abstract
Aromatic compounds containing triazenyl groups (N3RR&#8242;) have a profound impact on synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In contrast, the chemistry of vinyl and alkynyl triazenes was a largely uncharted territory until recently. The situation has changed over the last five years, and it has become apparent that vinyl and alkynyl triazenes are highly interesting compounds with a unique reactivity. The electron&#8208;donating properties of the triazenyl group provide alkynyl triazenes with an ynamide&#8208;like reactivity, which can be exploited in reactions of the triple bond. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, can be used for electrophilic vinylation reactions. The foundation for this new triazene chemistry are synthetic pathways which allow preparing vinyl and alkynyl triazenes in few steps from readily available starting materials. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in this area.

Nanotechnology based on functional nucleic acids (FNAs) is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials. In this Review, a number of common FNA nanomaterials are described along with their structures and applications. The most successful synthetic methods for the construction of highly developed FNA&#8208;nanomaterial systems are described.







Abstract
Functional nucleic acid (FNA) nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field between nucleic acid biochemistry and nanotechnology that focuses on the study of interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials and explores the particular advantages and applications of FNA nanomaterials. With the goal of building the next&#8208;generation biomaterials that combine the advantages of FNAs and nanomaterials, the interactions between FNAs and nanomaterials as well as FNA self&#8208;assembly technologies have established themselves as hot research areas, where the target recognition, response, and self&#8208;assembly ability, combined with the plasmon properties, stability, stimuli&#8208;response, and delivery potential of various nanomaterials can give rise to a variety of novel fascinating applications. As research on the structural and functional group features of FNAs and nanomaterials rapidly develops, many laboratories have reported numerous methods to construct FNA nanomaterials. In this Review, we first introduce some widely used FNAs and nanomaterials along with their classification, structure, and application features. Then we discuss the most successful methods employing FNAs and nanomaterials as elements for creating advanced FNA nanomaterials. Finally, we review the extensive applications of FNA nanomaterials in bioimaging, biosensing, biomedicine, and other important fields, with their own advantages and drawbacks, and provide our perspective about the issues and developing trends in FNA nanotechnology.

A radically new approach to the synthesis of 1&#8208;(dialkylamino)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via addition of diazomethyl radicals to hydrazones is described. This reactivity confirms the utility of the &#945;&#8208;diazosulfonium salts herein introduced as synthetic equivalents of the diazomethyl cation.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of sulfonium salts containing transferable diazomethyl groups is described, and the structure of these compounds is elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Under photochemical conditions, reaction of these salts with N,N&#8208;dialkyl hydrazones affords 1&#8208;(dialkylamino)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles via diazomethyl radical addition to the azomethine carbon followed by intramolecular ring closure. The straightforward transformation of the structures thus obtained into mesoionic carbene&#8211;metal complexes is also reported and the donor properties of these new ligands characterized.

The characterization of &#951;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;N2O and CO2 complexes of nickel and the associated computational study reveal that the bonding ability of N2O to nickel is intermediate between that of CO2 and that of H2C=CH2. It is shown that in general, N2O &#951;2&#8208;binds to metals comparably to or stronger than CO2, indicating that the rarity of &#951;2&#8208;N2O metal complexes is due mostly to its oxidizing character and not to its weak &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties.







Abstract
A nickel complex incorporating an N2O ligand with a rare &#951;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;coordination mode was isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, as well as by IR and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy augmented by 15N&#8208;labeling experiments. The isoelectronic nickel CO2 complex reported for comparison features a very similar solid&#8208;state structure. Computational studies revealed that &#951;2&#8208;N2O binds to nickel slightly stronger than &#951;2&#8208;CO2 in this case, and comparably to or slightly stronger than &#951;2&#8208;CO2 to transition metals in general. Comparable transition&#8208;state energies for the formation of isomeric &#951;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208; and &#951;2&#8208;N,O&#8208;complexes, and a negligible activation barrier for the decomposition of the latter likely account for the limited stability of the N2O complex.

         <title>Tailoring the Pore Size and Chemistry of Ionic Ultramicroporous Polymers for Trace Sulfur Dioxide Capture with High Capacity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6986-6991, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) hosting high&#8208;density of basic Br&#8722; anions in narrowly distributed ultramicroporosity achieved the deep removal of SO2 at ultra&#8208;low pressure with high uptake capacity and record SO2/CO2 selectivity (&gt;5000). The impressive thermal and water stability as well as the remarkable recycling performance make the IUPs a potential material for practical desulfurization processes.







Abstract
Here we demonstrate the deep removal of SO2 with high uptake capacity (1.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and record SO2/CO2 selectivity (&gt;5000) at ultra&#8208;low pressure of 0.002&#8197;bar, using ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) with high density of basic anions. The successful construction of uniform ultramicropores via polymerizing ionic monomers into IUPs enables the fully exploitation of the selective anionic sites. Notably, the aperture size and surface chemistry of IUPs can be finely tuned by adjusting the branched structure of ionic monomers, which play critical roles in excluding CH4 and N2, as well as reducing the coadsorption of CO2. The swelling property of IUPs with adsorption of SO2 contributed to the high SO2 uptake capacity and high separation selectivity. Systematic investigations including static gas adsorption, dynamic breakthrough experiments, stability tests and modeling studies confirmed the efficient performance of IUPs for trace SO2 capture.

         <title>The Total Synthesis of Chondrochloren&#8197;A</title>

A powerful alternative to the Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi reaction serves as the key transformation in the total synthesis of chondrochloren&#8197;A. Using a novel combination of the Hoppe anion in Matteson rearrangements serves to overcome the inherent synthetic challenges of the polyketide portion of chondrochloren&#8197;A and paves the way to its total synthesis. Remarkably, this transformation can be performed stereoselectively in the absence of sparteine.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of chondrochloren&#8197;A is accomplished using a 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement addition as an alternative for the Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi reaction. This transformation also avoids the inherent challenges of this polyketide segment and provides a new, unprecedented strategy to assemble polyketidal frameworks. The formation of the Z&#8208;enamide is accomplished using a Z&#8208;selective cross coupling of the corresponding amide to a Z&#8208;vinyl bromide.

         <title>Photochemically Activated Dimagnesium(I) Compounds: Reagents for the Reduction and Selective C&#8722;H Bond Activation of Inert Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7087-7092, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemical activation of dimagnesium(I) compounds, and subsequent high yielding double reductions, and regioselective C&#8722;H bond activations, of a range of normally inert arene substrates are reported (see picture, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Such transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free selective C&#8722;H bond activations hold considerable potential for organic synthesis.







Abstract
The photochemical activation of dimagnesium(I) compounds, and subsequent high yielding, regioselective reactions with inert arenes are reported. Irradiating benzene solutions of [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8722;; Ar=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dip) or 2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylphenyl (TCHP)) with blue or UV light, leads to double reduction of benzene and formation of the &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; cyclohexadienediyl bridged compounds, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C6H6)]. Irradiation of [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2] in toluene, and each of the three isomers of xylene, promoted completely regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activations, and formation of [(DipNacnac)Mg(Ar&#8242;)] (Ar&#8242;=meta&#8208;tolyl; 2,3&#8208;, 3,5&#8208; or 2,5&#8208;dimethylphenyl), and [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2]. Fluorobenzene was cleanly defluorinated by photoactivated [{(DipNacnac)Mg}2], leading to biphenyl and [{(DipNacnac)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}2]. Computational studies suggest all reactions proceed via photochemically generated magnesium(I) radicals, which reduce the arene substrate, before C&#8722;H or C&#8722;F bond activation processes occur.

         <title>Complex&#8208;Solid&#8208;Solution Electrocatalyst Discovery by Computational Prediction and High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6932-6937, March 22, 2021. </description>

Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8221;) promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis but expose the challenge of almost unlimited options in adjusting their compositions. We propose the utilisation of computational models, combined with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for the verification of the model assumptions, which allows for model refinement in iterative loops, understanding of binding mechanisms, and discovery of the most active composition.







Abstract
Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high entropy alloys&#8221;), comprising five or more principal elements, promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis due to the availability of millions of different active sites with unique arrangements of multiple elements directly neighbouring a binding site.

&lt;p&gt;Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8221;) promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis but expose the challenge of almost unlimited options in adjusting their compositions. We propose the utilisation of computational models, combined with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for the verification of the model assumptions, which allows for model refinement in iterative loops, understanding of binding mechanisms, and discovery of the most active composition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high entropy alloys&#8221;), comprising five or more principal elements, promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis due to the availability of millions of different active sites with unique arrangements of multiple elements directly neighbouring a binding site. Thus, strong electronic and geometric effects are induced, which are known as effective tools to tune activity. With the example of the oxygen reduction reaction, we show that by utilising a data&#8208;driven discovery cycle, the multidimensionality challenge raised by this catalyst class can be mastered. Iteratively refined computational models predict activity trends around which continuous composition&#8208;spread thin&#8208;film libraries are synthesised. High&#8208;throughput characterisation datasets are then used as input for refinement of the model. The refined model correctly predicts activity maxima of the exemplary model system Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru. The method can identify optimal complex&#8208;solid&#8208;solution materials for electrocatalytic reactions in an unprecedented manner.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hexagonal RuSe2 Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7013-7017, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal RuSe2 nanosheets (h&#8208;RuSe2), including 2H and 1T phases, are prepared in a one&#8208;pot colloidal synthesis. This new member of the family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) displays significantly enhanced HER performance. The structural phase change from h&#8208;RuSe2 to cubic RuSe2 takes place upon annealing at 600&#8201;&#176;C. This is a significant step forward in expanding the family of layered TMDs.







Abstract
Layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanomaterials are promising alternatives to platinum (Pt) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the family of layered TMDs is mainly limited to Group IV&#8211;VII transition metals, while the synthesis of layered TMDs based on metals from other groups still remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate by atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy that hexagonal RuSe2 (h&#8208;RuSe2) nanosheets with a mixture of 2H and 1T phases can be obtained by a facile bottom&#8208;up colloidal synthetic approach. The obtained h&#8208;RuSe2, which can be transformed into the thermodynamically favorable phase of cubic RuSe2 (c&#8208;RuSe2) only after annealing at 600&#8201;&#176;C, exhibits Pt&#8208;like HER performance, with a fivefold turnover frequency enhancement compared to the c&#8208;RuSe2 in alkaline media. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the enhanced adsorption free energies of H2O (&#916;G
), optimized adsorption free energies of H (&#916;GH*), and increased conductivity of h&#8208;RuSe2 contribute to its superior HER activity.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Borrowing Alkylation of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols in the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6981-6985, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scope of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming hydrogen&#8208;borrowing reactions has been expanded to include 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from both natural and unnatural amino acids. The vulnerable amine stereocentre is preserved in the reaction by the use of a bulky nitrogen protecting group (trityl or benzyl), with the products being readily cleaved under acidic conditions to the corresponding &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acids without further purification.







Abstract
For the first time we have been able to employ enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from abundant amino acids in C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming hydrogen&#8208;borrowing alkylation reactions. These reactions are facilitated by the use of the aryl ketone Ph*COMe. Racemisation of the amine stereocentre during alkylation can be prevented by the use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric base and protection of the nitrogen with a sterically hindered triphenylmethane (trityl) or benzyl group. The Ph* and trityl groups are readily cleaved in one pot to give &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) products as their HCl salts without further purification. Both steps may be performed in sequence without isolation of the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing intermediate, removing the need for column chromatography.

A method is reported for the selective silacyclization of (hetero)arenes via twofold C&#8722;H activation. An operationally convenient and stable silicon reagent, octamethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxacyclohexasilane (ODCS), is employed.







Abstract
The use of an operationally convenient and stable silicon reagent (octamethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dioxacyclohexasilane, ODCS) for the selective silacyclization of (hetero)arenes via twofold C&#8722;H activation is reported. This method is compatible with N&#8208;containing heteroarenes such as indoles and carbazoles of varying complexity. The ODCS reagent can also be utilized for silacyclization of other types of substrates, including tertiary phosphines and aryl halides. A series of mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate the preferred pathway for this twofold C&#8722;H activation process.

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;Ion Conductivity in Superadamantanoid Lithium Thioborate Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6975-6980, March 22, 2021. </description>

A new class of lithium thioborate halides adopt an adamantanoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions within interconnected 3D structural channels and exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.







Abstract
Lithium thioborates are promising fast Li&#8208;ion conducting materials, with similar properties to their lithium thiophosphate counterparts that have enabled the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion batteries. By comparison, thioborates have scarcely been developed, however, offering new space for materials discovery. Here we report a new class of lithium thioborate halides that adopt a so&#8208;called supertetrahedral adamantanoid structure that houses mobile lithium ions and halide anions within interconnected 3D structural channels. Investigation of the structure using single&#8208;crystal XRD, neutron powder diffraction, and neutron PDF reveals significant lithium and halide anion disorder. The phases are non&#8208;stoichiometric, adopting slightly varying halide contents within the materials. These new superadamantanoid materials exhibit high ionic conductivities up to 1.4&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which can be effectively tuned by the polarizability of the halide anion within the channels.

         <title>Non&#8208;Metal Ion Co&#8208;Insertion Chemistry in Aqueous Zn/MnO2 Batteries</title>

A reversible H+/NH4+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism was developed in an aqueous Zn/MnO2 battery system. The co&#8208;insertion of H+/NH4+ ions in MnO2 endows the aqueous batteries with the fast kinetics of ion diffusion and the reversible structure evolution of MnO2 due to the synergistic effect between the dual cations. As a result, such Zn/MnO2 batteries display enhanced electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The co&#8208;insertion of dual ions can often offer enhanced electrochemical performance for the aqueous zinc batteries. Although the insertion of non&#8208;metallic ions has been achieved in aqueous zinc batteries, the co&#8208;insertion chemistry of non&#8208;metallic cations is still a challenge. Here, a reversible H+/NH4+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism was developed in an aqueous Zn/MnO2 battery system. The synergistic effect between the dual cations endows the aqueous batteries with the fast kinetics of ion diffusion and the reversible structure evolution of MnO2. As a result, the Zn/MnO2 battery displays excellent rate capability and cycling performance. This work will pave the way toward the design of aqueous rechargeable batteries with non&#8208;metallic ions.

         <title>Amine&#8208;to&#8208;Azide Conversion on Native RNA via Metal&#8208;Free Diazotransfer Opens New Avenues for RNA Manipulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6970-6974, March 22, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA using the reagent FSO2N3 selectively provides azide&#8208;modified RNA in quantitative yields. The stereochemically controlled reaction opens new avenues for the synthesis of RNA&#8208;peptide conjugates and for the isolation of cellular RNA containing post&#8208;transcriptional nucleotide modifications with an aliphatic primary amino group, such as acp3U.







Abstract
A major challenge in the field of RNA chemistry is the identification of selective and quantitative conversion reactions on RNA that can be used for tagging and any other RNA tool development. Here, we introduce metal&#8208;free diazotransfer on native RNA containing an aliphatic primary amino group using the diazotizing reagent fluorosulfuryl azide (FSO2N3). The reaction provides the corresponding azide&#8208;modified RNA in nearly quantitatively yields without affecting the nucleobase amino groups. The obtained azido&#8208;RNA can then be further processed utilizing well&#8208;established bioortho&#8208;gonal reactions, such as azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (Click) or Staudinger ligations. We exemplify the robustness of this approach for the synthesis of peptidyl&#8208;tRNA mimics and for the pull&#8208;down of 3&#8208;(3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U)&#8208; and lysidine (k2C)&#8208;containing tRNAs of an Escherichia coli tRNA pool isolated from cellular extracts. Our approach therefore adds a new dimension to the targeted chemical manipulation of diverse RNA species.

Reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylanilines with prochiral cyclopentenes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, a chiral bidentate pyrox ligand and O2 as terminal oxidant affords structurally diverse indole&#8208;cyclopentene conjugates bearing two stereocenters in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective manner.







Abstract
Domino processes initiated by intramolecular nucleopalladation of alkynes have been developed into powerful synthetic tools for the synthesis of functionalized heterocycles. However, a catalytic enantioselective version of this class of reactions remains scarce. We report herein that reaction of 2&#8208;alkynylanilines with prochiral cyclopentenes in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, a chiral bidentate pyrox ligand and O2 as terminal oxidant affords the structurally diverse indole&#8208;cyclopentene conjugates bearing two stereocenters in a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective manner. One of the products is converted to a heavily functionalized tetracyclic indolinone derivative.

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6926-6931, March 22, 2021. </description>

With a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even duplicate the shell numbers with a narrow cavity between shells. Benefiting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP hollow multishell structures (HOMSs) with bubble&#8208;like shells and close duplicated shells can both form an effectively unique channel of water and gas, which can efficiently accelerate the entry of liquid and gas release.







Abstract
In the study of structure&#8211;property relationships for rational materials design, hollow multishell structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shell structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for enhanced capillary force. It can provide effective channels for water and gas and thus exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Chromoselective Photocatalysis Enables Stereocomplementary Biocatalytic Pathways**

Green or blue? The wavelength controls the outcome. Chromoselective activation of a carbon nitride generates electron holes with different oxidation potentials that are used for selective oxidation processes. By coupling the photocatalytic reactions with biocatalysis the (S)&#8208; or the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of 1&#8208;phenylethanol was synthesized stereoselectively.







Abstract
Controlling the selectivity of a chemical reaction with external stimuli is common in thermal processes, but rare in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. Here we show that the redox potential of a carbon nitride photocatalyst (CN&#8208;OA&#8208;m) can be tuned by changing the irradiation wavelength to generate electron holes with different oxidation potentials. This tuning was the key to realizing photo&#8208;chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascades that give either the (S)&#8208; or the (R)&#8208;enantiomer of phenylethanol. In combination with an unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita, green light irradiation of CN&#8208;OA&#8208;m led to the enantioselective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene to (R)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (99&#8201;% ee). In contrast, blue light irradiation triggered the photocatalytic oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, which in turn was enantioselectively reduced with an alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus ruber to form (S)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (93&#8201;% ee).

In contrast, blue light irradiation triggered the photocatalytic oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, which in turn was enantioselectively reduced with an alcohol dehydrogenase from &lt;i&gt;Rhodococcus ruber&lt;/i&gt; to form (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol (93&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Independent Luminescent Lifetime and Intensity Tuning of Upconversion Nanoparticles by Gradient Doping for Multiplexed Encoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7041-7045, March 22, 2021. </description>

The lanthanide sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was studied. With gradient doping, independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning is realized.







Abstract
Luminescent materials with engineered optical properties have been developed for multiplexed labeling detection, where encoding capacity plays a pivotal role in the efficiency. However, multi&#8208;dimensional optical identities are usually not independent which essentially hinder the practical encoding numbers to access theoretical capacity. In this work, we carefully studied the sensitizer gradient doping structure in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) excitable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and managed to achieve independent emission intensity and lifetime tuning. With the orthogonally tunability, it breaks the constraint of intensity (k) and lifetime (n) correlation and expands the practical encoding number to theoretical value as (k+1)n&#8722;1 in binary encoding. This method can also be combined with previous lifetime engineering as well to realize high level multiplexing.

         <title>A Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Stabilized Triplet Carbon Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7002-7006, March 22, 2021. </description>

Naphthalene/anthracene&#8208;fused porphyrins were synthesized by a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and subsequent intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and oxidation. The structures of 3Ni, 6Ni, 9Ni, 11Ni, and 13Ni have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. 11Ni is characterized as a surprisingly stable radical (t1/2=28&#8197;days under ambient air and at 80&#8201;&#176;C) that is storable for more than several months, despite its high&#8208;spin triplet ground&#8208;state carbon diradical.







Abstract
The synthesis of robust high&#8208;spin carbon radicals is an important topic in organic chemistry. Toward this end, several porphyrin&#8208;stabilized radicals have been systematically explored. A singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical was synthesized by a reaction sequence consisting of a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of &#946;&#8208;borylated porphyrin with 2&#8208;bromobenzaldehyde, addition of mesityl Grignard reagent, intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, and final oxidation with DDQ or tBuOK/O2. This strategy was also used to synthesize doubly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrins and syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;fused&#8208;anthracene&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers. While singly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrin radical has been shown to be a stable monoradical, doubly naphthalene&#8208;fused porphyrins and anti&#8208;fused&#8208;anthracene&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been shown to be closed&#8208;shell molecules. Finally, the syn&#8208;dimer was characterized as a surprisingly stable radical (t1/2=28&#8197;days under ambient air and at 80&#8201;&#176;C) that is storable for more than several months, despite its high&#8208;spin triplet ground&#8208;state carbon diradical.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Approach in Polyoxometalate Synthesis: Formation of a New Divacant Lacunary Polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722;</title>

Pyridine&#8208;induced selective structure transformation of lacunary polyoxomolybdate [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722; led to a previously unknown divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate bearing pyridine molecules (py) as protecting groups, [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O34(py)2]3&#8722;, in organic solvents. Lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O34(py)2]3&#8722; can act as a synthetic precursor of a POM&#8211;organic hybrid structure.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) have received increasing attention over the last decades for extending their application and properties that originate from novel structures. For the synthesis of a variety of POM structures, multivacant lacunary POMs are key precursors, which are typically synthesized by empirically controlling the complex equilibrium in aqueous solvents. Unfortunately, despite the excellent catalytic and electrochemical properties of &#8220;polyoxomolybdates&#8221;, only one multivacant lacunary species, i.e., [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;, has been identified and isolated because multivacant lacunary polyoxomolybdates are typically unstable. Here we report a ligand&#8208;directed approach for the selective formation of an unprecedented lacunary polyoxomolybdate in organic solvents. By structure transformation of a pyridine&#8208;coordinated [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;, a new &#947;&#8208;Keggin&#8208;type divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722; was obtained, which can be further used as a precursor for synthesizing a POM&#8211;organic hybrid.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Multinuclear Gold Complexes with (Diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene and Oxygen Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6992-6996, March 22, 2021. </description>

Compounds [(&#956;&#8208;OH){AuL}2][BF4] and [(&#956;4&#8208;O){AuL}4][BF4] (L=(diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene) undergo facile auration at their ferrocene units to produce isomeric tetragold(I) complexes. Conversely, the gold hydroxide [Au(OH)L] rearranges to a unique heptanuclear Au0/AuI cluster [Au7L6]OH. [Au(OH)L] also opens access to Au&#8208;aryl complexes and polynuclear Au complexes with N&#8208;bridging ligands.







Abstract
AuI complexes combining hard oxygen and soft (diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene (L) ligands in their molecules were synthesized, viz. the gold hydroxides [Au(OH)(L&#8208;&#954;P)] (5) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}2(&#956;&#8208;OH)][BF4] (4), and the oxonium cluster [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}3(&#956;3&#8208;O)][BF4] (1). In&#8208;situ auration of 1 produced [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}4(&#956;4&#8208;O)][BF4]2 (2), which spontaneously converted into a dimeric tetragold complex featuring bridging phosphanylferrocenyl groups geminally diaurated in position 2 of the ferrocene scaffold. The same complex and its isomer incorporating ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl bridges resulted similarly from 4. Upon crystallization, compound 5 underwent a redox reaction, producing a structurally unique, crown&#8208;like, mixed&#8208;valent Au0/AuI cluster, [Au7(L&#8208;&#954;P)6]OH. Compounds 1 and 5 were used to prepare the analogous, N&#8208;bridged complexes, [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}3(&#956;3&#8208;NFc)][BF4] (Fc=ferrocenyl) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;P)}4(&#956;4&#8208;N)][BF4]. The compounds were structurally characterized and further studied by DFT calculations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes combining hard oxygen and soft (diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene (L) ligands in their molecules were synthesized, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. the gold hydroxides [Au(OH)(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&#8208;OH)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and the oxonium cluster [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;O)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). In&#8208;situ auration of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; produced [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;O)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), which spontaneously converted into a dimeric tetragold complex featuring bridging phosphanylferrocenyl groups geminally diaurated in position 2 of the ferrocene scaffold. The same complex and its isomer incorporating ferrocene&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;diyl bridges resulted similarly from &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Upon crystallization, compound &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; underwent a redox reaction, producing a structurally unique, crown&#8208;like, mixed&#8208;valent Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; cluster, [Au&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]OH. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; were used to prepare the analogous, N&#8208;bridged complexes, [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;NFc)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (Fc=ferrocenyl) and [{Au(L&#8208;&#954;&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;N)][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. The compounds were structurally characterized and further studied by DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Dissolution and Polymerization of Mo in Ni4Mo Alloy for Promoting the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7051-7055, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiMo alloys, as one of the most efficient electrocatalysts in the alkaline electrolyzer, are unstable during the alkaline hydrogen evolution. An in situ transformation including oxidative dissolution of Mo in the form of MoO42&#8722;, the re&#8208;adsorption of MoO42&#8722;, the polymerization of MoO42&#8722; to Mo2O72&#8722;, and the activity promotion by the Mo2O72&#8722; is presented.







Abstract
NiMo alloys are efficient electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolyzer for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Metals are usually considered to be stable during the cathodic process. However, the actual behaviors of Mo in the NiMo alloys are unexplored. Here, we present the instability of Mo in the Ni4Mo alloy as a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. Mo in Ni4Mo is oxidized and dissolved in the form of MoO42&#8722; first. The dissolved MoO42&#8722; will re&#8208;adsorb on the electrode surface and polymerize. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption of the dimer Mo2O72&#8722; can promote the HER activity of metal Ni. The addition of MoO42&#8722; to the electrolyte can not only repair the durability of Ni4Mo alloy, but also facilitate the HER activity of pure metal of Ni, Fe, and Co. Our findings provide insight into the structural transformation mechanism and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of cathodic materials under the reaction conditions.

The visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes is reported. The reactions are carried out under mild conditions and feature a wide substrate scope. A large array of polycyclic indoline derivatives is afforded via dearomative [4+2] or [2+2] cycloaddition pathways in high yields with exclusive diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Herein we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular double dearomative cycloaddition of arenes. Compared with the well&#8208;known photodimerization of arenes under ultraviolet irradiation, the current reactions are carried out under mild conditions and feature wide substrate scope. A large array of structurally&#8208;diverse polycyclic indoline derivatives is afforded in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with exclusive diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) via dearomative [4+2] or [2+2] pathway.

         <title>Assembly of &#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl Nitriles via Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>

Cu&#8208;catalyzed formation of &#945;&#8208;(hetero)aryl nitriles from (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with a broad reaction scope by using two pyridine&#8208;embodied oxalamide ligands.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl nitriles are important structural motifs for pharmaceutical design. The known methods for direct synthesis of these compounds via coupling with (hetero)aryl halides suffer from narrow reaction scope. Herein, we report that the combination of copper salts and oxalic diamides enables the coupling of a variety of (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br) and ethyl cyanoacetate under mild conditions, affording &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylacetonitriles via one&#8208;pot decarboxylation. Additionally, the CuBr/oxalic diamide catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted ethyl cyanoacetates proceeds smoothly at 60&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl (hetero)arylacetonitriles after decarboxylation. The method features a general substrate scope and is compatible with various functionalities and heteroaryls.

A fast, easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform, mild and high&#8208;yielding chemoselective amide&#8208;forming ligation of acylsilanes with O&#8208;diethylcarbamoyl&#8208;derived hydroxylamines under aqueous conditions is reported. The reaction is mediated by citric acid and tolerates a wide range of reactive functional groups as demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage modifications of a panel of drugs, peptides, natural products and biologically active molecules.







Abstract
We report the facile amide&#8208;forming ligation of acylsilanes with hydroxylamines (ASHA ligation) under aqueous conditions. The ligation is fast, chemoselective, mild, high&#8208;yielding and displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. Late&#8208;stage modifications of an array of marketed drugs, peptides, natural products, and biologically active compounds showcase the robustness and functional&#8208;group tolerance of the reaction. The key to the success of the reaction could be the possible formation of the strong Si&#8722;O bond via a Brook&#8208;type rearrangement. Given its simplicity and efficiency, this ligation has the potential to unfold new applications in the areas of medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.

         <title>Anionic Bisoxazoline Ligands Enable Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Radical Azidation of Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6997-7001, March 22, 2021. </description>

An unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides is reported, in which arrays of acrylamides can be converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, employing an anionic cyano&#8208;bisoxazoline (CN&#8208;Box) ligand is crucial for the generation of a monomeric CuII azide species, rather than a dimeric CuII azide intermediate.







Abstract
Asymmetric radical azidation for the synthesis of chiral alkylazides remains a tremendous challenge in organic synthesis. We report here an unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides catalyzed by 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a copper catalyst. The substrates were converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent enantioselectivity. Notably, employing an anionic cyano&#8208;bisoxazoline (CN&#8208;Box) ligand is crucial to generate a monomeric CuII azide species, rather than a dimeric CuII azide intermediate, for this highly enantioselective radical azidation.

         <title>Photogenerated Holes Mediated Nitric Oxide Production for Hypoxic Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7046-7050, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated holes mediated oxidation was used to generate nitric oxide (NO) for hypoxic tumor treatment, which was achieved by poly&#8208;L&#8208;arginine modified carbon&#8208;dots&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 (ArgCCN). The holes with oxidizability were generated by laser irradiation of ArgCCN, which oxidized H2O to generate H2O2, and the H2O2 further oxidized the arginine residues to accomplish the NO production that is independent of tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signal molecule with multiple physiological functions, and it also plays a key role in cancer therapy. However, the production of NO which depends on O2 or H2O2 is limited within the tumor microenvironment, leading to unsatisfactory anticancer effect. Herein, we report a NO&#8208;based phototherapeutic strategy mediated by photogenerated holes for hypoxic tumors, which is achieved by irradiation of the poly&#8208;L&#8208;arginine modified carbon&#8208;dots&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterial (ArgCCN). Upon red light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on ArgCCN oxidized water into H2O2 which subsequently oxidized the arginine residues to produce NO. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the high concentration of NO produced by ArgCCN could induce cancer cell apoptosis. The presented phototherapeutic strategy is based on microenvironment&#8208;independent photogenerated holes mediated oxidation reaction, paving the way for the development of NO therapeutic strategy.

We describe a challenging and straightforward asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;naphthylamine and 2&#8208;naphthol by using a CuI/SPDO/air system. Optically pure 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted NOBINs were achieved that could be readily derived to divergent chiral ligands/catalysts. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations give a comprehensive understanding of the high enantioselectivity and good chemoselectivity.







Abstract
A challenging direct asymmetric catalytic aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;naphthylamine and 2&#8208;naphthol, using a novel CuI/SPDO system, has been successfully developed for the first time. Enantioenriched 3,3&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted NOBINs were achieved and could be readily derived to divergent chiral ligands and catalysts. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% ee) and good yields (up to 80&#8201;%). The DFT calculations suggest that the F&#8211;H interactions between CF3 of L17 and H&#8208;1,8 of 2&#8208;naphthol, and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the two coupling partners could play vital roles in the enantiocontrol of this cross&#8208;coupling reaction.

         <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host&#8211;Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6920-6925, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The host&#8211;guest noncovalent strategy was proposed to tune the stacking modes of metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets for isomer separation. Solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets, while the alkanes from C6 to C14 were likely to vertically enter the pores of nanosheets, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets as efficient isomer separator.







Abstract
The tuning of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr&#8208;1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host&#8211;guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12&#176;, 18&#176;, 24&#176; and 6&#176;, 18&#176;, 24&#176;, 30&#176;, respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns. This work uncovers a rational strategy to control the stacking of two&#8208;dimensional MOF nanosheets.

Phosphazene organocatalysts have been found to promote a highly&#8208;active, controlled, and selective alternating ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and cyclic anhydrides. This one&#8208;pot methodology leads not only to homopolymers but also to poly(ester amide)&#8208;based block copolymers.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic methodology for poly(ester amide)s by anionic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and cyclic anhydrides. Phosphazenes organocatalysts have been found to promote a highly&#8208;active, controlled, and selective alternating copolymerization in the absence of any competitive side reaction (zwitterionic mechanism and exchange transacylations). Mechanistic studies have shown first&#8208;order dependence of the copolymerization rate in N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and phosphazenes, and zero&#8208;order in cyclic anhydrides. This one&#8208;pot methodology leads not only to homopolymers but also to poly(ester amide)&#8208;based block copolymers. Two catalytic cycles involving ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines with cyclic anhydrides and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of N&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines have been proposed to explain the one pot synthesis of poly(ester amide)&#8208;based homo&#8208; and block copolymers.

&lt;p&gt;Phosphazene organocatalysts have been found to promote a highly&#8208;active, controlled, and selective alternating ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and cyclic anhydrides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a new synthetic methodology for poly(ester amide)s by anionic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and cyclic anhydrides. Phosphazenes organocatalysts have been found to promote a highly&#8208;active, controlled, and selective alternating copolymerization in the absence of any competitive side reaction (zwitterionic mechanism and exchange transacylations). Mechanistic studies have shown first&#8208;order dependence of the copolymerization rate in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines and phosphazenes, and zero&#8208;order in cyclic anhydrides. This one&#8208;pot methodology leads not only to homopolymers but also to poly(ester amide)&#8208;based block copolymers. Two catalytic cycles involving ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines with cyclic anhydrides and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;sulfonyl aziridines have been proposed to explain the one pot synthesis of poly(ester amide)&#8208;based homo&#8208; and block copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Couplings of Aryl Diazonium Salts in Methanol: PdII&#8211;Alkoxy as Reactivity&#8208;Controlling Intermediate</title>

Detailed systematic experimental and computational studies on the roles of transmetalating agent, solvent, base and the likely involvement of in situ formed diazoether derivatives challenge the currently accepted mechanism of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryldiazonium salts.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl diazonium salts are generally assumed to proceed via cationic PdII intermediates which in turn would be highly reactive in the subsequent transmetalation step. Contrary to this belief, we herein report our observation and rationalization of opposing reactivities of ArN2+ in Suzuki (=effective) and Stille (=ineffective) cross&#8208;couplings in MeOH. Our systematic experimental and computational studies on the roles of transmetalating agent, solvent, base and the likely involvement of in situ formed diazoether derivatives challenge the currently accepted mechanism. Our data suggest that the observed solvent dichotomy is primarily due to PdII&#8208;methoxy intermediates being formed, which are unreactive with arylstannanes, but highly reactive with arylboronic acids, complementing the Suzuki &#8220;Pd&#8208;oxy&#8221; mechanism with the direct demonstration of transmetalation of a PdII&#8208;alkoxy complex. Lewis acids were found to circumvent this reactivity divergence, promoting efficient couplings regardless of the employed conditions or coupling partners.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphor Embedded in Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticle with High Light&#8208;Harvesting Efficiency for Dual Photosystem Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 6955-6959, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared nanophosphor, ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ (ZGOCS@MSN), with high light&#8208;harvesting efficiency triggers the Emerson effect of the photosynthetic centers (PSI and PSII) to enhance photosynthesis. A suitable ZGOCS@MSN concentration increased the fresh weight and chlorophyll content of Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis and enhanced the electron transfer rate and its distribution in various plant parts.







Abstract
Light&#8208;harvesting and conversion ability is important to promote plant growth, and especially when resources are limited. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nanophosphor embedded with mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), ZnGa2O4:Cr3+,Sn4+ (ZGOCS), was developed and its optical properties were harnessed to enhance the photosynthetic ability of Brassica rapa spp. chinensis. The broad excitation of ZGOCS from the ultraviolet to the visible region allowed the conversion of extra light into near&#8208;infrared light (650&#8211;800&#8197;nm) and thus promoted the dual photosystem via the Emerson effect. ZGOCS@MSN was spherical with a size of 65&#177;10&#8197;nm and good dispersion. A light conversion ability of up to 75&#8201;% under different wavelengths was achieved. Moreover, the electron transfer rate of photosynthesis increased by 100&#8201;% with a suitable ZGOCS@MSN concentration. Plant and animal models were used to explore the effects of the nanophosphor. ZGOCS@MSN distribution was tracked by monitoring its NIR emission in plant and animal tissues, demonstrating that this nanophosphor can be potentially utilized in plant growth.

         <title>The Development of a Fluorescence&#8208;Based Competitive Assay Enabled the Discovery of Dimeric Cyclic Peptide Modulators of Ubiquitin Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 13, Page 7018-7023, March 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence&#8208;based competitive assay was developed, which enabled the high&#8208;throughput screening of various cyclic peptides targeting the Lys48&#8208;linked tetraubiquitin chain. This assay combined with chemical tools enabled the design of a potent dimeric cyclic peptide, which induced cell death with higher efficiency compared to its monocyclic analogue.







Abstract
Development of modulators targeting specific interactions of ubiquitin&#8208;based conjugates with their partners is a formidable task since it requires a suitable screening assay and homogeneous ubiquitin conjugates. We developed a novel high&#8208;throughput strategy for screening ligands for Lys48&#8208;linked tetraubiquitin chain in a relatively simple, fast, and affordable manner. This approach combined with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art toolbox of chemical protein synthesis and a specially optimized Cys deprotection protocol enabled us to design highly potent, Lys48&#8208;linked tetraubiquitin chain selective &#8220;next generation&#8221; dimeric peptide modulators. The dimeric peptide exhibited cancer cell permeability and induced cell death with higher efficiency compared to its monocyclic analogue. These features make our dimeric peptide a promising candidate for further studies using in vivo models. Our assay can be adopted for other various ubiquitin chains in their free or anchored forms as well as conjugates for Ub&#8208;like modifiers.

CHieF2 cyclopropanes: A biocatalytic method was developed for the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of CHF2&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes via myoglobin&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer. These biocatalysts offer broad substrate scope, enantiodivergent selectivity and could be applied to produce a difluoromethyl bioisostere of a drug candidate.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl (CHF2) group has attracted significant attention in drug discovery and development efforts, owing to its ability to serve as fluorinated bioisostere of methyl, hydroxyl, and thiol groups. Herein, we report an efficient biocatalytic method for the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of CHF2&#8208;containing trisubstituted cyclopropanes. Using engineered myoglobin catalysts, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl alkenes are cyclopropanated in the presence of ethyl diazoacetate to give CHF2&#8208;containing cyclopropanes in high yield (up to &gt;99&#8201;%, up to 3000&#8197;TON) and with excellent stereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% de and ee). Enantiodivergent selectivity and extension of the method to the stereoselective cyclopropanation of mono&#8208; and trifluoromethylated olefins was also achieved. This methodology represents a powerful strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of high&#8208;value fluorinated building blocks for medicinal chemistry, as exemplified by the formal total synthesis of a CHF2 isostere of a TRPV1 inhibitor.

         <title>Crystal Flexibility Design through Local and Global Motility Cooperation</title>

A flexible framework and its mobile aromatic substituents are connected via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction. The flexibility integration endows the PCP with distinct guest&#8208;free structures depending on the activation approach. The flexible PCP discriminates C6 alkane isomers by different gate&#8208;open behaviors, suggesting its application potential on petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating.







Abstract
Incorporating local mobility into a flexible framework promises to create cooperative properties unattainable in a conventional soft porous crystal. In this study, we propose a design strategy that integrates substituent moieties and a flexible porous crystal framework via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This integration not only facilitates framework structural transitions but also gives the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) different guest&#8208;free structures that depend on the activation conditions. The incorporated flexibility gives the material the ability to discriminate C6 alkane isomers based on different gate&#8208;opening behaviors. Thus, the PCP has potential applications in C6 isomer separation, a critical step in the petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating. This strategy, based on ligand designability, offers a new approach to flexible PCP structural and functional design.

         <title>Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray Scattering Studies of Block Copolymer Nano&#8208;Objects: Formation of Ordered Phases in Concentrated Solution During Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) can be used to prepare lyotropic phases comprising diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects in non&#8208;polar media. RAFT dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) at 90 &#176;C using a trithiocarbonate&#8208;capped hydrogenated polybutadiene (PhBD) steric stabilizer block in n&#8208;dodecane produces either spheres or worms that exhibit long&#8208;range order at 40% w/w solids. NMR studies enable calculation of instantaneous copolymer compositions for each phase during the BzMA polymerization. As the PBzMA chains grow longer when targeting PhBD  80  &#8208;PBzMA  40  , time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals intermediate body&#8208;centred cubic (BCC) and hexagonally close&#8208;packed (HCP) sphere phases prior to formation of a final hexagonal cylinder phase (HEX). The HEX phase is lost on serial dilution and the aligned cylinders eventually form disordered flexible worms. The HEX phase undergoes an order&#8208;disorder transition on heating to 150 &#176;C and a pure HCP phase forms on cooling to 20 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic protease activation on a multimeric synthetic protein scaffold via adaptable DNA&#8208;based recruitment domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexameric hemoprotein (HTHP) is employed as a scaffold protein for the supramolecular assembly and activation of the apoptotic signalling enzyme caspase&#8208;9, using short DNA elements as modular recruitment domains. Caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activation on the HTHP platform due to enhanced proximity is followed by combinatorial inhibition at high scaffold concentrations. The DNA recruitment domains allow for reversible switching of the caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activity state using short modulatory DNA strands. Tuning of the recruitment domain affinity allows for generating kinetically trapped active enzyme complexes, as well as for dynamic repositioning of caspases over scaffold populations and inhibition using monovalent sink platforms. The conceptual combination of a highly structured multivalent protein platform with modular DNA recruitment domains provides emergent biomimicry properties with advanced levels of control over protein assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Fast Alkali&#8208;ion Dynamics in Paramagnetic Battery Materials Combined with NMR and Deep&#8208;Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) technique has received extensive attention in&#160;characterizing alkali&#8208;ion battery materials, due to it&#160;is highly sensitive for probing the local environment and dynamic information of atoms/ions. However, precise spectral assignment cannot be effectively carried out through conventional density functional theory (DFT) methodology for the high&#8208;rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation&#160;to&#160;achieve the converged Na+  &#160;distribution at&#160;hundreds of nanoseconds,&#160;we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements.&#160;Accordingly,&#160;two&#160;  23Na shifts induced by different stacking&#160;sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2&#8208;type Na2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O2  &#160;for the first time.&#160;This&#160;new&#160;DPMD simulation auxiliary&#160;protocol presented in this work can be beneficial to&#160;a wide range of ssNMR analysis&#160;in the fast chemically exchanged material systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (  in&#8208;situ  ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by  in&#8208;situ  fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core  via  a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Nanoparticles with Programable Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Anti&#8208;Bacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extensive recent efforts have been put on the design of high&#8208;performance organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs), especially over NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;window (1000&#8208;1350 nm). So far, the development is mainly limited by the rarity of molecules with good NIR&#8208;II response. Here, we report organic nanoparticles of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs) with easily programmable optical absorption. By employing different common donor and acceptor molecules to form CTC nanoparticles (CT NPs), absorption peaks of CT NPs can be controllably tuned from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region. Notably, CT NPs formed with perylene and TCNQ have a considerably red&#8208;shifted absorption peak at 1040 nm and achieves a good photothermal conversion efficiency of 42% under 1064 nm excitation. These nanoparticles were used for antibacterial application with effective activity towards both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This work opens a new avenue into the development of efficient PTAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Locked Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers Showing Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically&#8208;locked D&#8211;A conjugated polymers have been prepared by incorporating methyl groups between donor and acceptor. Due to the methyl&#8208;induced hindrance, the correlated torsion is greatly increased to boost hole&#8211;electron separation. As a result of the decreased &#916;EST, poly(TMTPA&#8211;DCB) is able to emit a strong TADF, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 24.0&#8201;% and 15.3&#8201;% for doped and non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers often possess a significant frontier molecular orbital overlap because of the conjugation elongation, leading to no thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) caused by a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#9653;EST). Herein a novel steric locking strategy is proposed by incorporating methyl groups into D&#8211;A conjugated polymers. Benefitting from the methyl hindrance, the torsion between the donor and acceptor can be well tuned to form a sterically&#8208;locked conformation, so that the unwanted relaxation toward planarity and thus conjugation elongation is prevented to boost hole&#8211;electron separation. The resultant D&#8211;A conjugated polymer achieves an extremely low &#916;EST of 0.09&#8197;eV to enable efficient TADF. The corresponding doped and non&#8208;doped devices are fabricated via a solution process, revealing a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.0&#8201;% (79.4&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 75.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 15.3&#8201;% (50.9&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 47.3&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1).

         <title>Macroscopic Ultralight Aerogel Monoliths of Imine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO  2  drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (  ca  . 0.02 g cm  &#8208;3  ), high porosity (total porosity values of  ca  . 99 %), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt; 25&#8208;35 %) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (  e.g.  toluene uptake: 32 g g  &#8208;1  ), with high removal efficiency (  ca  . 99 %). Finally, we show that the same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials. We hope that our new procedure paves the way to a wider variety of macroscopic COF&#8208;based aerogels.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis&#160; suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of g&#8208;cyclodextrin (g&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo  154  }&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8208;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re  6  Te  8  (CN)  6  ]  4&#8208;  as exogenous guest. This seminal work brings better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly processes in general and gives new opportunities for practical applications in the design of complex multicomponent materials via the simplicity of the non&#8208;covalent chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Emissive Metallacages as Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials with high quantum yield and good processability is of vital importance in the preparation of organic light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages are prepared by the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridylphenyl)ethylene, cis&#8208;Pt(PEt  3  )  2  (OTf)  2  and tetracarboxylic ligands. These metallacages exhibit good emission both in solution and in the solid state because the coordination bonds and aggregation restrict the molecular motions of TPE synergistically, which suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of these metallacages. Impressively, one of the metallacages achieves very high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;  F  = 88.46%) in the solid state, which is further used as the coatings of a blue LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. The study not only provides a general method to the preparation of TPE&#8208;based metallacages but also explores their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials, which will promote the future design and applications of metallacages as useful emissive devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured NiO Films with Spin Polarisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral mesostructured NiO films are reported which exhibit chirality&#8208;dependent spin polarisations of the moving electrons under either applied voltage or photoexcitation. An asymmetric effective magnetic field is induced with electron motion in the symmetry&#8208;broken NiO. Thus, the antipodal chiral mesostructured NiO films exhibit asymmetric responses to the electron spin and result in opposite spin polarisations.







Abstract
Spin polarisation is found in the centrosymmetric nonferromagnetic crystals, chiral mesostructured NiO films (CMNFs), fabricated through the symmetry&#8208;breaking effect of a chiral molecule. Two levels of chirality were identified: primary nanoflakes with atomically twisted crystal lattices and secondary helical stacking of the nanoflakes. Spin polarisation of the CMNFs was confirmed by chirality&#8208;dependent magnetic&#8208;tip conducting atomic force microscopy (mc&#8208;AFM) and magnetic field&#8208;independent magnetic circular dichroism (MCD). Electron transfer in the symmetry&#8208;breaking electric field was speculated to create chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields. The asymmetric spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) generated by effective magnetic fields selectively modifies the opposite spin motion in the antipodal CMNFs. Our findings provide fundamental insights for directional spin control in unprecedented functional inorganic materials.

         <title>Access to functionalized Pyrenes, Peropyrenes, Terropyrenes and Quarterropyrenes via Reductive Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a versatile concept for the synthesis of fourfold functionalized, soluble pyrenes, peropyrenes, terropyrenes and quarterropyrenes.   They were obtained by a modular stepwise approach towards the rylene scaffold via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling, oxidative cyclodehydrogenation in the presence of caesium hydroxide under air and finally zinc mediated reductive silylation  . The silylated reaction products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The first example of a synthesized and crystallized quarterropyrene is presented and its oxidation reaction investigated. The functionalized rylenes were systematically characterized by means of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy showing a bathochromic shift of 80 nm per naphthalene unit and a nearly linear increase of the extinction coefficients. Cyclic voltammograms and DFT calculations identify them as electron&#8208;rich dyes and show a narrowing of the electrochemically determined HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and lower oxidation potentials for the higher homologues.</dc:description>

They were obtained by a modular stepwise approach towards the rylene scaffold via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling, oxidative cyclodehydrogenation in the presence of caesium hydroxide under air and finally zinc mediated reductive silylation  . The silylated reaction products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The first example of a synthesized and crystallized quarterropyrene is presented and its oxidation reaction investigated. The functionalized rylenes were systematically characterized by means of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy showing a bathochromic shift of 80 nm per naphthalene unit and a nearly linear increase of the extinction coefficients. Cyclic voltammograms and DFT calculations identify them as electron&#8208;rich dyes and show a narrowing of the electrochemically determined HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and lower oxidation potentials for the higher homologues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Biomimetic Oxidation of Amines using a Hybrid Hydroquinone/Cobalt Catalyst as Electron Transfer Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first Fe(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines. This oxidation reaction involves several electron transfer steps and is inspired by biological oxidation in the respiratory chain. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen is aided by two coupled catalytic redox systems, which lower the energy barrier and improve the selectivity of the oxidation reaction. An iron hydrogen transfer complex was utilized as the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation catalyst along with a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base complex as a hybrid electron transfer mediator. Various primary and secondary amines were oxidized in air to their corresponding aldimines or ketimines in good to excellent yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting in this work for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ intermolecular interaction in composite polymer electrolyte for ultralong life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries built with composite polymer electrolytes using cubic garnets as active fillers are particularly attractive owing to their high energy density, easy manufacturing and inherent safety. However, the uncontrollable formation of intractable contaminant on garnet surface usually aggravates poor interfacial contact with polymer matrix and deteriorates Li  +  pathways. Here we report a rational designed intermolecular interaction in composite electrolytes that utilizing contaminants as reaction initiator to generate Li  +  conducting ether oligomers, which further emerge as molecular cross&#8208;linkers between inorganic fillers and polymer matrix, creating dense and homogeneous interfacial Li  +  immigration channels in the composite electrolytes. The delicate design results in a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.43&#215;10  &#8208;3  S cm  &#8208;1  and an unprecedented 1000 cycles with 90% capacity retention at room temperature is achieved for the assembled solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic organic for robust high&#8208;capacity potassium storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active organics are investigation hotspots for metal ion storage due to their structural diversity and redox reversibility. However, they are plagued by limited storage capacity, sluggish ion diffusion kinetics, and weak structural stability, especially for K  +  ion storage. Herein, we firstly reported the lamellar tetrapotassium pyromellitic (K  4  PM) with four active sites and large interlayer distance for K  +  ion storage based on a design strategy, where organics are constructed with the small molecular mass, multiple active sites, fast ion diffusion channels, and rigid conjugated &#960; bonds. The K  4  PM electrode delivers a high capacity up to 292 mAh/g at 50 mA/g, among the best reported organics for K  +  ion storage. Especially, it achieves an excellent rate capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability with a capacity retention of ~83% after 1000 cycles. Incorporating  in&#8208;situ  and  ex&#8208;situ  techniques, the K  +  ion storage mechanism is revealed, where conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates to stably store K  +  ions. This work sheds light on the rational design and optimization of organic electrodes for efficient metal ion storage.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Pairing Approach to Stereoselective Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereochemistry can have profound impact on polymer and materials properties. Unfortunately, straightforward methods for realizing high levels of stereocontrolled polymerizations are often challenging to achieve. In a departure from traditional metal&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), we discovered a remarkably simple method for controlling alkene stereochemistry in photoredox mediated metal&#8208;free ROMP. Ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics, and solvation effects each had profound impact on the stereochemistry of polynorbornene (PNB). Simple modifications to the reaction conditions produced PNB with  trans  alkene content of 25 to &gt;98%. High  cis  content was obtained from relatively larger counterions, toluene as solvent, low temperatures (&#8208;78 &#176;C), and initiators with low Charton values. Conversely, smaller counterions, dichloromethane as solvent, and enol ethers with higher Charton values enabled production of PNB with high  trans  content. Data from a combined experimental and computational investigation are consistent with the stereocontrolling step of the radical cationic mechanism proceeding under thermodynamic control.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversed active sites boost the intrinsic activity of graphene&#8208;like cobalt selenide for hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;G  H  ) of active sites is essential to improve the overpotential of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we doped S to graphene&#8208;like Co  0.85  Se and found that the active sites are reversed (from cationic Co sites to anionic S sites), which contributes to the enhanced electrocatalytic HER performance. The optimal S&#8208;doped Co  0.85  Se has the overpotential of 108 mV (at 10 mA/cm  2  ) and Tafel slope of 59 mV/dec, which exceeds other reported Co  0.85  Se&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The doped S sites have much higher activity than the Co sites, with hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;G  H  ) closing to zero (0.067 eV), which reduces the reaction barrier for hydrogen production. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the intrinsic HER activity of other related transition metal chalcogenides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Colorimetric Method for Quantifying Cis&#8208; and Trans&#8208;Alkenes Using an Indicator Displacement Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation was developed to determine the percentage of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;alkenes. Using 96&#8208;well plates two steps are performed: a reaction plate for dihydroxylation of the alkenes followed by an IDA screening plate consisting of an indicator and a boronic acid. The dihydroxylation generates either erythro or threo vicinal diols from cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;alkenes depending upon their syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;addition mechanisms. Threo diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;alkenes. Further, blind mixtures of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;alkenes were made resulting in an average error of &#177; 2% in the percentage of cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;alkenes, and implementing E2  and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177; 3%. Furthermore, we developed variants of the IDA that alter the color changes to optimize the response to the human eye.</dc:description>

Threo diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;alkenes. Further, blind mixtures of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;alkenes were made resulting in an average error of &#177; 2% in the percentage of cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;alkenes, and implementing E2  and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177; 3%. Furthermore, we developed variants of the IDA that alter the color changes to optimize the response to the human eye.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal complex lipids for fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation in co&#8208;assembled phospholipid membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation in 1,2&#8208;dimyristoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine (DMPC) membranes using a metal complex lipid of type [Mn(L1)] (1; HL1 = 1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxybenzamide)&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;formyl&#8208;5&#8208;hexadecyloxybenzylideneamino)ethane. Small amount of 1 produces two separated domains in DMPC, whose phase transition temperatures of lipids (Tc) are both lower than that of the pristine DMPC. Variable temperature fluorescent microscopy for giant&#8208;unilamellar vesicles of DMPC/1 hybrids demonstrates that visible phase separations remain in fluid phases up to 37 &#176;C, which is clearly over the Tc of DMPC. This provides a new dimension for the application of metal complex lipids toward controlling lipid distributions in fluid membranes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new activity for the [NiFe] uptake hydrogenase 1 of  Escherichia coli  (Hyd1) is presented. Direct reduction of biological flavin cofactors FMN and FAD is achieved using H  2  as a simple, completely atom&#8208;economical reductant. The robust nature of Hyd1 is exploited for flavin reduction across a broad range of temperatures (25&#8211;70 &#176;C) and extended reaction times. The utility of this system as a simple, easy to implement FMNH  2  or FADH  2  regenerating system is then demonstrated by supplying reduced flavin to Old Yellow Enzyme &#8216;ene&#8208;reductases&#8217; to support asymmetric alkene reductions with up to 100% conversion. Hyd1 turnover frequencies up to 20.4 min  &#8208;1  and total turnover numbers up to 20,200 were recorded during flavin recycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Boric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vacant 
 orbital of boron contributes to the unexpected long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of boric acid, boron nitride, and fluoborite.







Abstract
For a long time, phosphors with long&#8208;lived emission are dominated by rare earth/transition metal ion&#8208;doped sulfides and oxides. Recently, organic materials capable of emitting long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are reported, carbon skeletons are almost the exclusive structural feature of the conjugated luminophores. Herein, we reported that boric acid, a non&#8208;metal and C&#8208;free material, could emit RTP with lifetime up to 0.3&#8197;s. Detailed investigations indicated the weak conjugation between the n electrons of the O atoms in the B&#8208;O confined space was the possible origin of RTP. Similar RTP was also found in electron&#8208;rich N/F systems, namely, BN and BF3 (BF4&#8722;). Importantly, the vacant 
 orbital of B was found to contribute to the relevant unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in excitation, which is different from previous reports on phosphorescence from arylboronic acids. The results confirm the unique role of B as a versatile structure motif for construction of new RTP materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Schizophrenia  (SZ) detection enables effective treatment to improve the clinical outcome, but objective and reliable SZ diagnostics are still limited. An ideal diagnosis of SZ suited for robust clinical screening must address detection throughput, low invasiveness, and diagnosis accuracy. Herein, we built a multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr  2  O  3  spheres (MHCSs) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) platform for the direct metabolic profiling of biofluids towards SZ diagnostics. The MHCSs displayed strong light absorption for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites. We profiled urine and serum metabolites (~ 1 &#956;L) with the enhanced LDI efficacy in seconds. We discriminated SZ patients (SZs) from healthy controls (HCs) with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.000 for the blind test.  We identified four compounds with optimal diagnostic power as a simplified metabolite panel for SZ  and demonstrated the metabolite quantification for clinic use. Our approach accelerates the growth of new platforms toward a precision diagnosis in the near future.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis has been exhaustively analysed aiming to develop a two&#8208;step concurrent approach. This strategy consists of a Meyer&#8208;Schuster rearrangement of a series of easily available propargylic alcohols followed by the stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, providing optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. Thus, the first concurrent cascade example involving the use of a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme is described, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under very mild conditions.

The chemoenzymatic approach was also successfully extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol and butynol derivatives.

         <title>The electrolysis of anti&#8208;perovskite Li2OHCl for prelithiation of high energy density batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anti&#8208;perovskite type Li2OHCl&#160;was previously studied as a solid&#8208;state Li+&#160;conductor. Here, we report that the Li2OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3 V or 4.0 V, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and the release of 2 eq. Li+&#160;via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the &#160;Li2OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3 V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of &#160;Li2OHCl starts at 4.0 V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3 V for the electrolysis of &#160;Li2OHCl . The electrolysis of &#160;Li2OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 812 mAh g&#8208;1  , with an equivalent Li&#8208;deposition or Li&#8208;intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode. Using &#160;Li2OHCl as the lithium source, silicon&#8208;carbon (Si@C) composite anode can be effectively prelithiated. The full cells composed of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2(NMC811) cathode and prelithiated Si@C anode exhibited increased capacities with the increment of prelithiation dosages.</dc:description>

Here, we report that the Li2OHCl can be electrolyzed at 3.3 V or 4.0 V, with the creation of O2/HCl gases and the release of 2 eq. Li+&#160;via two different decomposition routes, depending on the acidity of electrolyte. In the electrolyte with trace acid, the &#160;Li2OHCl is oxidized at a constant voltage of 3.3 V. In neutral electrolyte, the oxidization of &#160;Li2OHCl starts at 4.0 V, but the produced HCl will increase the acidity of electrolyte and lead to a voltage drop to 3.3 V for the electrolysis of &#160;Li2OHCl . The electrolysis of &#160;Li2OHCl delivers a lithium releasing capacity as high as 812 mAh g&#8208;1  , with an equivalent Li&#8208;deposition or Li&#8208;intercalation on anode, making it a promising candidate as a Li reservoir for prelithiation of anode. Using &#160;Li2OHCl as the lithium source, silicon&#8208;carbon (Si@C) composite anode can be effectively prelithiated. The full cells composed of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2(NMC811) cathode and prelithiated Si@C anode exhibited increased capacities with the increment of prelithiation dosages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Mediated C&#947;&#8722;H Functionalization of Alicyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes a new method for the transannular functionalization of the &#947;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds in alicyclic amines to install C(sp  3  )&#8211;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds. The key challenge for this transformation is controlling the relative rate of C  &#947;  &#8211;H versus C  &#945;  &#8211;H functionalization. We demonstrate that this selectivity can be achieved by pre&#8208;complexation of the substrate with Pd prior to the addition of oxidant. This approach enables the use of diverse oxidants that ultimately install various heteroatom functional groups at the &#947;&#8722;position with high site&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Bi&#8208;Sn Interface in Bimetallic Aerogel with 3D Porous Structure for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of CO  2  (CO  2  RR) into valuable hydrocarbons is appealing in alleviating the excessive CO  2  level. Herein, we present the very first utilization of metallic Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel for CO  2  RR with selective HCOOH production. Non&#8208;precious bimetallic aerogel of BiSn is readily prepared at ambient temperature which exhibits 3D morphology with interconnected channels, abundant interfaces and hydrophilic surface. Superior to Bi and Sn, the BiSn aerogel exposes more active sites and favorable mass transfer property and then endowing its high value of FE  HCOOH  with 93.9%. Moreover, the BiSn aerogel achieves FE  HCOOH  around 90% and maintained well for 10 h in a flow battery, indicating its potential applications in practical surrounding.  In&#8208;situ  ATR&#8208;FTIR measurement confirmed the formation of *HCOO is the rate&#8208;determining step toward formic acid generation. As a further evidence, DFT demonstrated the coexistence of Bi and Sn optimized the energy barrier for the production of HCOOH, and then yielding the improved catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Enables Heterogeneous Asymmetric Insertion of Carbenoids into Amines Catalyzed by Rhodium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of stable heterogeneous catalyst systems is a crucial subject to achieve sustainable society. Though metal nanoparticles are robust species, the study of asymmetric catalysis by them has been restricted because methods to activate metal nanoparticles without causing metal leaching were limited. We developed Rh nanoparticle catalysts (NCI&#8208;Rh) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as a solid ligand to strongly interact with metals for asymmetric insertion of carbenoids into N&#8211;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. Nitrogen dopants played a crucial role in both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity while almost no catalysis was observed with Rh nanoparticles immobilized on supports without nitrogen dopants. Various types of chiral a &#8208;amino acid derivatives were synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivities and NCI&#8208;Rh could be reused in seven runs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the corresponding continuous&#8208;flow reaction using a column packed with NCI&#8208;Rh. The desired product was obtained efficiently for over 90 h through the reactivation of NCI&#8208;Rh and the chiral source could be recovered.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluorinated Tetralins via I(I)/I(III)&#8208;Catalysed Ring Expansion: Programming Conformation by [CH2CH2] &#8594; [CF2CHF] Isosterism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saturated, fluorinated carbocycles are emerging as important modules for contemporary drug discovery. To expand the current portfolio, the synthesis of novel trifluorinated tetralins has been achieved. Fluorinated methyleneindanes serve as convenient precursors and undergo efficient difluorinative ring expansion with in situ generated p&#8208;TolIF2 (&gt;20 examples, up to &gt;95%). A range of diverse substituents are tolerated under standard catalysis conditions and this is interrogated by Hammett analysis. X&#8208;ray analysis indicates a preference for the CH&#8208;F bond to occupy a pseudo&#8208;axial orientation, consistent with stabilising &#963;C&#8208;H&#8594;&#963;C&#8208;F* interactions. The replacement of the symmetric [CH2&#8208;CH2] motif by [CF2&#8208;CHF] removes the conformational degeneracy intrinsic to the parent tetralin scaffold leading to a predictable half&#8208;chair. The conformational behavior of this novel structural balance has been investigated by computational analysis and is consistent with stereoelectronic theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Prodrug activation by gold&#160;artificial metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of phenanthridinium derivatives via hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An emerging approach in the field of targeted drug delivery is the establishment of abiotic metal&#8208;triggered prodrug mechanisms that can control the release of bioactive drugs. Currently, the design of prodrugs that use abiotic metals as a trigger relies heavily on uncaging strategies. Here, we introduce a strategy based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of a phenanthridinium&#8208;based prodrug via hydroamination under physiological conditions. To make the prodrug strategy biocompatible, a human serum albumin&#8208;based gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM), rather than of the free gold metal complex, was used as a trigger for prodrug activation. The albumin&#8208;based gold ArM protected the catalytic activity of a bound gold metal even in the presence of up to 1 mM glutathione  in vitro  . The synthesized drug via the gold ArM exerted a therapeutic effect in cell&#8208;based assays, highlighting the potential usefulness of the gold ArM in anticancer applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Force&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on persistent room temperature phosphorescence in purely organic luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has been a hot topic, especially for those with stimulus response character. Herein, an abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is reported, in which, purely organic luminogen of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F shows turn&#8208;on persistent phosphorescence under grinding. Careful analyses of experimental results, coupled with the theoretical calculations, show that the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group should be mainly responsible for this exciting result.

Herein, an abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is reported, in which, purely organic luminogen of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F shows turn&#8208;on persistent phosphorescence under grinding. Careful analyses of experimental results, coupled with the theoretical calculations, show that the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group should be mainly responsible for this exciting result. Furthermore, the applications of stylus printing and thermal printing are both successfully realized, based on the unique RTP effect of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Surface Ligands Reactivity of Metal Clusters by Bulky Ligands for Controlling Optical and Chiral Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play critical roles in determining the surface properties of metal clusters. However, modulating the properties and controlling the surface structure of clusters through surface&#8208;capping agent displacement remain a challenge. In this work, a silver cluster, [Ag  14  (SPh(CF  3  )  2  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  (DMF)  4  ] (  Ag  14  &#8208;DMF  , where HSPh(CF  3  )  2  is 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenethiol, PPh  3  is triphenylphosphine and DMF is N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide), with weakly coordinated DMF  ligands  on the surface silver sites, was synthesized by using a mixed ligands strategy (bulky thiolates, phosphines and small solvents). The as&#8208;prepared  Ag  14  &#8208;DMF  is a racemic mixture of chiral molecules. Owing to the unusually high surface reactivity of  Ag  14  &#8208;DMF  , the surface ligands are labile, easily dissociated or exchanged by other ligands. Based on the enhanced surface reactivity, easy modulation on the optical properties of  Ag  14  by reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; DMF ligation was realized. The mechanism was unraveled and rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. When chiral amines were introduced to as&#8208;prepared products, all eight surface ligands were replaced by amines and the racemic  Ag  14  clusters were converted to optically pure homochiral  Ag  14  clusters as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) activity and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). This work not only provides a new insight as to how to modulate the optical properties of metal clusters, but also unveils an efficient way to obtain atomically precise homochiral clusters for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>carba Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate:

Robust Cofactor for Redox Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a new robust nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate cofactor analogue (carba&#8208;NADP+) and its acceptance by many enzymes in the class of oxidoreductases. Replacing one ribose oxygen with a methylene group of the natural NADP+  was found to enhance stability dramatically. Decomposition experiments at moderate and high temperatures with the cofactors showed a drastic increase in half&#8208;life time at elevated temperatures, since it significantly disfavors hydrolysis of the pyridinium&#8208;N&#8208;glycoside bond. Overall, more than 27 different oxidoreductases were successfully tested, and a thorough analytical characterization and comparison is given. The cofactor carba&#8208;NADP+  opens up the field of redox&#8208;biocatalysis under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aromatic Micelle&#8208;based Saccharide Cluster with Changeable Fluorescent Color and its Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To develop a new type of synthetic saccharide clusters with changeable fluorescent colors, we herein designed a multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle. The new cluster forms in water through the quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The spherical assembly, with a ~2 nm&#8208;sized polyaromatic core and ~18 saccharide pendants, is stable even under high dilution conditions (up to 0.02 mM). The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from moderate blue (  &#934;  F&#160;  = 19%) to strong red, orange, and green (  &#934;  F&#160;  up to 67%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes in water. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters, both with and without the dyes, display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Segmented flow processes as an efficient tool to overcome hurdles of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis in organic solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In modern process development, it is imperative to consider biocatalysis, and whole&#8208;cell catalysts often represent a favored form of such catalysts. However, the application of whole&#8208;cell catalysis in typical organic batch two&#8208;phase synthesis often struggles due to mass transfer limitations, emulsion formation, tedious work&#8208;up and, thus, low yields. Herein, we demonstrate that utilizing segmented flow tools enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for three different biotransformations, the power of such segmented flow processes is shown. For example, a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion from 34% to &gt;99% and a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up leading to a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield from 44% to 65% compared to the analogous batch process was achieved in such a flow process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Spin Crossover Cobalt(II) Compound Induced by Polar Ligand Substituent Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric spin crossover (SCO) behavior is demonstrated to occur in the cobalt(II) complex, [Co(FPh&#8208;terpy)  2  ](BPh  4  )  2  (  1  ; FPh&#8208;terpy = 4'&#8208;((3&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) and is dependent on the degree of 180&#176; flip&#8208;flop motion of the ligand&#8217;s polar fluorophenyl ring. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures at several temperatures confirmed the flip&#8208;flop motion of fluorobenzene ring and also gave evidence for the SCO behavior with the latter behavior also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The molecular motion of the fluorobenzene ring was also revealed using solid&#8208;state  19  F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Thus the SCO behavior is accompanied by the flip&#8208;flop motion of the fluorobenzene ring, leading to destabilization of the low spin (LS) cobalt(II) state; with the magnitude of rotation able to be controlled by an electric field. This first example of spin&#8208;state conversion being dependent on the molecular motion of a ligand&#8208;appended fluorobenzene ring in a SCO cobalt(II) compound provides new insight for the design of a new category of molecule&#8208;based magnetoelectric (ME) materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Compression&#8208;driven internanocluster reaction for synthesis of unconventional gold nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Can the active kernels in ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) react with one another, or can the internanocluster reaction occur when they are in close enough proximity? To resolve this fundamental issue, we investigated the solid&#8208;state internanocluster reaction of the most studied gold NC Au  25  (SR)  18  (SR: thiolate) and revealed that a novel NC was produced by increasing the pressure to 5 GPa, whose composition was determined to be Au  32  (SC  2  H  4  Ph)  24  by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. As revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the structure consisting of a bicuboid Au  14  kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, has not been previously reported and endows the NC with obvious photoluminescence. DFT calculations also indicate the staples contribute substantially to the absorption properties. Further experiments reveal the pressure (internanocluster distance) can tune the internanocluster reaction, and the resulting product is not necessarily the thermodynamic product. Thus, the introduced high&#8208;pressure method would have great potential for synthesizing unconventional metal NCs with enhanced properties for applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary microfluidics for monitoring medication adherence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. Despite decades of work, hundreds of interventions, and thousands of publications, no significant global progress has been made in improving medication adherence. Even as early as 2002, a provocative review published in JAMA suggested that many of the studies on strategies to improve medication adherence produced only modest effects and that "innovative approaches to assist patients to follow prescriptions for medications are needed.[1] The goal of this minireview is to examine how recent work on microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication. Considering that an improvement in medication adherence can have a much larger effect than the development of new medical treatments, it is more than time for the research communities working on chemistry, biology, pharmacology and material sciences to consider developing technologies to enhance medication adherence. For these reasons, this minireview is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to provide a quick starting point for researchers interested in joining this complex but intriguing and exciting field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tertiary Alkylation of Terminal Alkynes with 1,3&#8208;Diesters via a Functionalized Alkyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with 1,3&#8208;diesters offers a direct access to highly functionalized alkynes. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even when employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. The products can be transformed into a series of versatile building blocks.







Abstract
Direct oxidative C(sp)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling offers an ideal and environmentally benign protocol for C(sp)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations. As such, reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity with respect to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage have remained a persistent challenge. Herein is reported a simple method for iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with readily available and versatile 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. Elaboration of the products enables the synthesis of a series of versatile building blocks. Control experiments implicate the in situ generation of a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical species.

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive Helical Motion by Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors in a Liquid&#8208;Crystal Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single light&#8208;driven motor embedded in a liquid&#8208;crystal network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.







Abstract
Controlling sophisticated motion by molecular motors is a major goal on the road to future actuators and soft robotics. Taking inspiration from biological motility and mechanical functions common to artificial machines, responsive small molecules have been used to achieve macroscopic effects, however, translating molecular movement along length scales to precisely defined linear, twisting and rotary motions remain particularly challenging. Here, we present the design, synthesis and functioning of liquid&#8208;crystal network (LCN) materials with intrinsic rotary motors that allow the conversion of light energy into reversible helical motion. In this responsive system the photochemical&#8208;driven molecular motor has a dual function operating both as chiral dopant and unidirectional rotor amplifying molecular motion into a controlled and reversible left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed macroscopic twisting movement. By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single motor embedded in an LC&#8208;network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Intramolecular Stereoselective Stetter Reaction Catalyzed by Benzaldehyde Lyase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzaldehyde lyase catalyzed intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction, that has not been observed in other ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes known in nature, was reported in this work. A series of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives, important building blocks in pharmaceuticals products, were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.).







Abstract
The reliable design and prediction of enzyme promiscuity to access transformations not observed in nature remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we present the first example of an intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction catalyzed by benzaldehyde lyase, guided by the rational structure screening of various ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After optimization, high productivity (up to 99&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.) for this novel enzyme function was achieved.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane Permselectivity Modification by Manganese(II) Acetylacetonate Vapor Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZIF&#8208;8 membrane separation performance is modified by a facile vapor&#8208;phase metal&#8211;organic treatment. Significant increase in selectivity for propylene/propane and hydrogen over other gases is demonstrated at the expense of reduced flux.







Abstract
Vapor&#8208;phase treatment of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with manganese(II) acetylacetonate (Mn(acac)2) allows permselectivity tuning. Propylene/propane selectivity increases from 31 to 210 after the Mn(acac)2 treatment at 165&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min, while selectivities increase from 14.6 to 242 for H2/CH4, from 2.9 to 38 for CO2/CH4, from 2.4 to 29 for CO2/N2, and from 2.9 to 7.5 for O2/N2, after Mn(acac)2 treatment at 175&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min. Stable equimolar propylene/propane mixture selectivity of 165 at ambient temperature and 4&#8197;bar equimolar feed with a propylene flux of 8.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1 is established. A control experiment excludes thermal treatment alone causing these changes. XPS analysis reveals the presence of Mn(acac)2 on the outer surface of the vapor&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8 membranes while no other changes are detectable by X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy.

         <title>A Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework Exhibiting Band&#8208;like Transport with Ultrahigh Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivate was used to construct a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1). Extended conjugated structures are facilitated for electron delocalization and transport, furnishing BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with semiconducting properties. Pellet samples of BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibited ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and demonstrated band&#8208;like charge transport character.







Abstract
Although &#960;&#8208;conjugated two dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively reported, developing fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COFs is still an extremely difficult problem due to the lack of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D linkers.

     alt="A Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework Exhibiting Band&#8208;like Transport with Ultrahigh Electron Mobility"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivate was used to construct a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1). Extended conjugated structures are facilitated for electron delocalization and transport, furnishing BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with semiconducting properties. Pellet samples of BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibited ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and demonstrated band&#8208;like charge transport character.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &#960;&#8208;conjugated two dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively reported, developing fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COFs is still an extremely difficult problem due to the lack of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D linkers. We synthesize a fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1) by designing a saddle&#8208;shaped building block of aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene (COThP)&#8208;CHO. As a consequence of the fully conjugated 3D network, BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 demonstrates ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature, which is one order of magnitude higher than the current &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D COFs. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements reveal that the charge carriers in BUCT&#8208; COF&#8208;1 exhibit the band&#8208;like transport mechanism, which is entirely different from the hopping transport phenomena observed in common organic materials. The findings indicate that fully conjugated 3D COFs can achieve electron delocalization and charge&#8208;transport pathways within the whole 3D skeleton, which may open up a new frontier in the design of organic semiconducting materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hybrid Wireframe DNA Nanostructures with Scaffolded and Scaffold&#8208;Free Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of scaffold&#8208;free modules to scaffolded DNA origami results in a hybrid architecture.







Abstract
The scaffolded DNA origami approach and the scaffold&#8208;free LEGO approach both demonstrate an extraordinary self&#8208;assembly capability for constructing all kinds of complex DNA nanostructures. Combining the construction elements of the two approaches, we introduce a hybrid framework to build wireframe structures in this study. A collection of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) wireframe structures are presented to showcase the simple and versatile design. Our development reveals more of the ever&#8208;expanding design space of structural DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Modulation of Charge&#8208;Recombination Dynamics in a Rosarin&#8208;Fullerene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A curved expanded rosarin and fullerene complex showed magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;recombination dynamics and triplet&#8208;state population in both low (&lt;100&#8197;mT) and high field regime (&gt;500&#8197;mT) mediated by the hyperfine coupling and &#916;g mechanisms, respectively. This result leads us to suggest that magnetic fields could be applied to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaics or optoelectronics.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;recombination processes are critical for photovoltaic applications and should be suppressed for efficient charge transport. Here, we report that an applied magnetic field (0&#8211;1&#8197;T) can be used control the charge&#8208;recombination dynamics in an expanded rosarin&#8208;C60 complex. In the low magnetic field regime (&lt;100&#8197;mT), the charge&#8208;recombination rate slows down due to hyperfine coupling, as inferred from transient absorption spectroscopic analyses. In contrast, in the high field regime, i.e., over 500&#8197;mT, the charge&#8208;recombination rate recovers and increases because the &#916;g mechanism facilitates spin conversion to a triplet charge&#8208;separated state (S to T0) that undergoes rapid charge&#8208;recombination to a localized rosarin triplet state. Therefore, we highlight the charge&#8208;recombination rate and the localized triplet state population can be modulated by the magnetic field in charge donor/acceptor non&#8208;covalent complexes.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Modulated Reactivity: An Acidic Silane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a &#8801;SiH group can be greatly altered by enclosing it into a strained bicyclic scaffold. The resulting silane is acidic with an experimental pKaDMSO of 4.7&#8211;8.1, lower than phenol, benzoic acid, and most hydrosilanes. It also shows strain&#8208;release Lewis acidity in the form of coordination of a THF molecule with its subsequent activation towards weak nucleophiles. The resulting ring&#8208;opening product shows high geometric fluxionality.







Abstract
Compounds of main&#8208;group elements such as silicon are attractive candidates for green and inexpensive catalysts. For them to compete with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal complexes, new reactivity modes must be unlocked and controlled, which can be achieved through strain. Using a tris(2&#8208;skatyl)methylphosphonium ([TSMPH3]+) scaffold, we prepared the strained cationic silane [TSMPSiH]+. In stark contrast with the generally hydridic Si&#8722;H bond character, it is acidic with an experimental pKaDMSO within 4.7&#8211;8.1, lower than in phenol, benzoic acid, and the few hydrosilanes with reported pKa values. We show that ring strain significantly contributes to this unusual acidity along with inductive and electrostatic effects. The conjugate base, TSMPSi, activates a THF molecule in the presence of CH&#8208;acids to generate a highly fluxional alkoxysilane via trace amounts of [TSMPSiH]+ functioning as a strain&#8208;release Lewis acid. This reaction involves a formal oxidation&#8208;state change from SiII to SiIV, presenting intriguing similarities with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated processes.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Evidence for the Promotional Effect of Acid Sites on the Diffusion of Alkenes through Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the acid site density on the diffusivities of alkanes and alkenes through the 8&#8208;ring windows of SAPO&#8208;34 was probed using a complementary set of ab initio MD simulations and experimental techniques (PFG&#8208;NMR and TAP pulse&#8208;response measurements). The presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites was found to have a clear promotional effect on alkene diffusion but it does not influence alkane diffusion.







Abstract
The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined zeolite pores can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments, and pulse&#8208;response temporal analysis of products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8211;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.

Simple, inexpensive, and robust cobalt&#8208;based systems catalyze the [2+2+2] cycloaddition between unactivated nitriles and diarylacetylenes, including aryl and alkyl nitriles and cyanamides as well as di(hetero)arylacetylenes. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines undergo mechanochemistry&#8208;enabled multifold cyclodehydrogenation to furnish nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with unprecedented skeletons.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and alkynes is an established synthetic approach to pyridines; however, these cycloadditions often rely on the use of tethered diynes or cyanoalkynes as one of the reactants. Thus, examples of efficient, fully intermolecular catalytic [2+2+2] pyridine synthesis, especially those employing unactivated nitriles and internal alkynes leading to pentasubstituted pyridines, remain scarce. Herein, we report on simple and inexpensive catalytic systems based on cobalt(II) iodide, 1,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and Zn that promote [2+2+2] cycloaddition of various nitriles and diarylacetylenes for the synthesis of a broad range of polyarylated pyridines. DFT studies support a reaction pathway involving oxidative coupling of two alkynes, insertion of the nitrile into a cobaltacyclopentadiene, and C&#8208;N reductive elimination. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines serve as precursors to hitherto unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via mechanochemically assisted multifold reductive cyclodehydrogenation.

         <title>n&#8208;Type Rigid Semiconducting Polymers Bearing Oligo(Ethylene Glycol) Side Chains for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, PgNaN and PgNgN, bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chain are developed with a fully conformationally locked backbone and deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of PgNaN exhibits a good performance on OECT devices with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a product &#956;C* of 0.662&#177;0.113&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
N&#8208;type conjugated polymers as the semiconducting component of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are still undeveloped with respect to their p&#8208;type counterparts. Herein, we report two rigid n&#8208;type conjugated polymers bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains, PgNaN and PgNgN, which demonstrated an essentially torsion&#8208;free &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone. The planarity and electron&#8208;deficient rigid structures enable the resulting polymers to achieve high electron mobility in an OECT device of up to the 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range, with a deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level lower than &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Prominently, the polymers exhibited a high device performance with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and the product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility &#956; and volumetric capacitance C* of 0.662&#177;0.113&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which are among the highest in n&#8208;type conjugated polymers reported to date. Moreover, the polymers are synthesized via a metal&#8208;free aldol&#8208;condensation polymerization, which is beneficial to their application in bioelectronics.

         <title>Tailoring the Microporosity of Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Advanced Gas Separation by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent gas separation performance and suitable stability and mechanical properties are simultaneously obtained via Al2O3 atomic layer deposition on PIM&#8208;1 membranes owing to the strong molecular sieving effect induced by Al2O3 deposition that tailors the polymer microporosity.







Abstract
Tailoring the microporosity of intrinsically microporous polymers at the atomic level is one of the biggest challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes. In this study, for the first time, the Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used to modify the microporosity of a typical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1) at the atomic level. PIM&#8208;1 with six ALD cycles (PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure&#8208; and mixed&#8208;gas separation, and anti&#8208;aging properties. The O2/N2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation performances were adequate above the latest trade&#8208;off lines. PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6 showed CO2 and O2 permeabilities of 624 and 188&#8197;Barrer, combined with CO2/CH4 and O2/N2 selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively. This significantly enhanced performance was attributed to the strong size sieving effect induced by the Al2O3 deposition.

         <title>Heterocyclic Ring&#8208;Opening of Nanographene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic segregation reaction with tetraazaanthraquinodimethane was performed on Au(111) by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscope at 4.3&#8197;K. A combination of high&#8208;resolution imaging and density functional theory calculations prove that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8211;substrate interaction, while the product is identical.







Abstract
Cyclo&#8208;dehydrogenation is of importance to induce the planarization of molecules on noble surfaces upon annealing. In contrast to a number of successful syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, it is still rare to conduct conjugation and cleavage of carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in molecules. Here, we present a systematic transformation of the C&#8722;N bonds in11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaanthraquinodimethane as well as three other derivatives on Au(111). With bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we discovered novel the &#8220;heterocyclic segregation&#8221; reaction of one pyrazine ring with two nitrogen atoms to form two quinoline rings with one nitrogen each. Density functional theory calculations showed that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening of N&#8208;heterocycles are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8211;substrate interaction.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Fe/Co Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bimetallic (Fe/Co = 1:2) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF, ~2.2 nm thick) via simple stirring of the reaction mixture of Fe/Co salts and 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;BDC) in the presence of triethylamine and water at room temperature. The mechanism of the 2D, rather than bulk, MOF was revealed by studying the role of each component in the reaction mixture. It was found that these 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under basic conditions. The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co&#8208;doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Single&#8208;Handed Helical Spiro&#8208;Conjugated Ladder Polymers through Quantitative and Chemoselective Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the unprecedented synthesis of one&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with well&#8208;defined primary and secondary structures, in which the spiro&#8208;linked dibenzo[  a  ,  h  ]anthracene fluorophores are arranged in a one&#8208;handed twisting direction, through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclizations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers composed of chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;spirobiindane and achiral bis[2&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. Intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were observed, whereas the precursor polymers exhibited negligible CD and CPL activities. The introduction of 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents on the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants is of key importance for this simple, quantitative, and chemoselective cyclization. This strategy is applicable to the defect&#8208;free precise synthesis of other varieties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and coplanar ladder polymers that have not been achieved before.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Homogeneous Glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain Reveals Different Binding Profiles of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 attaches to its host receptor, angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD glycoprotein is a critical target for the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenic integrity of RBD&#8208;based vaccines. Investigating the role of different carbohydrate domains is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there is no viable method for preparing RBD glycoproteins with structurally defined glycans. Herein we describe a highly efficient and scalable strategy for the preparation of six glycosylated RBDs bearing defined structure glycoforms at T323, N331 and N343. A combination of modern oligosaccharide, peptide synthesis and recombinant protein engineering provides a robust route to deciphering carbohydrate structure&#8722;function relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8208;10 &#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n = 3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (K  a  ) of (4.20 &#177; 0.23) &#215; 10  4  M  &#8208;1  for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46 &#177; 0.44) &#215; 10  5  M  &#8208;1  for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, host&#8208;guest complexation was shown to substantially enhance metabolic stability of PXG in presence of proteinase K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Cell&#8208;Matrix and Cell&#8208;Cell Junctions by Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell junctions are protein structures located at different cell membrane domains that determine key processes in multicellular development. Here we report spatially selective imaging of cell junctions by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy in a label&#8208;free manner. By regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or coreactant, the thickness of ECL layer can be controlled to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions. At a low concentration of luminophore, ECL generation is dominated by the oxidative&#8208;reduction route and confined to the electrode surface, thus revealing only cell&#8208;matrix adhesions located at the bottom surface of cells. While at a high concentration of luminophore, the catalytic route is involved and the ECL layer can be remarkably extended away from the electrode surface by decreasing the coreactant concentration, thus allowing the sequential imaging of cell&#8208;matrix and cell&#8208;cell junctions at the bottom and near the apical surface of cells, respectively. This strategy not only provides new insights into the mechanism of ECL generation but also promises wide applications of ECL microscopy in bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8211;Sensitivity of Au&#8211;TiO2 Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate that the Au&#8211;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on both Au nanoparticle (NP) sizes and TiO2 facets. Au NPs of &#8764;5 nm are more facile undergo Au&#8211;TiO2 SMSI than those of &#8764;2 nm, while TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than TiO2{101} facets. The resulting capsulating TiO2&#8211; x  overlayers on Au NPs exhibit an average oxidation state between +3 and +4 and a TiO2&#8211; x &#8208;to&#8208;Au charge transfer, which, combined with theoretical calculations, determines the Ti:O ratio as &#8764;6:11. Both TiO2&#8211; x  overlayers and TiO2&#8211; x &#8211;Au interface exhibit easier lattice oxygen activation and higher intrinsic activity in catalyzing low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation than the starting Au&#8211;TiO2 interface. These results advance fundamental understanding of SMSI and demonstrate engineering of metal NP size and oxide facet as an effective strategy to tune the SMSI for efficient catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have become increasingly popular for  in vitro  and  in vivo  bioimaging due to their excellent versatility and exceptional optical properties. Following a brief introduction on fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, as well as the merits of using polymeric NPs over other types of fluorescent probes, this minireview gives a concise summary of key advances made in recent years (2017 &#8211; 2020) in the use of polymeric NPs for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. We placed a particular focus on various strategies used for enhanced bioimaging applications, including polymeric NPs that encapsulate near&#8208;infrared dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogens, cationic dyes doped with bulky hydrophobic counterions, and semiconducting polymers. Next, we summarized the current limitations in some of these polymeric NP systems and offered potential solutions to overcome them.   Finally, we suggested, from our perspectives, some critical considerations in the design of polymeric NPs for future bioimaging and sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reactions of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron not exceeding two are challenging.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Supramolecular Iridium Catalysis Enabling C&#8208;H Bond Borylation of Pyridines with meta&#8208;Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of secondary interactions between substrates and catalysts is a promising strategy to discover selective transition metal catalysts for atom&#8208; economy C&#8208;H bond functionalizations. Unfortunately, the most powerful catalysts are still found  via  trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening due to the low association constants between the substrate and the catalyst in which small stereo&#8208;electronic modifications in the catalyst (and/or the substrate) can lead to completely different reactivity patterns. In order to circumvent these limitations and to increase the level of reactivity prediction in this type of important reactions, we report herein a supramolecular catalyst harnessing Zn&#8230;N interactions that bind to pyridine&#8208;like substrates as tight as it could be found in some enzymes. Furthermore, the distance and spatial geometry between the catalytically active site and the substrate binding site is ideal to target unprecedented  meta  &#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond borylations with enzymatic Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics, besides unique substrate&#8208;selectivity and dormant reactivity patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Separation of n&#8208;Hexane by A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Reduced Energy Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of  n  &#8208;alkanes from their branched isomers is vitally important to improve octane rating of gasoline. To facilitate mass transfer, adsorptive separation is usually operated under high temperatures in industry, which require considerable energy. Herein, we present a kind of dynamic pillar&#8208;layered MOF that exhibits self&#8208;adjustable structure and pore space, a behavior induced by guest molecules. A combination of the flexibility of the framework with the commensurate adsorption for  n  &#8208;Hexane results in exceptional performance in separating hexane isomers. More significantly, lower temperature prompts the guest molecules to open the dynamic pores, which may provide a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures with less energy consumption.</dc:description>

Chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions between a chalcogen atom and the &#960;&#8208;electron cloud can drive a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction efficiently. A simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.







Abstract
While the presence of sulfur&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction is a general phenomenon in the biological systems, the exploitation of this noncovalent force in a chemical process yet remains elusive. Herein, we describe the concept of chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis that activates molecules of &#960; systems through the interaction between chalcogen and &#960;&#8208;electron cloud. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies using a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction demonstrate that S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction can drive the cycloaddition reaction efficiently. Experimental results suggest that a simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture and Reduction to High&#8208;End Chemicals with Tetraalkylammonium Borohydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct CO2 capture and reduction with tetraalkylammonium borohydride is reported. A phase transition from solid to liquid occurs during the absorption, making the product ready to use for HCOOH synthesis or N&#8208;formylation reactions.







Abstract
We demonstrate the ability of tetraalkylammonium borohydrides to capture large amounts of CO2, even at low CO2 concentrations, and reduce it to formate under ambient conditions. These materials show CO2 absorption capacities up to 30&#8197;mmol
&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar CO2. Every BH4&#8722; anion can react with three CO2 molecules to form triformatoborohydride ([HB(OCHO)3]&#8722;). The thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction were monitored by a magnetic suspension balance (MSB). Direct CO2 capture and reduction from air was achieved with tetraethyl, &#8208;propyl, and &#8208;butylammonium borohydride. The alkyl chain length played an important role in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction, especially in CO2 diffusivity (crystallinity and free&#8208;volume), activation energy (charge&#8208;transfer dependent on the alkyl chain), and hydrophobicity. Adding HCl gave formic acid and the corresponding chloride ammonium salt, which can be recycled. In addition, transfer of formate was achieved for the N&#8208;formylation of an amine.

         <title>AIE&#8208;Active Chiral [3]Rotaxanes with Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage of a switchable rotaxane and an AIEgen gave rise to the successful construction of a novel chiral [3]rotaxane&#8208;based CPL switching system with large glum values, remarkable difference in the glum values, and excellent cycling ability.







Abstract
The construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum) has attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications in diverse fields such as the development of smart devices and sensors. Herein, a new family of AIE&#8208;active chiral [3]rotaxanes were designed and synthesized, from which a novel CPL switching system was successfully constructed. The switching process was realized through the controlled motions of the chiral pillar[5]arene macrocycles along the axle through the addition or removal of the acetate anions, which not only modulated the chirality information transfer but also tuned the aggregations of the integrated [3]rotaxanes, thus resulting in reversible transformations between two emission states with both high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and high dissymmetry factors (glum) values.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Activities for CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO Conversion on Fe2O3/MoO3: Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo Covalency Dominates the Intrinsic Activity</title>

         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;Scheme Fe2O3/MoO3 hollow nanotube with a CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO selectivity of 95.7&#8201;% was developed. The thin&#8208;walled hollow structure facilitates a fast transfer of photogenerated carriers and enhances light utilization. The Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channel and internal electric field in the Fe2O3/MoO3 interface improve the charge transfer efficiency. PEC experiments and calculations demonstrate that C&#8722;H bond breaking is the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The catalytic conversion of alcohols under mild conditions is a great challenge because it is constrained by low selectivity and low activity. Herein, we demonstrate a hollow nanotube Fe2O3/MoO3 heterojunction (FeMo&#8208;2) for the photoelectrocatalytic conversion of small&#8208;molecule alcohols. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the optical carrier transfer rate is enhanced by constructing interfacial internal electric fields and Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channels. For the formox process, heterojunctions possess superior HCHO&#8208;selective reaction paths and free energy transitions, optimizing the selectivity of HCHO and enhancing the reactivity. FeMo&#8208;2 shows a greatly improved performance compared to single Fe2O3; the photocurrent density of FeMo&#8208;2 reaches 0.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 3.88&#8197;times that of Fe2O3 (0.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the Faraday efficiency of the CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion is 95.7&#8201;%. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and has potential for the production of HCHO and for conversion reactions of other small&#8208;molecule alcohols at cryogenic temperatures.

         <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 coupled with finite element simulation, we reveal strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox reaction is sluggish at low SOC, but increases rapidly as SOC increases. The kinetic limitation at low SOC can be alleviated through interaction with polycrystals integrated into the same electrode.







Abstract
High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the ionic transport and kinetic properties. We report here a quantitative assessment of redox reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox is sluggish at low SOC but increases rapidly as SOC increases, both in bulk electrodes and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode.

         <title>Enantioselective Alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Gold(I)&#8208;Cavitands: Total Synthesis of Mafaicheenamine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes was designed and applied to the development of the first enantioselective alkoxycyclization of phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes, giving high enantioselectivities and excellent yields. This approach was used for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C. The cavity effect was studied theoretically supporting the high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes have been developed for the enantioselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This enantioselective cyclization has been applied for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C and its enantiomer, establishing its configuration as&#8197;R. The cavity effect was also evaluated in the cycloisomerization of dienynes. A combination of experiments and theoretical studies demonstrates that the cavity of the gold(I) complexes forces the enynes to adopt constrained conformations, which results in the high observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

         <title>Rechargeable K&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a KSn Anode and a Carboxyl&#8208;Containing Carbon Nanotube Cathode Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable K&#8208;CO2 batteries successfully fabricated with a KSn anode and a carboxyl&#8208;containing carbon nanotube cathode catalyst exhibit superior cycling stability and good rate performance because of the strong electrostatic interaction between the cathode catalyst and K2CO3, along with a dendrite&#8208;free anode with high stability. Moreover, the redox mechanism has been verified as 4&#8201;KSn + 3&#8201;CO2 &#8644; 2&#8201;K2CO3 + C + 4&#8201;Sn.







Abstract
Metal K&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from large polarization and safety hazards, which mainly result from the difficult decomposition of K2CO3 and dendrite growth. Moreover, the battery redox mechanism remains not fully understood. Here we report K&#8208;CO2 batteries with KSn alloy as the anode and carboxyl&#8208;containing multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs&#8208;COOH) as the cathode catalyst, proving the redox mechanism to be 4&#8201;KSn + 3&#8201;CO2 &#8644; 2&#8201;K2CO3 + C + 4&#8201;Sn. Compared with K metal, the less active and dendrite&#8208;free KSn anode effectively enhances the safety and stability of CO2 batteries. More importantly, the strong electrostatic interaction between MWCNTs&#8208;COOH and K2CO3 weakens the C=O bond in K2CO3 and thus facilitates K2CO3 decomposition. As a result, the K&#8208;CO2 batteries show excellent cycling stability (an overpotential increase of 0.89&#8197;V after 400&#8197;cycles) and good rate performance (up to 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work paves a way to develop highly stable and safe CO2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Metal Sub&#8208;nanoclusters Confined within Hierarchical Porous Carbons with High Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and versatile strategy has been developed for the synthesis of bimetal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). The sizes of the homogeneous&#8208;dispersion Cu&#8208;M SNCs (M=Pd, Pt, or Ru) are mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm even at high loadings up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;M@HPC catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the selective oxidation of furfural to maleic acid under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8&#8201;% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1&#8197;h&#8722;1 under mild conditions. DFT calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;A novel and versatile strategy has been developed for the synthesis of bimetal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). The sizes of the homogeneous&#8208;dispersion Cu&#8208;M SNCs (M=Pd, Pt, or Ru) are mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm even at high loadings up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;M@HPC catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the selective oxidation of furfural to maleic acid under mild reaction conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8&#8201;% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under mild conditions. DFT calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exploring a Fatigue&#8208;Free Layered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric for Photovoltaic Non&#8208;Volatile Memories</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7, is demonstrated for exploration of photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
Through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7 (BCPB) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 6.5&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high Curie temperature up to 425&#8197;K. Meanwhile, BCPB shows splendid bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;105); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO3. The unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of Ps and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 108 polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of BCPB in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. This work offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Copper&#8211;Arylacetylide Polymerization and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a copper&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibiting the characteristics of mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, and fast polymerization rate is presented. DFT calculations show that the polymerization is a thermodynamically favorable process. The resulting polymers exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties.







Abstract
Exploration of new polymerization reactions is very intriguing in fundamental and practical research, which will advance reaction theories and produce various functional materials. Herein, we report a new polymerization method based on the reaction of CuI and arylacetylide, which generates linear polymers with high molecular weight and low polydispersity index of molecular weight. The Cu&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibits different characteristics with traditional polymerizations such as mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, fast polymerization rate, and imprecise molar ratio between monomers. The bond formation path and activation energy of each step was investigated by density functional theory calculations to understand the reaction mechanism. The poly(Cu&#8208;arylacetylide)s exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties, which have been used to fabricate an electronic device for streptavidin sensing.

         <title>Ultrabright Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles Based on Small&#8208;Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrabright nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared in a simple one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly approach by nanoprecipitation of fluorescent rhodamine dye with a macrocyclic anion receptor. Binding of the dye's counterion by the cyanostar macrocycle ensures separation of dye molecules to prohibit self&#8208;quenching while also acting as a UV antenna system to boost particle fluorescence. Glycol&#8208;stabilized NPs are used for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) hold great promise for demanding bioimaging applications. Recently, extremely bright molecular crystals of cationic fluorophores were obtained by hierarchical coassembly with cyanostar anion&#8208;receptor complexes. These small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) ensure spatial and electronic isolation to prohibit aggregation quenching of dyes. We report a simple, one&#8208;step supramolecular approach to formulate SMILES materials into NPs. Rhodamine&#8208;based SMILES NPs stabilized by glycol amphiphiles show high fluorescence quantum yield (30&#8201;%) and brightness per volume (5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1/nm3) with 400 dye molecules packed into 16&#8208;nm particles, corresponding to a particle absorption coefficient of 4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. UV excitation of the cyanostar component leads to higher brightness (&gt;6000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1/ nm3) by energy transfer to rhodamine emitters. Coated NPs stain cells and are thus promising for bioimaging.

         <title>Bright Long&#8208;Lived Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Chromium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of chiral CrIII chromophores with dual circularly polarized emission within the NIR has been synthesized and characterized. The rational design of the ligand skeleton on chiral CrIII complexes improves the chiral resolution as well as the CPL brightness. These optimized chiral chromophores based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are promising candidates for the emerging chiral technologies.







Abstract
A series of highly emissive inert and chiral CrIII complexes displaying dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) within the NIR region have been prepared and characterized. The helical [Cr(dqpR)2]3+ (dqp=2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)pyridine; R=OCH3, Br or C&#8801;CH) complexes were synthesized as racemic mixtures and resolved into their respective PP and MM enantiomers by chiral stationary phase HPLC. The corresponding enantiomers show large glum&#8776;0.2 and high quantum yield of up to 17&#8201;%, which afford important CPL brightness of up to 170&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, a key point for applications as chiral luminescent probes. Moreover, the long&#8208;lived CP&#8208;NIR emission provided by these chromophores (ms range) in aqueous solution opens the way toward the quantification of chiral targets in biological systems with time&#8208;gated detection. Thus, such chiral chromophores based on earth abundant and inert 3d metals open new perspectives in the field of CPL and represent an alternative to precious 4d, 5d and to labile 4f metal&#8208;based complexes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Haliclonin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of a tetracyclic natural product, haliclonin A, was achieved. The cyclohexane ring was derived from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, which was elaborated via Birch reduction, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and a reaction with an organocopper reagent. The lactam ring was constructed via reductive C&#8722;N bond formation. The two macrocyclic rings were formed via ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
The total synthesis of haliclonin&#8197;A was accomplished. Starting from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, a functionalized cyclohexanone fused to a 17&#8208;membered ring was prepared through a Birch reduction/alkylation sequence, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition of an organocopper reagent to an enone moiety. Reductive C&#8722;N bond formation via an N,O&#8208;acetal forged the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. The allyl alcohol moiety was constructed by a sequence involving stereoselective &#945;&#8208;selenylation of an aldehyde via an enamine, syn&#8208;elimination of a selenoxide, and allylation of the aldehyde with an allylboronate. Formation of the 15&#8208;membered ring containing a skipped diene was achieved by ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and final transformations led to the synthesis of haliclonin&#8197;A.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron&#8208;Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viologen&#8208;derived electron&#8208;transfer mediators (ETMs) are integrated into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) by a controllable post&#8208;synthetic method. The site&#8208;isolated ETM modules cooperate well with photosensitizer modules on the platform of COFs for enhanced electron&#8208;transfer ability, thereby remarkably promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (34600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) from water splitting.







Abstract
Electron transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron&#8208;transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of a stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.

         <title>A TADF Emitter Featuring Linearly Arranged Spiro&#8208;Donor and Spiro&#8208;Acceptor Groups: Efficient Nondoped and Doped Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with CIEy &lt;0.1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining a weak spiro&#8208;donor and a weak spiro&#8208;acceptor through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer, a linear D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type of TADF compound is constructed. Highly efficient nondoped (EQEmax: 22.5&#8201;%) and doped (EQEmax: 25.4&#8201;%) deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIEy of less than 0.1 are realized based on the compound. The nondoped OLED represents the most efficient one achieved so far on the premise of a CIEy of less than 0.1.







Abstract
Reported herein is a molecular design strategy of deep&#8208;blue emitters for resolving the lack of highly efficient deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring CIEy (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) color coordinates matching the display requirements (&lt;0.1). The strategy is to combine weak spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups into a linear donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type of thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence molecule through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer. The strategy endows an emitter with deep&#8208;blue emission, a narrower emission bandwidth (51&#8197;nm in toluene), a high photoluminescence quantum yield (0.95 in toluene), weak concentration quenching, and efficient triplet&#8208;exciton utilization, which are all attractive characteristics for emitters of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with lower CIEy coordinates. Owing to the rational design, the emitter has realized not only highly efficient doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 25.4&#8201;% and CIEy less than 0.1 but also so far the most efficient nondoped deep&#8208;blue OLED (EQE up to 22.5&#8201;%) with CIEy less than 0.1.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Tumor Therapy via Integrated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese single&#8208;atom enzyme (Mn/PSAE) was synthesized, which can efficiently catalyze the concurrent generation of .OH and .O2&#8722; in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, amorphous carbon&#8208;based Mn/PSAE has excellent NIR&#8208;photothermal performance, which makes it possible to combine the multi&#8208;catalytic and photothermal&#8208;enhanced tumor therapy.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom enzyme (SAE) is a novel type of nanozyme that exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity. Here, we constructed a PEGylated manganese&#8208;based SAE (Mn/PSAE) by coordination of single&#8208;atom manganese to nitrogen atoms in hollow zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Mn/PSAE catalyzes the conversion of cellular H2O2 to .OH through a Fenton&#8208;like reaction; it also promotes the decomposition of H2O2 to O2 and continuously catalyzes the conversion of O2 to cytotoxic .O2&#8722; via oxidase&#8208;like activity. The catalytic activity of Mn/PSAE is more pronounced in the weak acidic tumor environment; therefore, these cascade reactions enable the sufficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effectively kill tumor cells. The prominent photothermal conversion property of the amorphous carbon can be utilized for photothermal therapy. Hence, Mn/PSAE exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy through tumor microenvironment stimulated generation of multiple ROS and photothermal activity.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;fueled self&#8208;assembly in biology and chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high&#8208;energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified based on a distinguishable physical&#8208;organic basis. These classes are presented in an order of increasing complexity ranging from thermodynamically controlled templated self&#8208;assembly to the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;organization of high&#8208;energy assemblies. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities offered by each of them.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high&#8208;energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified based on a distinguishable physical&#8208;organic basis. These classes are presented in an order of increasing complexity ranging from thermodynamically controlled templated self&#8208;assembly to the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;organization of high&#8208;energy assemblies. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities offered by each of them.

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Single Layer Graphene/Electrolyte Interface: Effect of Solvent on the Interfacial Capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge of the double layer capacitance at a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode was studied in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface.







Abstract
The development of the basic understanding of the charge storage mechanisms in electrodes for energy storage applications needs deep characterization of the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, we studied the charge of the double layer capacitance at single layer graphene (SLG) electrode used as a model material, in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. The combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface. The capacitance is thus governed not only by the electronic properties of the graphene, but also by the specific organization of the electrolyte side at the SLG surface originating from the strong interactions existing between the EMIm+ cations and SLG surface. EQCM measurements also show that the carbon structure, with the presence of sp2 carbons, affects the charge storage mechanism by favoring counter&#8208;ion adsorption on SLG electrode versus ion exchange mechanism in amorphous porous carbons.

Amphiphilic TRL7/8 agonist adjuvanted recombinant Spike protein vaccine protects against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in mouse models.







Abstract
The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality because of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Here we describe an amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ&#8208;PEG&#8208;CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile. It is water&#8208;soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration through binding to albumin, affording localized innate immune activation and reduction in systemic inflammation. The adjuvanticity of IMDQ&#8208;PEG&#8208;CHOL was validated in a licensed vaccine setting (quadrivalent influenza vaccine) and an experimental trimeric recombinant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein vaccine, showing robust IgG2a and IgG1 antibody titers in mice that could neutralize viral infection in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Plasmodium falciparum Proteasome Inhibitor with Anti&#8208;malaria Activity in Humanized Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pf20S inhibitors possess the potential to be therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission&#8208;blocking antimalarials. We present a novel and highly species&#8208;selective malaria proteasome inhibitor that potently reduced parasitemia in humanized mice infected with P. falciparum, the deadliest plasmodium parasite.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum proteasome (Pf20S) inhibitors are active against Plasmodium at multiple stages&#8212;erythrocytic, gametocyte, liver, and gamete activation stages&#8212;indicating that selective Pf20S inhibitors possess the potential to be therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission&#8208;blocking antimalarials. Starting from a reported compound, we developed a noncovalent, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of the malarial proteasome with high species selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties. The compound demonstrates specific, time&#8208;dependent inhibition of the &#946;5 subunit of the Pf20S, kills artemisinin&#8208;sensitive and artemisinin&#8208;resistant P.&#8197;falciparum isolates in&#8197;vitro and reduces parasitemia in humanized, P.&#8197;falciparum&#8208;infected mice.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metallic nanocube ensembles exhibit tunable localized surface plasmon resonance to induce the light manipulation at the subwavelength scale. Nevertheless, precisely control anisotropic metallic nanocube ensembles with relative spatial directionality remains a challenge. Here, we report a DNA origami based nanoprinting (DOBNP) strategy to transfer the essential DNA strands with predefined sequences and positions to the surface of the gold nanocubes (AuNCs). These DNA strands ensured the specific linkages between AuNCs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that generating the stereo&#8208;controlled AuNC&#8208;AuNP nanostructures (AANs) with controlled geometry and composition. By anchoring the single dye molecule in hot spot regions, the dramatic enhanced electromagnetic field aroused stronger surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal amplification. Our approach opens the opportunity for the fabrication of stereo&#8208;controlled metal nanostructures for designing high sensitive photonic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>&#951;3&#8208;Coordination and Functionalization of the 2&#8208;Phosphaethynthiolate Anion at Lanthanum(III)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate ([SCP]&#8722;) anion at a Lewis&#8208;acidic lanthanum(III) ion and its subsequent rearrangement to form a substituted heavy &#8220;fulminate&#8208;like&#8221; anion, induced by cyclic alkyl amino carbenes, are reported.







Abstract
We present the &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate anion in the complex (PN)2La(SCP) (2) [PN=N&#8208;(2&#8208;(diisopropylphosphanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylanilide)]. Structural comparison with dinuclear thiocyanate&#8208;bridged (PN)2La(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;SCN)2La(PN)2 (3) and azide&#8208;bridged (PN)2La(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;N3)2La(PN)2 (4) complexes indicates that the [SCP]&#8722; coordination mode is mainly governed by electronic, rather than steric factors. Quantum mechanical investigations reveal large contributions of the antibonding &#960;*&#8208;orbital of the [SCP]&#8722; ligand to the LUMO of complex 2, rendering it the ideal precursor for the first functionalization of the [SCP]&#8722; anion. Complex 2 was therefore reacted with CAACs which induced a selective rearrangement of the [SCP]&#8722; ligand to form the first CAAC stabilized group&#8197;15&#8211;group&#8197;16 fulminate&#8208;type complexes (PN)2La{SPC(RCAAC)} (5&#8201;a,b, R=Ad, Me). A detailed reaction mechanism for the SCP&#8208;to&#8208;SPC isomerization is proposed based on DFT calculations.

         <dc:description>The triphenylmethane and all&#8208;meta tert&#8208;butyl triphenylmethane dimers, (TPM)2 and (TtBuPM)2, respectively, were studied with ionization loss stimulated Raman spectroscopy in molecular beam experiments to resolve structure sensitive vibrations. This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (TtBuPM)2 results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8211;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (TtBuPM)2 associated with an unusually short C&#8211;D&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;D&#8211;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)2, it displays an approximately S6&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Methylation of Alkyl Iodides with CO as the C1 Source: Advantaged by Faster Reaction of CuH over CuBpin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CuH and CuBpin are versatile catalysts and intermediates in organic chemistry. However, studies that involve both CuH and CuBpin in the same reaction is still rarely reported due to their high reactivity. In this communication, an interesting study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source has been reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Non&#8208;innocence and Single Molecular Spintronics Properties of Ag(II) Dibenzocorrole Radical on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile method for the quantitative preparation of silver dibenzo&#8208;fused corrole  Ag&#8208;1  is described. In contrast to the saddle conformation resolved by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis for  Ag&#8208;1  , it adopts an unprecedented domed geometry, with up&#8208; and down&#8208;orientations, when adsorbed on Ag(111) surface. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center, were observed by cryogenic STM, with relatively high Kondo temperature (172 K), providing the first direct spectroscopic evidence for a non&#8208;innocent Ag  II  &#8211;corrole  &#8226;2&#8208;  species. Further investigation validates that benzene ring fusion and molecule&#8211;substrate interactions play pivotal roles in enhancing Ag (4d  x2&#8208;y2  )&#8208;corrole (&#960;) orbital interactions, thereby stabilizing the open&#8208;shell singlet Ag  II  &#8211;corrole  &#8226;2&#8208;  on Ag(111) surface. Moreover, this strategy used for constructing metal&#8208;free benzene&#8208;ring fused corrole ligand gives rise to inspiration of designing novel metal&#8208;corrole compound which could be applied to the research of multichannel molecular spintronics devices for data storage and logic gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scalable Interfacial Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation method is through ultrasonication or solvothermal, which is however difficult to implement the large&#8208;scalable production of MOFs with modulated active sites. Herein, a liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the large&#8208;scalable fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. We demonstrated that the active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (R  M/L  ). Interestingly, the Ni MOF NSs display highly R  M/L  dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ), where the Ni MOF NSs with the R  M/L  of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ~98% H  2  O  2  selectivity and production rate of ~80 mmol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  in 0.1 M KOH, making them promising electrocatalysts for H  2  O  2  synthesis. As evidenced by x&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical metal&#8208;polymer hybrids for enhanced CO2 electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  is an important topic and design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is a key. Herein, we report a strategy to synthesize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hierarchical metal/polymer&#8208;carbon paper (M/polymer&#8208;CP) electrodes by in situ electrosynthesis. In the preparation, 3D polymer layer on CP (polymer&#8208;CP) is first prepared by in situ electro&#8208;polymerization, then 3D metal layer is decorated on the polymer&#8208;CP to obtain the M/polymer&#8208;CP electrode. It was demonstrated that the electrodes with different metals (e.g. Cu, Pd, Zn, Sn) and various polymers, such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene and their co&#8208;polymers, could be prepared by this method. The electrodes could efficiently reduce CO  2  to desired products, such as C  2  H  4  , CO and HCOOH, depending on the metal used. For example, a C  2  H  4  Faradaic efficiency of 59.4% with a current density of 30.2 mA cm  &#8208;2  could be achieved using Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell, and the electrode was very stable. Control experiments and theoretical calculation showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance. This work provides a new and versatile protocol to design and prepare highly efficient and stable catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction.</dc:description>

For example, a C  2  H  4  Faradaic efficiency of 59.4% with a current density of 30.2 mA cm  &#8208;2  could be achieved using Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell, and the electrode was very stable. Control experiments and theoretical calculation showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance. This work provides a new and versatile protocol to design and prepare highly efficient and stable catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imparting mesopores to organic cages of an intrinsic microporous nature to build up hierarchically porous cage soft materials is a grand challenge and will reshape the property and application scope of traditional organic cage molecules. Herein, we discovered how to engineer mesopores into microporous organic cages via their host&#8208;guest interactions with long chain ionic surfactants. Equally important, the ionic head of surfactants equips the supramolecularly assembled porous structures with charge&#8208;selective uptake and release function in solution. Interestingly, such hierarchically porous organic cage can serve as a nanoreactor once trapping enzymes within the cavity, which show 5&#8208;fold enhanced activity of enzymatic catalysis when compared with the free enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of Reactive Nitrous Acid Formation in Rare Earth MOFs via ab initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Here, an extensive set of  ab initio  molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO  2  and H  2  O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO  2&#160;  without the presence of H  2  O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#8220;Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolytes (WISE) have largely widen the electrochemical stability window (ESW) of aqueous electrolytes by formation of passivating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on anode and also absorption of hydrophobic anion&#8208;rich double layer on cathode. However, the cathodic limiting potential of WISE is still too high for most high capacity anodes in aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs), and the cost of WISE is also too high for practical application. Herein, a low&#8208;cost 19 m (m: mol kg  &#8208;1) bi&#8208;salts WISE with a wide ESW of 2.8 V was designed, where the low&#8208;cost 17 m NaClO4  extends the anodic limiting potential to 4.4 V, while the fluorine&#8208;containing salt (2 m NaOTF) extends the cathodic limiting potential to 1.6 V by forming a NaF&#8208;Na2O&#8208;NaOH SEI on anodes.

         <title>Deliberate construction of polyoxoniobates exploiting the carbonate ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals=V  V  , Nb  V  , Ta  V  , Mo  VI  , W  VI  ) are molecular metal oxides that can be isolated without capping ligands. The high negative charge of polyoxoniobates (PONb) provides strong interactions with heterocations, advantageous for electrostatic assembly of modular materials. In four single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we demonstrate that carbonate combined with the very reactive decaniobate [Nb  10  O  28  ]  6&#8208;  reassembles into a new decaniobate, [Nb  10  O  25  (CO  3  )  6  ]  12&#8208;  , featuring three carbonate&#8208;ligated Nb&#8208;polyhedra. These Nb&#8208;sites can be replaced by heterometals (lanthanides), and the tridentate carbonate can serve as an anchor point to build niobate&#8208;frameworks. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and two additional X&#8208;ray structures reveal the reaction pathway proceeds through a Nb  24  &#8208;PONb intermediate, and the obtained PONb (with or without carbonate) is both temperature and solvent&#8208;dependent (water or mixed water&#8208;methanol). This provides an uncommon level of control for PONb chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides from Glycosyl Esters via C&#8722;O Bond Homolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to synthesize C&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides from glycosyl esters is reported. The reaction is particularly useful for preparing &#946;&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues, leveraging the photoredox activation of dihydropyridine and decarboxylation to homolytically cleave C&#8722;O bonds and afford glycosyl radicals.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosyl compounds offer better in vivo stability relative to O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycoside analogues. C&#8208;aryl glycosides are extensively investigated as drug candidates and applied to chemical biology studies. Previously, C&#8208;aryl glycosides were derived from lactones, glycals, glycosyl stannanes, and halides, via methods displaying various limitations with respect to the scope, functional&#8208;group compatibility, and practicality. Challenges remain in the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars from easily accessible carbohydrate precursors. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;coupling method to prepare C&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides, including nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars, from glycosyl esters and bromoarenes. Activation of the carbohydrate substrates leverages dihydropyridine (DHP) as an activating group followed by decarboxylation to generate a glycosyl radical via C&#8722;O bond homolysis. This strategy represents a new means to activate alcohols as a cross&#8208;coupling partner. The convenient preparation of glycosyl esters and their stability exemplifies the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A method to synthesize &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides from glycosyl esters is reported. The reaction is particularly useful for preparing &#946;&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues, leveraging the photoredox activation of dihydropyridine and decarboxylation to homolytically cleave C&#8722;O bonds and afford glycosyl radicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl glycosyl compounds offer better in vivo stability relative to &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;&#8208; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;glycoside analogues. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl glycosides are extensively investigated as drug candidates and applied to chemical biology studies. Previously, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl glycosides were derived from lactones, glycals, glycosyl stannanes, and halides, via methods displaying various limitations with respect to the scope, functional&#8208;group compatibility, and practicality. Challenges remain in the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars from easily accessible carbohydrate precursors. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;coupling method to prepare &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides, including nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars, from glycosyl esters and bromoarenes. Activation of the carbohydrate substrates leverages dihydropyridine (DHP) as an activating group followed by decarboxylation to generate a glycosyl radical via C&#8722;O bond homolysis. This strategy represents a new means to activate alcohols as a cross&#8208;coupling partner. The convenient preparation of glycosyl esters and their stability exemplifies the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity at Room Temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics.







Abstract
Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Herein, the crystal structure and transport properties of Cu4TiSe4 are reported. Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity (kL) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu, which partially hybridize with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoidance of crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reach the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu4TiSe4 could also open a route to efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, provided that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.

         <title>Unprecedented Reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Amino Cyclopentenone Enables Diversity&#8208;Oriented Access to Functionalized Indoles and Indole&#8208;Annulated Ring Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights diversity&#8208;oriented access to cyclopentenoid indoles and indole&#8208;alkaloid like structures which is pillared on an unprecedented latent reactivity of &#947;&#8208;aminoenones. The transformation highlights &#947;&#8208; or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;functionalization of enones to generate new structural space. A reverse&#8208;aza&#8208;Piancatelli rearrangement seemed to be operating, which should invoke new attributes to its mechanism.







Abstract
Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/N&#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and selectivity through a one&#8208;pot operation. The mechanism most likely involves an unprecedented trait of Piancatelli&#8208;type rearrangement where influence of the gem&#8208;diaryl group appeared crucial.

A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes with high enantioselectivity is achieved by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex. This afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles.







Abstract
A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes that realizes over 90&#8201;% ee is the ultimate challenge in alkylnitrile addition chemistry. Herein, we report achieving high enantioselectivity by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex, which afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles. This highly atom&#8208;economical process paves the way for exploiting inexpensive acetonitrile as a promising C2 building block in a practical synthetic toolbox for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and reversible 1&#8208;dimensional DNA nanostructure, assembled from DNA triplexes and G&#8208;quadruplexes, is reported. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; nanostructures require potassium ions and acidic pH to form and are easily disassembled by removal of either requirement. We anticipate that they will find unique and varied application as communication modules, sensors, logic gates, and in diverse other uses of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQs tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt;150&#8197;nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Selectively Upgrading Lignin Derivatives to Carboxylates through Electrochemical Oxidative C(OH)&#8722;C Bond Cleavage by a Mn&#8208;Doped Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical strategy has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds using a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide catalyst under mild conditions. Preliminary studies demonstrate its application in upgrading lignin&#8208;derived products with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, electrorefining them into valuable oxygenates, such as benzoate and adipate.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8211;99&#8201;%) and operational stability (200&#8197;h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from the electrolyte converts secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach was applied to upgrade lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5&#8201;% and 64.2&#8201;% yields, respectively.

Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8211;99&#8201;%) and operational stability (200&#8197;h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from the electrolyte converts secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach was applied to upgrade lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5&#8201;% and 64.2&#8201;% yields, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+&#8197;Products at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#8208;Cu gas diffusion electrode (GDE) system was developed for highly selective CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at high relevant current densities by mitigating the flooding problem and tuning the three&#8208;phase boundary. Anodic protection by sacrificial Zn&#8197;nanosheets remarkably improved the long&#8208;term stability for CO2 electroreduction at high current densities.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stability under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were developed for highly selective and stable CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79&#8201;% for C2+&#8197;products formation at a current density of &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a potential of &#8722;0.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C2+ formation was substantially improved by incorporating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu+ species under CO2 reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which lead to the excellent conversion of CO2 to C2+ products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.

         <title>Cephalodiones A&#8211;D: Compound Characterization and Semisynthesis by [6+6] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical study on a Cephalotaxus plant led to the characterization of four unprecedented C19&#8208;norditerpenoid dimers, named cephalodiones A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4). These compounds were proposed to be biosynthetically formed through [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two C19&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids either C2&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically, which was validated by the semisyntheses of 2&#8211;4. Some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.







Abstract
Cephalodiones A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), the first example of C19&#8208;norditerpenoid dimers, were isolated and fully characterized from a Cephalotaxus plant. These new skeletal natural products shared a unique tricyclo[6.4.1.12,7]tetradeca&#8208;3,5,9,11&#8208;tetraene&#8208;13,14&#8208;dione core that was capped in both ends with rigid multicyclic ring systems either C2&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically. Compounds 1&#8211;4 were proposed to be biosynthetically produced by the [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two identical C19&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids, which was validated by the semisyntheses of dimers 2&#8211;4. Moreover, some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Palladium Metallene for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin porous Pd metallene with rich nanocrystal defects were prepared by a one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method for superior oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes.







Abstract
Metallene with fantastic physicochemical properties is considered as a potential candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Controlling the morphology and structure of metallene can provide a great opportunity to improve its catalytic performance. Herein, defect&#8208;rich ultrathin porous Pd metallene (a sub&#8208;nanometer and curved metal nanosheet) is developed by facile wet&#8208;chemistry strategy for efficient and stable ORR electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. The defect&#8208;rich porous Pd metallene provides abundant highly active sites and vacancy defects, showing superior ORR activity of 0.892&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. The mass activity is 5.1 and 16.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, and maintains well after 5000&#8197;cycles. The strain effect and tunable electronic structure derived from highly curved sub&#8208;nanometer nanosheet morphology contribute to the excellent ORR performance by the optimization of oxygen binding ability on Pd. The superior catalytic performance of Pd metallene may open an avenue to design other metallene materials for various fields.

         <title>s&#8208;Block Multiple Bonds: Isolation of a Beryllium Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first s&#8208;block metal&#8208;nitrogen double bond is synthesized! The shortest beryllium&#8208;nitrogen bond has been prepared via oxidation of Be0.







Abstract
A common feature of d&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements is that they participate in multiple bonding. In contrast, the synthesis of compounds containing homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;nuclear multiple bonds involving s&#8208;block elements is extremely rare. Herein, we report the synthesis, molecular structure, and computational analysis of a beryllium imido (Be=N) complex (2), which was prepared via oxidation of a molecular Be0 precursor (1) with trimethylsilyl azide Me3SiN3 (TMS&#8208;N3). Notably, compound 2 features the shortest known Be=N bond (1.464&#8197;&#197;) to date. This represents the first compound with an s&#8208;block metal&#8208;nitrogen multiple bond. All compounds were characterized experimentally with multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 9Be) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The bonding situation was analyzed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which supports the existence of &#960;&#8208;bonding between beryllium and nitrogen.

         <title>Nanospace Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through Dynamic Spacer Installation of Multifunctionalities for Efficient Separation of Ethane from Ethane/Ethylene Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been developed to realize a series of multifunctional metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs) with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. The installation of functional spacers into the proto&#8208;LIFM&#8208;28 not only improves the pore volume, but also reduces the pore size, leading to enhanced C2H6/C2H4 separation performance.







Abstract
Herein, a dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been implemented to construct a series of multifunctional metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), LIFM&#8208;61/31/62/63, with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. In this respect, a series of linear dicarboxylic acids were deliberately installed in the prototype MOF, LIFM&#8208;28, leading to a dramatically increased pore volume (from 0.41 to 0.82&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and reduced pore size (from 11.1&#215;11.1&#8197;&#197;2 to 5.6&#215;5.6&#8197;&#197;2). The increased pore volume endows the multifunctional MOFs with much higher ethane adsorption capacity, especially for LIFM&#8208;63 (4.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), representing nearly three times as much ethane as the prototypical counterpart (1.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Meanwhile, the reduced pore size imparts enhanced ethane/ethylene selectivity of the multifunctional MOFs. Theoretical calculations and dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the DSI is a promising approach for the rational design of multifunctional MOFs for this challenging task.

         <title>Boosting the Electrocatalysis of MXenes by Plasmon&#8208;Induced Thermalization and Hot&#8208;Electron Injection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic activity of MXenes can be boosted by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The resulting intense photothermal effect and hot&#8208;electron injection reduces the endothermic enthalpy, activation energy, and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the hydrogen evolution reaction on various types of MXenes over a broad pH range.







Abstract
The MXenes attract great interest in catalytic and energy applications but suffer from inferior redox activity. An efficient strategy is presented to boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity of MXenes for electrocatalysis in various chemical environments by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The resulting significant thermoplasmonic effect lowers the endothermic enthalpy and potential barrier to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the Vis/near&#8208;IR region. Simultaneous hot&#8208;electron injection in a prolonged sub&#8208;femtosecond to picosecond timescale also remarkably facilitates interfacial charge transfer and decreases the activation energy of the reaction. Both effects boost the HER activity of various types of MXenes over fivefold with improved kinetics and Faradaic efficiency over a broad pH range.

         <title>Engineering the Bandgap and Surface Structure of CsPbCl3 Nanocrystals to Achieve Efficient Ultraviolet Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV&#8208;emitting halide perovskites are designed by doping Cd2+ into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals to broaden their band gap with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm. Upon treatment with CdCl2, a UV photoluminescence quantum yield up to 60.5&#8201;% can be achieved. Transient absorption spectra and first&#8208;principle calculations confirm that the significantly improved optical performance benefits primarily from the marked elimination of surface traps such as a Cl vacancy.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design of novel ultraviolet luminescent CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (NCs) with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm through doping of cadmium ions. Subsequently, a surface passivation strategy with CdCl2 is adopted to improve their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with the maximum value of 60.5&#8201;%, which is 67 times higher than that of the pristine counterparts. The PLQY of the surface passivated NCs remains over 50&#8201;% after one week while the pristine NCs show negligible emission. By virtue of density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the higher PLQY and better stability after surface passivation may result from the significant elimination of surface chloride vacancy (VCl) defects. These findings provide fundamental insights into the optical manipulation of metal ion&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 NCs.

         <title>Formation and Characterization of BeFe(CO)4&#8722; Anion with Beryllium&#8722;Iron Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteronuclear BeFe(CO)4&#8722; anion complex is generated in the gas phase, which is characterized to have a quite short Be&#8722;Fe bonded C3v structure. The findings imply that metal&#8211;metal bonding between s&#8208;block and transition metals is viable under suitable coordination environment.







Abstract
Heteronuclear BeFe(CO)4&#8722; anion complex is generated in the gas phase, which is detected by mass&#8208;selected infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in the carbonyl stretching frequency region. The complex is characterized to have a Be&#8722;Fe bonded Be&#8722;Fe(CO)4&#8722; structure with C3v symmetry and all of the four carbonyl ligands bonded on the iron center. Quantum chemical studies indicate that the complex has a quite short Be&#8722;Fe bond. Besides one electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two additional, albeit weak, Be &#8592; Fe(CO)4&#8722; dative &#960; bonding interactions. The findings imply that metal&#8211;metal bonding between s&#8208;block and transition metals is viable under suitable coordination environment.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Lewis Acid Sites in Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Monoliths to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation at Reduced Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous single&#8208;crystalline molybdenum nitride monoliths can be grown with a high density of Lewis acid sites at the well&#8208;defined surface. This porous material shows enhanced non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at reduced temperatures.







Abstract
The non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene plays an important role in the light&#8208;olefin chemical industry. However, the conversion and selectivity remain a fundamental challenge at low temperatures. Here we create and engineer high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at well&#8208;defined surfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo2N and MoN monoliths to enhance the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The top&#8208;layer Mo ions with unsaturated Mo&#8208;N1/6 and Mo&#8208;N1/3 coordination structures provide high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at the surface, leading to the effective activation of C&#8722;H bonds without the overcracking of C&#8722;C bonds during the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. We demonstrate a propane conversion of &#8776;11&#8201;% and a propylene selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% with porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo2N and MoN monoliths at 500&#8201;&#176;C.

The concept of the electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is an intrinsically sustainable strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources to transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. This Review describes the concept, fundamentals, and framework of e&#8208;refinery processes with some game&#8208;changing reactions and innovative catalyst design strategies.







Abstract
Compared to modern fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based refineries, the emerging electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is a more sustainable and environmentally benign strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources into transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. A crucial step in conducting e&#8208;refinery processes is the development of appropriate reactions and optimal electrocatalysts for efficient cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. However, compared to well&#8208;studied primary reactions (e.g., O2 reduction, water splitting), the mechanistic aspects and materials design for emerging complex reactions are yet to be settled. To address this challenge, herein, we first present fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these to establish the framework of e&#8208;refinery by coupling in situ generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways.

         <title>Stabilization of Polynitrogen Anions in Tantalum&#8211;Nitrogen Compounds at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct reaction between nitrogen and tantalum at approximately 100&#8197;GPa results in the energetic nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds TaN4 and TaN5, which feature N4 chains and unprecedented branched single&#8208;bonded polymeric nitrogen chains in the crystal structures, respectively. TaN5 possesses an extraordinary volumetric energy density of 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, exceeding well&#8208;known high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.







Abstract
The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8722;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN5 via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at circa 100&#8197;GPa. TaN5 is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N55&#8722;]&#8734;. Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8211;N compounds: TaN4 with finite N44&#8722; chains and the incommensurately modulated compound TaN2&#8722;x, which is recoverable at ambient conditions.

         <title>Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an aptamer blocking strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With the advantages of small size, rapid kinetics, high stability, sophisticated programmability and high security, our aptamers have great potential as prophylactic and therapeutic agents, which could greatly assist in the intervention of prevailing and emerging infectious diseases other than COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein (SRBD) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid these limitations, we demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers&#8217; binding to the region on SRBD that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With aptamer selection against SRBD and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2&#8208;6 was identified and applied to prevent, compete with, and substitute ACE2 from binding to SRBD. CoV2&#8208;6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent aptamer CoV2&#8208;6C3 (cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 is stable in serum for more than 12&#8197;h and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14&#8197;days. Furthermore, cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 binds to SRBD with high affinity (Kd=0.13&#8197;nM) and blocks authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with an IC50 of 0.42&#8197;nM.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Spring&#8208;Like Motion of an Anion&#8208;Based Triple Helicate by Tetraalkylammonium Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven triple helicate molecular spring undergoes reversible extension&#8208;contraction motion by addition/removal of tetraalkylammonium guest cations, which is accompanied by an &#8220;orientational&#8221; isomerization (i.e. rotation of an anion) of the helicate to facilitate guest binding. The spring&#8208;like motion is modulated by both the size and shape of the cationic guest.







Abstract
Supramolecular springs are a class of molecular devices that may provide implications to the macroscopic spring behavior from the molecular level. Helical structures are suitable molecular springs because the specific twisting of the helical strands can cause spring&#8208;like (extension&#8208;contraction) movement along the axis upon external stimuli. Herein we report an anion&#8208;based triple&#8208;helicate spring, which can undergo reversible contraction&#8211;extension motion through introduction and removal of tetraalkylammonium cations, including TMA+ and analogous irregular tetrahedral cations bearing different alkyl chains, while the relative orientation of the two phosphate ions changes to facilitate guest inclusion. Notably, the degree of contraction (shortening of the helical pitch) can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the shape and size of guest cation. However, with the larger cations (TEA+, TPA+ and TBA+), the meso&#8208;helicate configuration is obtained, which interconverts with the helicate by addition/removal of TMA+ ion.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As enabled by the compact pore space and the complementary electrostatic potential fitting for CO2 molecules, ultramicroporous cadmium nitroprusside showed molecular quadrupole moment recognition towards CO2 over C2H2 (see picture) with a high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio of 6.0 and CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 85. Dynamic breakthrough experiments validated the potential of this compound for CO2/C2H2 separation.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging owing to their similar physical properties and molecular dimensions. Herein, we report highly efficient electrostatically driven CO2/C2H2 separation in an ultramicroporous cadmium nitroprusside (Cd&#8208;NP) with compact pore space and complementary electrostatic potential well fitting for CO2, thus enabling molecular quadrupole moment recognition of CO2 over C2H2. This material shows a high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio of 6.0 as well as remarkable CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 85 under ambient conditions with modest CO2 heat of adsorption. Neutron powder diffraction experiments and molecular simulations revealed that the electrostatic potential compatibility between pore structure and CO2 allows it to be trapped in a head&#8208;on orientation towards the Cd center, whereas the diffusion of C2H2 is electrostatically forbidden. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of this compound for CO2/C2H2 separation.

Neutron powder diffraction experiments and molecular simulations revealed that the electrostatic potential compatibility between pore structure and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows it to be trapped in a head&#8208;on orientation towards the Cd center, whereas the diffusion of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is electrostatically forbidden. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of this compound for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Desymmetrization of Prochiral Cyclobutanones via Nitrogen Insertion: A Concise Route to Chiral &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1S,2R)&#8208;2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1&#8208;indanol was identified as a chiral nitrogen source in an oxidative rearrangement of prochiral cyclobutanones. Building on strain release as the driving force, this downstream stereoinduction enables a variety of &#947;&#8208;lactams to be synthesized including those bearing quaternary stereocenters. In addition, drug molecules pregabalin, baclofen, and brivaracetam are accessible, which underlines the broad applicability of this method.







Abstract
Asymmetric access to &#947;&#8208;lactams is achieved via a cyclobutanone ring expansion using widely available (1S,2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;indanol for chiral induction. Mechanistic analysis of the key N,O&#8208;ketal rearrangement reveals a Curtin&#8211;Hammett scenario, which enables a downstream stereoinduction (up to 88:12&#8197;dr) and is corroborated by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies. In combination with an easy deprotection protocol, this operationally simple sequence allows the synthesis of a range of optically pure &#947;&#8208;lactams, including those bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. In addition, the formal synthesis of drug molecules baclofen, brivaracetam, and pregabalin further demonstrates the synthetic utility and highlights the general applicability of the presented method.

         <title>Tunable Hollow Nanoreactors for In&#8208;situ Synthesis of GeP Electrode towards High Performance Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of germanium phosphide (GeP)&#160;in battery systems is seriously impeded referring to the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe volume change. Nanostructure design that elaborately resolves the above issues is highly&#160;desired but still remains a big challenge. Herein, unique hollow nanoreactors assembled with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon networks for in&#8208;situ synthesis of the GeP electrode are proposed for the first time. Such nanoreactors form a self&#8208;supported conductive network, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport. Moreover, they restrain the crystal growth and accommodate the volume expansion of GeP simultaneously. Reaction kinetics and confinement effect are further optimized through nanoreactors size regulation.&#160;These synergistic effects endow the optimized GeP electrode with high reversible capacities, outstanding cyclability and rate performance for sodium storage, outperforming most previously reported phosphides. This work highlights a highly effective and facile approach that advances the performance of GeP closer towards practical applications for energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>An Exemplary Gay Scientist and Mentor: Martin Gouterman (1931&#8211;2020)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Martin Gouterman was an iconic figure of porphyrin science. Using his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model, he accomplished a grand optical taxonomy of porphyrin derivatives. He devoted the latter part of his career to devise pressure&#8208;sensitive paints, which are now widely used by the aerospace industry. A gay man, he helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group. In death, he remains a beacon for a more humane and inclusive scientific enterprise.







Abstract
Martin Gouterman (1931&#8211;2020) was one of the foundational figures of modern porphyrin science. After completing his Ph.D. at The University of Chicago in 1958, he joined Harvard, where he developed his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model. In 1966, he moved to the University of Washington Seattle (UW). Here he came out as gay and helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group, the Dorian Society. At UW, Gouterman accomplished an &#8220;optical taxonomy&#8221; of the major classes of porphyrin derivatives and pioneered pressure&#8208;sensitive paints based on phosphorescent platinum porphyrins to map the partial pressure of oxygen on airplane wings. Revered by his students and co&#8208;workers for his brilliant yet gentle advising, Gouterman remains a beacon for a more humane and inclusive scientific enterprise.

         <title>Fe/Fe3C Boosts H2O2 Utilization for Methane Conversion Overwhelming O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type FeNx/C catalyst, Fe&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles promote the efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 for the highly selective oxidation of methane to formic acid. The reaction mechanism at the active sites has been studied.







Abstract
H2O2 as a well&#8208;known efficient oxidant is widely used in the chemical industry mainly because of its homolytic cleavage into .OH (stronger oxidant), but this reaction always competes with O2 generation resulting in H2O2 waste. Here, we fabricate heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type Fe&#8208;based catalysts containing Fe&#8208;Nx sites and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;Nx in the low spin state provides the active site for .OH generation. Fe/Fe3C, in particular Fe3C, promotes Fe&#8208;Nx sites for the homolytic cleavages of H2O2 into .OH, but Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe0 as the main component) with more electrons are prone to the undesired O2 generation. With a catalyst benefiting from finely tuned active sites, 18&#8201;% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with about 96&#8201;% selectivity for liquid oxygenates (formic acid selectivity over 90&#8201;%). Importantly, O2 generation was suppressed 68&#8201;%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H2O2 in the chemical industry.

A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed iminoalkenylation of &#947;&#8208;alkenyl O&#8208;acyl oximes has been developed. Readily available alkenylboronic acids serve as alkenylation reagents, leading to densely functionalized pyrrolines. Both (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are accessible depending on the reaction solvent. Two stereocenters are established with complete diastereoselectivity and only one diastereomer is isolated. PC=photocatalyst, SET=single&#8208;electron transfer, EnT=energy transfer.

Both (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are accessible depending on the reaction solvent. In dichloromethane, (E)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are produced through a photoredox&#8208;mediated single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process. In tetrahydrofuran, (Z)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are generated by photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization of (E)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines though an energy&#8208;transfer pathway. Two stereocenters are established with complete diastereoselectivity and only one diastereomer is isolated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed iminoalkenylation of &#947;&#8208;alkenyl O&#8208;acyl oximes has been developed. Readily available alkenylboronic acids serve as alkenylation reagents, leading to densely functionalized pyrrolines. Both (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208; and (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are accessible depending on the reaction solvent. In dichloromethane, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are produced through a photoredox&#8208;mediated single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process. In tetrahydrofuran, (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are generated by photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines though an energy&#8208;transfer pathway. Two stereocenters are established with complete diastereoselectivity and only one diastereomer is isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
