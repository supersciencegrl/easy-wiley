         <title>A Discrete Four&#8208;Stranded &#946;&#8208;Sheet through Catenation of M2L2 Metal&#8211;Peptide Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for precisely constructing a &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly with number&#8208;defined strands in solution remains quite limited due to its intense aggregation property. Here, we report the precise construction of a four&#8208;stranded anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet by utilizing a non&#8208;covalent approach. This was achieved by folding and assembly of Ag+ and a pentapeptide (1) with the Ala&#8208;D3pa&#8208;Gly&#8208;3pa&#8208;Val (3pa: &#946;&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;alanine) sequence, which was designed to form an interlocking Ag2(1)2 ring through metal cross&#8208;linking of the side chains. NMR analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies characterized the structure of the discrete &#946;&#8208;sheet assembly as well as the remarkable structural selectivity in terms of strands&#8217; number, orientation and the sheet type.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Raman Probing of the Intrinsic Electric Field for High&#8208;Efficiency Screening of Electricity&#8208;Producing Bacteria at the Single&#8208;Cell Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of high&#8208;performance microbial fuel cells requires the evaluation of the activity of electrochemically active bacteria. However, this is challenging because of the time&#8208;consuming nature of biofilm formation and the invasive nature of labeling. To address this issue, we developed a fast, label&#8208;free, single&#8208;cell Raman spectroscopic method. This method involves investigating the &#8220;pure&#8221; linear Stark effect of endogenous CO in the silent region of biological samples, which allows for probing the intrinsic electric field in the outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes of live bacterial cells. We found that reduced outer&#8208;membrane cytochromes can generate an additional intrinsic electric field equivalent to an applied potential of +0.29 V. We also found that the higher the electrical activity of the cell, the larger the generated electric field. This was also reflected in the output current of the constructed microbial fuel cells. Raman spectroscopy was employed to facilitate the assessment of electrochemical activity at the single&#8208;cell level in highly&#8208;diluted bacterial samples. After analysis, inactive bacteria were ablated by laser heating, and 20 active cells were cultured for further testing. The rapid and high&#8208;throughput probing of the intrinsic electric field offers a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency screening of electrochemically active bacterial cells for bioenergetic and photosynthetic research.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Sandwich&#8208;Structured Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules Utilizing 11,12&#8208;Dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with regular folded sandwich configurations are constructed using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They can function efficiently as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high electroluminescence efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Constructing folded molecular structures is emerging as a promising strategy to develop efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Most folded TADF materials have V&#8208;shaped configurations formed by donors and acceptors linked on carbazole or fluorene bridges. In this work, a facile molecular design strategy is proposed for exploring sandwich&#8208;structured molecules, and a series of novel and robust TADF materials with regular U&#8208;shaped sandwich conformations are constructed by using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They hold outstanding thermal stability with ultrahigh decomposition temperatures (556&#8211;563&#8201;&#176;C), and exhibit fast delayed fluorescence and excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (86&#8201;%&#8211;97&#8201;%). The regular and close stacking of acceptor and donors results in rigidified molecular structures with efficient through&#8208;space interaction, which are conducive to suppressing intramolecular motion and reducing reorganized excited&#8208;state energy. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using them as emitters exhibit excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.6&#8201;%, which is a leading value for the OLEDs based on folded TADF emitters. These results demonstrate the proposed strategy of employing 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge for planar donors and acceptors to construct efficient folded TADF materials is applicable.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>Rapid Thermal Drying Synthesis of Nonthiolated Spherical Nucleic Acids with Stability Rivaling Thiolated DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal drying, highly stable spherical nucleic acids with a high DNA density were synthesized using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on gold nanoparticles. Applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensors.







Abstract
Attaching DNA oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) has offered tremendous insights into surface chemistry with resulting bioconjugates serving as critical reagents in biosensors and nanotechnology. While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison with the salt&#8208;aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensor platforms, facilitating cost&#8208;effective applications for SNAs.

While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly-adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side-by-side comparison with the salt-aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper-based sensor platforms, facilitating cost-effective applications for SNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bismuthenium Cations for the Transport of Chloride Anions via Pnictogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The search for main group derivatives that mediate chloride transport across phospholipid bilayers has led to the identification of chalcogen&#8208;supported diarylbismuthenium cations as suitable examples of such compounds. Deploying these water&#8208;stable cations in chloride&#8208;loaded vesicles shows that their transport properties can be adjusted by the strength of the chalcogen&#8594;bismuth interaction, as well as the overall lipophilicity of their structures.







Abstract
Our interest in the design of heavy pnictogen&#8208;based Lewis acids for anion trafficking across biological membrane mimics has led us to investigate trivalent bismuthenium cations as chloride anion transporters. Here, we describe two chlorodiarylbismuthines, elaborated on a peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene backbone and stabilized by an adjacent thio&#8208; or seleno&#8208;ether functionality that engages the bismuth center in a Ch&#8594;Bi interaction (Ch=chalcogen). These new derivatives are stable in aqueous environment and readiliy transport chloride anions across the membrane of phospholipid&#8208;based vesicles loaded with KCl. In addition to establishing the use of such motifs in anion transport, this investigation shows that the Lewis acidity, lipophilicity, and thus chloride transport properties depend on the nature of the chalcogen.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template&#8208;assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H2S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.







Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri (p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hydrazide&#8208;Based Nanochannels: Efficient Water Translocation and Salt Rejection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazide backbone&#8208;derived structures create a paired water&#8208;conveying conduit in the solid state and the lipid bilayer membrane. These channel arrangements effectively facilitate water transport across the bilayer membrane while preventing the passage of protons and salts.







Abstract
Nature has ingeniously developed specialized water transporters that effectively reject ions, including protons, while transporting water across membranes. These natural water channels, known as aquaporins (AQPs), have inspired the creation of Artificial Water Channels (AWCs). However, replicating superfast water transport with synthetic molecular structures that exclude salts and protons is a challenging task. This endeavor demands the coexistence of a suitable water&#8208;binding site and a selective filter for precise water transportation. Here, we present small&#8208;molecule hydrazides 1&#8201;b&#8211;1&#8201;d that self&#8208;assemble into a rosette&#8208;type nanochannel assembly through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, and selectively transport water molecules across lipid bilayer membranes. The experimental analysis demonstrates notable permeability rates for the 1&#8201;c derivative, enabling approximately 3.18&#215;108 water molecules to traverse the channel per second. This permeability rate is about one order of magnitude lower than that of AQPs. Of particular significance, the 1&#8201;c ensures exclusive passage of water molecules while effectively blocking salts and protons. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability and water transport properties of the water channel assembly inside the bilayer membranes at ambient conditions.

         <title>Unlocking of Hidden Mesopores for Enzyme Encapsulation by Dynamic Linkers in Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing dynamic boroxine linkers into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333 creates defects that expand pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the inherent pore size of MOFs. This strategy allows the immobilization of glycoenzymes in MOFs for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising supports for the immobilization of enzymes, yet their applications are often limited by small pore apertures that constrain the size of encapsulated enzymes to below 5&#8197;nm. In this study, we introduced labile linkers (4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;boroxintriyl)&#8208;tribenzoate, TBTB) with dynamic boroxine bonds into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333, resulting in PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB with enhanced enzyme loading and protection capabilities. The selective breaking of B&#8722;O bonds creates defects in PCN&#8208;333, which effectively expands both window and cavity sizes, thereby unlocking hidden mesopores for enzyme encapsulation. Consequently, this strategy not only increases the adsorption kinetics of small enzymes (&lt;5&#8197;nm) such as cytochrome c (Cyt C) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but also enables the immobilization of various large&#8208;sized enzymes (&gt;5&#8197;nm), such as glycoenzymes. The glycoenzymes@PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB platform was successfully applied to synthesize thirteen complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability. The dynamic linker&#8208;mediated enzyme encapsulation strategy enables the immobilization of enzymes exceeding the inherent pore size of MOFs, thus broadening the scope of enzymatic catalytic reactions achievable with MOF materials.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system was developed using O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent. This system is based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling.

Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2 in&#8197;situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57&#8197;mM with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.

         <title>Unveiling the Aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C Single Atoms into Highly Efficient MOOH Nanoclusters during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activation and aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C (M=Ni, Fe, and Co) single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are demonstrated. In this process, both N and supported carbon are severely oxidized, leading to the destruction of M&#8722;N bonds. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism, the isolated M atoms finally aggregate to form MOOH nanoclusters. MOOH nanoclusters with a carbon support are responsible for the enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites. However, the oxidative structural evolution of coordinated N during the OER will probably damage the structure of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, hence resulting in a completely different reaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials during the alkaline OER. Taking Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C as an example, multiple characterizations show that the coordinated N on the surface of Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C is almost completely dissolved in the form of NO3&#8722;, accompanied by the generation of abundant O functional groups on the surface of the carbon support. Accordingly, the Ni&#8722;N bonds are broken. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism and further oxidation, the isolated Ni atoms are finally converted to NiOOH nanoclusters supported by carbon as the real active sites for the enhanced OER. Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C also have similar aggregation mechanism. Our findings provide unique insight into the structural evolution and activity origin of M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based catalysts under electrooxidative conditions.

         <title>Unusual Cross&#8208;Conjugation in Cyclic Dipeptide&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Donor&#8211;Acceptor Semiconducting Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross conjugation is typically less effective for electron delocalization and thus rarely used in semiconducting polymers. We developed TIDP, a novel building block featuring a cyclic dipeptide with backbone cross conjugation. TIDP showed a rigid, coplanar conformation with well&#8208;delocalized &#960; electrons. Polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Cross conjugation, though prevalent in many organic compounds, is typically considered less effective for electron delocalization compared to linear conjugation. Consequently, it is rarely used as the backbone structure for semiconducting conjugated polymers. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel building block, TIDP, which features a central cyclic dipeptide with cross conjugation characteristics. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions confer TIDP with a highly rigid and coplanar conformation. Importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that &#960; electrons are well delocalized across the entire structure, despite its low aromaticity. Conjugated polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating the effective &#960; electrons delocalization of this innovative building block. Our findings show that with rational design, cross conjugation can achieve effective &#960; electrons delocalization, providing a valuable approach for developing high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers for organic electronic materials.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8722;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8722; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&#8722; binding to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have rethought the role of Cl&#8722; ions, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step approach to bottlebrush synthesis using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) enables control over side&#8208;chain chemistry and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of degradable bottlebrush polymers.







Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young's modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.

This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side-chain chemistries and provides insight into the light-mediated grafting-through polymerization of dithiolane-functionalized macromonomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>dGAE(297&#8211;391) Tau Fragment Promotes Formation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8208;Like Tau Filaments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro methods for obtaining disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau are needed for diagnostics and drug development against tauopathies. We show that the chronic traumatic encephalopathy type II fold can be propagated onto full&#8208;length tau by seeding the aggregation with the tau fragment dGAE. The work brings us closer to in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific tau filament types.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T cells. This work demonstrates that in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74&#8201;% yield, &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1.

         <title>Hydrazine&#8208;Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Of Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis is described. The polymerizations proceed with high stereoselectivity and show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, and low dispersity values.







Abstract
Materials formed by the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins are highly valued for industrial and academic applications but are difficult to prepare free of metal contaminants. Here we describe a highly efficient metal&#8208;free ROMP of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis. Reactions can be initiated via in situ condensation of a [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic hydrazine catalyst with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde initiator. The polymerizations show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, low dispersity values, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Additionally, the hydrazine can be used in substoichiometric amounts relative to the aldehyde chain&#8208;end while maintaining good control over molecular weight and low dispersity values, indicating that a highly efficient chain transfer mechanism is occurring.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Assisted Ligand Exchange Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency AgBiS2 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) plays a critical role in CQD solar cells. Here, a solvent engineering strategy is proposed to optimize the solid&#8208;state ligand exchange process. This strategy enables improved AgBiS2 CQD films, leading to solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% higher than that of the control one, as well as enhanced stability.







Abstract
As the initial synthesized colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are generally capped with insulating ligands, ligand exchange strategies are essential in the fabrication of CQD films for solar cells, which can regulate the surface chemical states of CQDs to make them more suitable for thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices. However, uncontrollable surface adsorption of water molecules during the ligand exchange process introduces new defect sites, thereby impairing the resultant device performance, which attracts more efforts devoted to it but remains a puzzle. Here, we develop a solvent&#8208;engineering&#8208;assisted ligand exchange strategy to revamp the surface adsorption, improve the exchange efficiency, and modulate the surface chemistry for the environmentally friendly lead&#8208;free silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) CQDs. The optimized AgBiS2 CQD solar cells deliver an outstanding champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 8.95&#8201;% and improved long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is less environment&#8208;dependent and can produce solar cells with negligible performance variance for several batches across several months. Our work demonstrates the critical role of solvents for ligand exchange in the surface chemistry of CQDs and the realization of high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices in a highly reproducible manner.

         <title>Revitalizing Dead Zinc with Ferrocene/Ferrocenium Redox Chemistry for Deep&#8208;Cycle Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dissolve oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy is proposed to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which differs from the widely concerned dendrite suppression strategies. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen and the generated ferricenium cations can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries are highly desirable for sustainable and large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the ceaseless dendrite growth and the derived dead Zn are principally responsible for the capacity decay and insufficient lifespan. Here, we propose a dissolved oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which can be realized by incorporating a trace amount of poly(ethylene glycol) as a solubilizer to improve the solubility of water&#8208;insoluble ferrocene derivatives. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen, which eradicates the dissolved oxygen&#8208;involved Zn corrosion and insulating by&#8208;product generation. Subsequently, the generated ferricenium cations as the scavenger can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss. Through this design, the symmetric cell exhibited improved cycle life of 3700&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 220&#8197;h under a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. Importantly, the Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cells demonstrated the impressive cycling stability over 1500&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 3.0.

     alt="Revitalizing Dead Zinc with Ferrocene/Ferrocenium Redox Chemistry for Deep-Cycle Zinc Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dissolve oxygen-initiated revitalization strategy is proposed to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which differs from the widely concerned dendrite suppression strategies. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen and the generated ferricenium cations can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to compensate the zinc loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries are highly desirable for sustainable and large-scale electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the ceaseless dendrite growth and the derived dead Zn are principally responsible for the capacity decay and insufficient lifespan. Here, we propose a dissolved oxygen-initiated revitalization strategy to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which can be realized by incorporating a trace amount of poly(ethylene glycol) as a solubilizer to improve the solubility of water-insoluble ferrocene derivatives. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen, which eradicates the dissolved oxygen-involved Zn corrosion and insulating by-product generation. Subsequently, the generated ferricenium cations as the scavenger can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to compensate the zinc loss. Through this design, the symmetric cell exhibited improved cycle life of 3700&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and 220&#8197;h under a high depth of discharge of 80&#8201;%. Importantly, the Zn||NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cells demonstrated the impressive cycling stability over 1500&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 3.0. This work presents an innovative solution for the revitalization of dead Zn to extend the lifespan of deep-cycling metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thermally Populated Germylene&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A germylene&#8208;based D&#8722;A molecule was synthesized by radical head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization under mild conditions. The coordination of Lewis acids led to intramolecular single electron transfer upon heating to form a thermally populated triplet diradical. This work provided an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species in main group chemistry.







Abstract
This work reports synthesis of a germylene based donor&#8208;acceptor molecule and its thermal excitation to a triplet state by coordination with a Lewis acid. Products have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, and SQUID measurement, in conjunction with DFT calculation. The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the donor&#8208;acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8722;18.8 to &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C6F5)3 (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species of heavier main group elements.

         <title>Dye induced luminescence properties of gold(I) complexes with near unity quantum efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the glow of gold complexes. Herein, we report a facile synthetic strategy to introduce a dye, namely, 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin, as a ligand to access luminescent gold complexes of different nuclearity. Introduction of the dye enables the isolation of gold complexes with rich photophysical properties such as high emission quantum yields.







Abstract
To study the effect of a dye on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of metal complexes, a series of gold(I) complexes were synthesized, containing a 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin luminophore. The complexes are comprised of a coumarin moiety featuring different ancillary ligands, specifically N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, triphenylphosphine, and diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylphosphine. The synthesized gold(I) complexes are luminescent both in solution and the solid state at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Complexes of different nuclearity, i.e., mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trinuclear compounds were synthesized. A clear trend between the nuclearity and the quantum yields can be seen. The coumarin dye not only improves the PL properties, but also enhances the luminescence of trinuclear clusters, which are otherwise known to be weak emitters in solution. The optical absorption properties were investigated in detail by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Enhancing Hole Transport Uniformity for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Optimizing Buried Interface Contacts and Suppressing Interface Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) was introduced between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite film. P&#8208;XPA made the HTL planar, promoted perovskite crystallization, and effectively passivated the bottom defects of the perovskite film. Ultimately, the device power conversion efficiency reached 25.87&#8201;% and the stability was significantly improved.







Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembly material has been recognized as a highly effective approach for mitigating nickel oxide (NiOx) surface&#8208;related challenges in inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, its uneven film generation and failure to effectively passivate the buried interface defects limit the device&#8216;s performance improvement potential. Herein, p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) containing bilateral phosphate groups (&#8722;PO3H2) is introduced as an interface layer between the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz and the perovskite layer. P&#8208;XPA can flatten the surface of hole transport layer and optimize interface contact. Meanwhile, p&#8208;XPA achieves better energy level alignment and promotes interfacial hole transport. In addition, the bilateral &#8722;PO3H2 of p&#8208;XPA can chelate with Pb2+ and form hydrogen bond with FA+ (formamidinium cation), thereby suppressing buried interface non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the IPSC with p&#8208;XPA buried interface modification achieves champion power conversion efficiency of 25.87&#8201;% (certified at 25.45&#8201;%) at laboratory scale (0.0448&#8197;cm2). The encapsulated target device exhibits better operational stability. Even after 1100&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C, its efficiency remains at an impressive 82.7&#8201;% of the initial efficiency. Molecules featuring bilateral passivation groups optimize interfacial contact and inhibit interfacial recombination, providing an effective approach to enhancing the stability and efficiency of devices.

         <title>Enhancement of Lithium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction by Modifying Center Atom of Tetraalkyl&#8208;Type Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alcoholic proton carriers in lithium mediated nitrogen reduction were replaced with ionic liquids (ILs). Switching the central atom in these ILs notably boosted performance, increasing Faradaic efficiency (FE) by 1.45&#8197;times when switching from phosphonium to ammonium cations with an FE of 39.5&#8201;% and remained stable for over 12&#8197;h.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a viable alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia production. However, ethanol, a common proton carrier in Li&#8208;NRR, exhibits electrochemical instability, leading to oxidation at the anode or byproduct formation at the cathode. This study replaces alcoholic proton carriers with ionic liquids (ILs), specifically tetrabutylphosphonium chloride (TBPCl) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl), to examine how the electronegativity differences between the central atom and adjacent carbon of the cation affect catalytic performance. The results show that switching the central atom in tetraalkyl&#8208;type ILs markedly enhances performance, specifically resulting in a 1.45&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency (FE) with the transition from phosphonium to ammonium cation of ILs. Additionally, optimal IL concentrations in the electrolyte are identified to maximize ammonia yield. TBACl, in particular, demonstrates enhanced ammonia production and operational stability, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 13.60&#8197;nmol/cm2/s, an FE of 39.5&#8201;%, and operational stability for over 12&#8197;h under conditions of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 and 10&#8197;atm. This research underscores the potential of precise IL modifications for more efficient and sustainable Li&#8208;NRR.

Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 achieved months&#8208;long autotrophic growth and acetate production through CO2 fixation coupled to sulfur oxidation, driven by biogenic CdS nanoparticles under light.







Abstract
Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of acyclic and cyclic tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. Applications to the late&#8208;stage modification of complex heterocycles are presented.

We report a strategy for the formal C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary amines via the in situ generation and displacement of N&#8208;acyl ammonium species. Specifically, treatment of diverse tertiary amines with TFAA or chloroformates in the presence of NaI leads to the efficient generation of alkyl iodides, which can be engaged directly in Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Structure Enables Ultrahigh &#8216;Strong&#8208;Tough&#8217; Design of Phosphorus Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical cracking thickness of alloy&#8208;type anodes is typically suboptimal due to the inverse relationship between mass loading and intrinsic toughness. This issue is addressed by the development of a nacre&#8208;like structure, which contributes fast ionic/electronic migration and ultrahigh &#8216;strength&#8208;toughness&#8217;. Such structure design contributes to the enhancement of mass loading and long&#8208;life cycle stability of alloy&#8208;type anodes with high specific capacity.







Abstract
Red phosphorus anode, attributed to its high specific capacity of 2596&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, is expected to improve the energy density of Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, the P anode currently is unsatisfactory for practical usage due to the large volume expansion beyond 300&#8201;%, which brings out uncontrolled brittle failure. To address this challenge, we here design a nacre&#8208;like phosphorus anode by resilient graphene oxide staggered together. The staggered structure simultaneously offers mechanical strength and interwoven toughness. Finite element modeling reveals that the sodiation stress from P nanoparticles will be transferred into interlayer pillars as the elastic medium to release sodiation stress. The prepared anode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 13&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a mass loading of 5.8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the volume change of the anode is limited to approximately 8.1&#8201;% at full sodiation, significantly lower than that of the traditional phosphorus electrodes.

         <title>Cleavage of Homonuclear Chalcogen&#8208;Chalcogen Bonds in a Hybrid Platform in Response to X&#8208;Ray Radiation Potentiates Tumor Radiochemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;directed generation of chalcogens (S, Se, Te) in response to external ionizing radiation to enable drug decaging in target lesions remains a huge challenge. Hybrid monodisperse organosilicon nanoprodrugs containing homonuclear chalcogen&#8211;chalcogen single bonds have now been developed as a versatile X&#8208;ray&#8208;ultraresponsive nanoplatform for tumor radiochemotherapy.







Abstract
Chalcogens are used as sensitive redox&#8208;responsive reagents in tumor therapy. However, chalcogen bonds triggered by external ionizing radiation, rather than by internal environmental stimuli, enable site&#8208;directed and real&#8208;time drug degradation in target lesions. This approach helps to bypass chemoresistance and global systemic toxicity, presenting a significant advancement over traditional chemoradiotherapy. In this study, we fabricated a hybrid monodisperse organosilica nanoprodrug based on homonuclear single bonds (disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S, approximately 240&#8197;kJ/mol), diselenium bonds (Se&#8722;Se, approximately 172&#8197;kJ/mol), and tellurium bonds (Te&#8722;Te, 126&#8197;kJ/mol)), including ditelluride&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DTeMSNs), diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSeMSNs) and disulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs (DSMSNs). The results demonstrated that differences in electronegativities and atomic radii influenced their oxidation sensitivities and reactivities. Tellurium, with the lowest electronegativity, showed the highest sensitivity, followed by selenium and sulfur. DTeMSNs exhibited highly responsive cleavage upon exposure to X&#8208;rays, resulting in oxidation to TeO32&#8722;. Furthermore, chalcogen&#8208;hybridized organosilica was loaded with manganese ions (Mn2+) to enhance the release of Mn2+ during radiotherapy, thereby activating the the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and enhancing the tumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth. This investigation of hybrid organosilica deepens our understanding of chalcogens response characteristics to radiotherapy and enriches the design principles for nanomedicine based on prodrugs.

         <title>Nanoporous Heterojunction Photocatalysts with Engineered Interfacial Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous and chemically bonded S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is synthesized by hybridization of two semiconducting MOFs, which exhibits excellent performance of photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a promising strategy for sustainable production of ammonia (NH3). However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency with great room to improve regarding the charge carrier utilization and active site engineering. Herein, a porous and chemically bonded heterojunction photocatalyst is developed for efficient PNRR to NH3 production via hybridization of two semiconducting metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL&#8208;125&#8722;NH2 (MIL=Material Institute Lavoisier) and Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytripehenylene). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the formation of Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Co chemical bonds at the interface, which not only serve as atomic pathway for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer, but also provide electron&#8208;deficient Co centers for improving N2 chemisorption/activation capability and restricting competitive hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the nanoporous structure allows the transportation of reactants to the interfacial active sites at heterojunction, enabling the efficient utilization of charge carriers. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF&#8208;based heterojunction exhibits remarkable PNRR performance with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%, superior to most reported PNRR photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

Herein, a porous and chemically bonded heterojunction photocatalyst is developed for efficient PNRR to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production via hybridization of two semiconducting metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL-125&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (MIL=Material Institute Lavoisier) and Co-HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytripehenylene). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the formation of Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Co chemical bonds at the interface, which not only serve as atomic pathway for S-scheme charge transfer, but also provide electron-deficient Co centers for improving N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chemisorption/activation capability and restricting competitive hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the nanoporous structure allows the transportation of reactants to the interfacial active sites at heterojunction, enabling the efficient utilization of charge carriers. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF-based heterojunction exhibits remarkable PNRR performance with an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%, superior to most reported PNRR photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of high-performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks with Superhelical Nanostructures Enable Efficient Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers were synthesized by manipulating the lengths of alkyl chains in enantiopure BINOL&#8208;based organic linkers. The resulting 3D chiral COFs formed right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed superhelix fibers with macroscopic chirality. These nanofibers exhibit significantly enhanced enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding and a remarkable chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect.







Abstract
Despite significant advancements in fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse morphologies, creating COFs with superhelical nanostructures remains challenging. We report here the controlled synthesis of homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers by manipulating pendent alkyl chain lengths in organic linkers. This approach yields homochiral 3D COFs 13&#8208;OR with a 10&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure (R=H, Me, Et, nPr, nBu) from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based tetraaldehydes and tetraamine. COF&#8208;13&#8208;OEt exhibits macroscopic chirality as right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed superhelical fibers, whereas others adopt spherical or non&#8208;helical morphologies. Time&#8208;tracking shows a self&#8208;assembly process from non&#8208;helical strands to single&#8208;stranded helical fibers and intertwined superhelices. Ethoxyl substituents, being of optimal size, balance solvophobic effects and intermolecular interactions, driving the formation of superhelical nanostructures, with handedness determined by BINOL chirality. The superhelical nature of these materials is evident in their chiral recognition and spin&#8208;filter properties, showing significantly improved enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding (up to six times higher enantioselectivity) and a remarkable chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect with a 48&#8211;51&#8201;% spin polarization ratio, a feature absent in non&#8208;helical analogs.

         <title>Intermolecular Anionic Mixed&#8208;Valence and &#960;&#8208;Dimer Complexes of ortho&#8208;Pentannulated Bisazacoronene Diimide</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reduction of ortho&#8208;pentannulated bisazacoronene diimides in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent has led to the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence and &#960;&#8208;dimer species.

Abstract
This study reports the serendipitous discovery of intermolecular anionic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) and &#960;&#8208;dimer species in ortho&#8208;pentannulated BisAzaCoroneneDiimides (BACDs) during their electrochemical reduction in a non&#8208;aqueous solvent. A library of nitrogen&#8208;containing extended PDIs was synthesized via an aza&#8208;benzannulation reaction followed by a Pd&#8208;catalysed ortho&#8208;pentannulation reaction. Ortho&#8208;pentannulated BACDs revealed strong aggregation abilities in solution. Concentration&#8208;dependent UV/Vis absorption spectra, variable temperature 1H NMR experiments, and atomic force microscopy coupled to molecular dynamics support their self&#8208;assembly into columnar aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry experiments in dichloromethane reveal prominent splitting of the first reduction wave, attributed to the formation of unprecedented intermolecular anionic MV and &#960;&#8208;dimers in organic solvent. These species were thoroughly characterized by real&#8208;time spectroelectrochemistry, electrochemical simulations and theoretical calculations. Remarkably, this work underscores the tuneable nature of AzaBenzannulatedPerylene Diimides (AzaBPDIs) and BACDs, emphasizing their potential as a promising scaffold for designing supramolecular materials with long&#8208;range radical anion delocalization. The observation of this phenomenon provides insights into the fundamental behaviour of supramolecular organic semiconductors, thereby paving the way for the development of novel electronic devices and electron&#8208;deficient materials.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nitrides with Visible Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Invisible Thermal&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Ultraviolet Delayed Fluorescence for Security Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence, visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli&#8208;production invisible ultraviolet (UV) delayed fluorescence (DF) is discovered by introducing oxygen relevant groups into carbon nitrides. The prepared materials exhibit great potentials in security protections by means of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF with superior concealment.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;mode emissive materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive producing invisible signals are very attractive for advanced security applications, but development of such materials remains highly challenging. In this work, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitrides (O&#8208;CNs) are prepared via microwave&#8208;assisted heating of urea, which exhibit ultraviolet (UV) solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSFL), visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli production of invisible UV delayed fluorescence (DF) properties. Further studies confirmed that the SSFL and RTP could be attributed to the introduction of oxygen functional group (e.&#8201;g., C=O) in the skeleton of O&#8208;CNs, thus minimizing the aggregation caused quenching effect, facilitating intersystem crossing, and stabilizing the excited triplet states. The specific thermal&#8208;stimuli production of UV DF is deemed to be the relatively large energy gap between ground and excited singlet states as well as an effective triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Notably, the emission maximum of UV DF locates at ~310&#8197;nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 19&#8197;nm, so it is completely invisible to the naked eyes, but detectable by a UV camera. To employ the unique characteristics of O&#8208;CNs, security protection strategies with superior concealment by virtue of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF are demonstrated.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement Towards a White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Adamantane&#8208;Type Cluster Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of an ethylene bridge into a quaternary adamantane&#8208;type cluster core {Si(CH2)n(C2H4)mSn3S3} (n/m=3/0 or 2/1) causes distinct distortions, which the molecules escape by an unprecedented dimerization of the cluster cores. This structural change affects the (extreme) nonlinear optical properties of such white&#8208;light emitting materials, as shown by a combined experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study.







Abstract
Group 14/16 adamantane&#8208;type hybrid clusters of the type [(RT)4E6] (T=group 14 element, E=group 16 element, R=organic group) have been reported to emit white&#8208;light when irradiated in an amorphous state with a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) infrared laser diode. This effect is enhanced if the cluster core is varied from a binary to a more complex composition. To further explore this phenomenon, we synthesized clusters with a multinary R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217; composition, including isolobal replacement of E with CH2, in [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}3] (1, Np=naphthyl). When expanding one of the CH2 moieties to a C2H4 group, thus generating a R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217;/E&#8217;&#8217; cluster composition, we unexpectedly observed a dimerization of the initially formed, yet non&#8208;isolable adamantane&#8208;like cluster [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}] (2) to [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}]2 (3), exhibiting a heretofore unprecedented cluster architecture. Both monomeric 1 and dimeric 3, show white&#8208;light emission as thin films. The nonlinear optical response of the compounds was also modelled with DFT methods.

When expanding one of the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moieties to a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; group, thus generating a R/R&#8217;-T/T&#8217;-E/E&#8217;/E&#8217;&#8217; cluster composition, we unexpectedly observed a dimerization of the initially formed, yet non-isolable adamantane-like cluster [(2-NpSi){CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn(S)Ph}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn(S)Ph}] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) to [(2-NpSi){CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn(S)Ph}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn(S)Ph}]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), exhibiting a heretofore unprecedented cluster architecture. Both monomeric &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and dimeric &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, show white-light emission as thin films. The nonlinear optical response of the compounds was also modelled with DFT methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochromic Displays Based on Photoswitchable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic intricate pictures with striking structural colors are imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive optical materials are attractive for many areas, from healthcare to art design. However, creating intricate color&#8208;changing patterns for visual information is still a challenge. This work describes the preparation of mechanochromic structural colored intricate pictures imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photoswitch. The photoswitch contains a photoisomerizable cinnamate moiety and was incorporated in a main chain liquid crystal oligomer with photopolymerizable acrylate end groups. After coating, the structural colored film was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in air causing E/Z isomerization of the cinnamate units leading to a redshift of the structural color of the film. A grayscale photomask was used to spatially control the photoisomerization reaction and imprint colorful pictures such as portraits and landscapes, in the cholesteric liquid crystal films with high resolution. Photopolymerization in a nitrogen atmosphere led to a mechanochromic cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer with striking structural colors that blueshift upon strain. The sharp details of the patterns were preserved even under deformation and the system returned to the initial state upon strain removal. Our work offers a simple photoswitch approach to prepare stimuli responsive optical polymers imprinted with color&#8208;changing pictures of unprecedented complexity.

         <title>Boryloxy Titanium Complex&#8208;Enabled High Polar Monomer Contents in Catalytic Copolymerization of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining a high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands play significant roles for the excellent catalytic performances.







Abstract
The preparation of polyolefins with high polar monomer contents (above 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%) has long been a challenge. Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands have been designed and synthesized. The complexes (Cp*)[HCN(Ar)]2BOTiCl2 (2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; 5, Ar=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) supported by Cp* and the boryloxy ligands have been shown to efficiently catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene and long chain &#945;&#8208;olefins. In particular, precatalyst 5 enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% while maintaining the high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands could effectively stabilize cationic active species. The mechanical studies on the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized copolymers disclosed that they exhibited high strength and toughness because of the existence of hydrogen bonds in the polymer network.

         <title>Anomalous Pressure&#8208;Induced Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission of Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Clusters: The Competitive Effect between Cuprophilic Interactions and Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The competitive effect between cuprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions achieved the anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence of ionic copper&#8208;iodide clusters, which corresponds to the triplet excitons exhibiting a luminescence dominated by 3TSCT and supplemented by 3CC.







Abstract
Developing ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with multiple emitting is crucial for enriching lighting and display materials with various colors. However, the luminescent properties of traditional ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters are often closely associated with low&#8208;energy cluster&#8208;centered triplet emission, which will redshift further as the Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu bond length decreases. This article utilizes a pressure&#8208;treated strategy to achieve an anomalous pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted luminescence phenomenon in ionic Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 crystals for the first time, which is based on dominant through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT). Herein, we reveal that the more advantageous through&#8208;space interactions in the competition between cuprophilic interactions and through&#8208;space interactions can lead to a blue&#8208;shifted luminescence. High&#8208;pressure angle&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;pressure infrared experiments show that the enhanced through&#8208;space interactions mainly originate from forming new intermolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I hydrogen bonds and the enhancement of van der Waals interactions between organic cations and anionic clusters. Theoretical calculations and experimental studies of excited&#8208;state dynamics confirm that the blue&#8208;shifted emission is due to the increased energy gap between the excited triplet and ground states caused by the electron delocalization under stronger through&#8208;space interactions. This work deepens previous understanding and provides a new avenue to design and synthetic ionic copper&#8208;iodine clusters with high&#8208;energy TSCT emission.

         <title>Complex Dance of Molecules in the Sky: Choreography of Intermolecular Structure and Dynamics in the Cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O Hetero Ternary Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with comprehensive theoretical calculations provides a first observation and analysis of the c&#8208;C5H8&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster, unveiling the subtle interplay of forces that govern its formation.







Abstract
This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO2 and H2O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its C2 symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.

         <title>Regulating the Spin&#8208;State of Cobalt in Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Iodine Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the catalytic activity is heavily reliant on the electronic structure of the catalyst, understanding the impact of electron spin regulation on electrocatalytic performance is still rarely investigated. This work presents a novel approach involving the single&#8208;atom coordination of cobalt (Co) within metalloporphyrin&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D&#8208;COFs) to facilitate the catalytic conversion for sodium&#8208;iodine batteries. The spin state of Co is modulated by altering the oxidation state of the porphyrin&#8208;centered Co, achieving optimal catalysis for iodine reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that CoII and CoIII are incorporated into the 3D&#8208;COFs, exhibiting spin ground states of S = 1/2 and S = 0, respectively. The low spin state of CoIII is favorable to hybridize with the sp 3d orbitals of I3&#8208;, thus facilitating the conversion of I3&#8208; to I&#8208;. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the presence of CoIII enhances iodide adsorption and accelerates the formation of NaI in 3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII, thereby promoting its rapid kinetic behaviors. Notably, the I2@3D&#8208;COFs&#8208;CoIII cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of 227.7 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and demonstrates exceptional cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 10 C with a minor capacity fading rate of less than one 0.01% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Dioxide Catalyzed Polymerization of N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) and Its Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) marks a milestone in the development of&#160;conducting polymers. Currently, n&#8208;PBDF is prepared by either duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, where scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness may present challenges. Here, we report a general, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for n&#8208;PBDF and its derivatives, namely selenium dioxide (SeO2) catalyzed polymerization. We discovered that a catalytic amount of selenium dioxide leads to high monomer conversions (&gt;99% by NMR). The obtained n&#8208;PBDF exhibits a consistently narrow hydrodynamic diameter distribution and its thin films show high conductivities. Furthermore, we revealed that this polymerization involves a mechanism distinct from the previously reported radical pathway. It involves successive Riley oxidation and aldol polycondensation processes. It was also found that the reduced selenium precipitates from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) when the catalytic cycle is terminated, allowing for a straightforward purification process through centrifugation and filtration. This method thus eliminates the need for the costly and slow dialysis process. Finally, we demonstrated that SeO2 catalyzed polymerization is applicable to n&#8208;PBDF derivatives, proving the generality of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This multimodal characterization approach was instrumental in elucidating elusive mechanistic information in the dual&#8208;cycle mechanism, shedding light on phenomena such as the unchanged ethylene selectivity despite decreasing aromatics selectivity, while ethylene could solely be derived from arene&#8208;based reaction intermediates. This study could improve the process efficiency in zeolite catalysis by connecting steaming&#8208;induced changes in the organic reaction mechanisms with inorganic material aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Triagonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm&#8208;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Active Sites of Metal/Metal Oxide Catalysts by Oxide Ligand Overlayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering sites of supported metal catalysts is essential to enhancing activity and selectivity. Such enhancement is typically achieved by particle size modification, surface alloying, or attaching molecular ligands. Yet, control strategies for complex, multifunctional molecules and catalysts, where selectivity is crucial, are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that submonolayer WOx with tunable coverage preferentially decorates well&#8208;coordinated Pt terrace sites as a stable ligand. By combining experimental kinetics with probe molecules, in situ spectroscopies, and first&#8208;principles modeling, we show that the WOx coverage on Pt modifies the metal&#8208;to&#8208;acid site balance while retaining the acid strength intact and results in optimal reactivity for metal&#8208;acid catalyzed reactions at a specific metal, size, and support&#8208;dependent WOx coverage. The oxide can also alter the reactant adsorption mode, reversing selectivity and pathways from terrace&#8208; to step&#8208;dominated, as evidenced in furfural decarbonylation and hydrogenation. The insights open avenues for improving metal/metal oxide catalysts beyond the specific system.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and C&#8210;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8210;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8210;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8210;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to enhance the stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Incorporation of DTPA&#8208;Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This strategy effectively regulates the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry, promoting uniform zinc deposition, inhibiting detrimental side reactions, and preventing manganese dissolution, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA&#8208;Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).

         <title>Unraveling C&#8208;Selective Ring&#8208;Opening of Phosphiranes with Carboxylic Acids and Other Nucleophiles: A Mechanistically&#8208;Driven Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site selective nucleophilic attack at the carbon site of phosphiranes has been accomplished under metal&#8208;free conditions. The reaction mechanism of this unprecedented transformation is discussed based on experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
Phosphiranes are weak Lewis bases reacting with only a limited number of electrophiles to produce the corresponding phosphiranium ions. These salts are recognized for their propensity to undergo reactions with oxygen pronucleophiles at the phosphorus site, leading to the formation of phosphine oxide adducts. Building on a thorough mechanistic understanding, we have developed an unprecedented approach that enables the selective reaction of carboxylic acids, and other nucleophiles, at the carbon site of phosphiranes. This method involves the photochemical generation of highly reactive carbenes, which react with 1&#8208;mesitylphosphirane to yield ylides. The latter undergoes a stepwise reaction with carboxylic acids, resulting in the production of the desired phosphines. In addition to DFT calculations, we have successfully isolated and fully characterized the key intermediates involved in the reaction.

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8208;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8208;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8208;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8208;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8208;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6 mA cm&#8208;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8208;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyethylene Recycling Via Water Activation By Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most prevalent type of plastic waste and also the most challenging to depolymerize because of its inert carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) bonds.[1] High temperature and noble metals are usually required for depolymerization.[2] To avoid using noble metals, costly reagents and harsh reaction conditions, it is worthwhile but challenging to explore new reaction pathways.[3] We report an unprecedented mechanochemical reaction of PE and water to result in shorter&#8208;chain alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, and ketones (Cn, where n &#8818; 50), with above 80 % of starting carbon converted into these products, which could be a valuable feedstock for re&#8208;entering chemical value chains. This reaction is driven solely by ball milling, without heating and pressurizing. No costly catalysts are used. Instead, only earth&#8208;abundant Al&#8322;O&#8323; was milled with reactants.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and DFT calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8226;&#8211;) = +1.67 V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Space through Automated Reasoning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast size of composition space poses a significant challenge for materials chemistry: exhaustive enumeration of potentially interesting compositions is typically infeasible, hindering assessment of important criteria ranging from novelty and stability to cost and performance. We report a tool, Comgen, for the efficient exploration of composition space, which makes use of logical methods from computer science used for proving theorems. We demonstrate how these techniques, which have not previously been applied to materials discovery, can enable reasoning about scientific domain knowledge provided by human experts. Comgen accepts a variety of user&#8208;specified criteria, converts these into an abstract form, and utilises a powerful automated reasoning algorithm to identify compositions that satisfy these user requirements, or prove that the requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied. In contrast to machine learning techniques, explicitly reasoning about domain knowledge, rather than making inferences from data, ensures that Comgen&#8217;s outputs are fully interpretable and provably correct. Users interact with Comgen through a high&#8208;level Python interface. We illustrate use of the tool with several case studies focused on the search for new ionic conductors. Further, we demonstrate the integration of Comgen into an end&#8208;to&#8208;end automated workflow to propose and evaluate candidate compositions quantitatively, prior to experimental investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Oxidation Catalyzed by Perovskites: The Role of Crystallographic Distortions Highlighted by Systematic Experiments and Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of key materials&#8217; parameters correlated with the performance can accelerate the development of heterogeneous catalysts and unveil the relevant underlying physical processes. However, the analysis of correlations is often hindered by inconsistent data. Besides, nontrivial, yet unknown relationships may be important, and the intricacy of the various processes may be significant. Here, we tackle these challenges for the CO oxidation catalyzed by perovskites using a combination of rigorous experiments and artificial intelligence. A series of 13 ABO3 (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm; B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) perovskites was synthesized, characterized, and tested in catalysis. To the resulting dataset, we applied the symbolic&#8208;regression SISSO approach. We identified an analytical expression correlated with the activity that contains the normalized unit&#8208;cell volume, the Pauling electronegativity of the elements A and B, and the ionization energy of the element B. Therefore, the activity is described by crystallographic distortions and by the chemical nature of A and B elements. The generalizability of the identified descriptor is confirmed by the good quality of the predictions for 3 additional ABO3 and of 16 chemically more complex AMn(1&#8208;x)B&#8217;xO3 (A = La, Pr, Nd; B&#8217; = Fe, Co Ni Cu, Zn) perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Fuel&#8208;driven&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated Superstructures to Form Transient Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out-of-equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far-from-equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels. Upon fueling the NDI-derived fibers, a dual-component activation and deactivation pathway is deduced by kinetic analysis and is absent when using a molecularly dissolved resting state. Investigating the solid-state morphologies of the structures formed throughout the fuel-driven reaction cycle using cryo-EM reveals that the resting thermodynamic fibers evolve to transient thicker fibrils and layered superstructures. We show that the transient redox-active hydrogels exhibit a nearly threefold increase in electrical conductivity upon fuel consumption before reverting to their original value over hours.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MoO 3 &#160;by Surface Oxidation of Mo 2 C (MXene) for Stable Near&#8208;Surface Reactions in Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a promising positive electrode material for aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity. However, MoO3&#160;faces several challenges in an aqueous electrolyte, such as easy dissolution of reaction products, volume expansion, and low conductivity, which severely limit its application in aqueous batteries. In this work, we effectively increased the overall conductivity of the electrode by in&#8208;situ growing MoO3&#160;on the Mo2C MXene layer. MXene can effectively inhibit the dissolution and structural loss of MoO3&#160;reaction products. Additionally, the coordination effect of Mo2C and MoO3&#160;achieves a stable near&#8208;surface reaction on the MXene laminates, resulting in the Mo2C/MoO3&#160;composite exhibiting excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.4 A/g). The energy storage mechanism of H+/Al3+&#160;co&#8208;insertion/extraction was elucidated through non&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterization, and the promotion effect of Mo2C on MoO3&#160;reaction kinetics was verified by density functional theory calculations. This work provides new insights into improving the stability of AAIB cathodes and extends the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>De(sulfon)amidative Cyclization: The Synthesis of Dibenzolactams and Dibenzosultams for Organic Light Emitting Diode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study addresses a challenge in organic synthetic chemistry: the direct cleavage of amide bonds, which is typically hampered by the thermodynamic stability of the C(Ar)&#8211;C(acyl) bond. Previous methods often rely on &#8220;CO&#8221; extrusion&#8208;jointing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed process and require activated tertiary amides, limiting their applicability due to incompatibility with reactive functional groups such as halogens. Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free approach for the deamidative cyclization of biaryl diamides via a radical process, yielding dibenzolactam derivatives. Along this line, we have developed the desulfonamidative cyclization of biaryl disulfonamides to produce dibenzosultams through direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution, demonstrating high selectivity for unsymmetrical structures. Additionally, unsymmetrical sulfamoyl biaryl amides, containing both amide and sulfonamide functionalities, can selectively undergo desulfonamidative coupling with the amide to form dibenzolactams, which offers a complementary synthetic pathway to unsymmetric dibenzolactams. These protocols exhibit excellent compatibility with reactive functional groups, including halogens, providing an innovative synthetic toolbox for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). DMAC&#8208;PDO, incorporating a dibenzolactam as the acceptor unit, serves as an efficient blue TADF emitter with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 23.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250 cycles with 81.4% capacity retention when charged to 4.8 V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000 cycles if charged to 4.6 V (vs. Li+/Li).&#160;&#160;Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compact luminophores with long emission wavelengths have aroused considerable theoretical and practical interest. Organics with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were attached to the 4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini&#8208;phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162 g&#183;mol&#8208;1, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750 nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485 cm&#8208;1 (403 nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended 4,5&#8208;Fused Bis&#8208;Fluorene: Highly Open&#8208;Shell Compounds and their Cationic Tetrathiafulvalene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from Doped Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the thionation products of phthalimide into its matrix leads to highly efficient red/near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence with boosted quantum yields of up to ~33&#8201;%. Newly generated emissive clusters and the external heavy atom effect are two key factors to the red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence, while the high efficiency arises from the enhanced exciton generation efficiency and energy transfer process upon doping.







Abstract
Organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with low toxicity and facile synthesis are highly sought after, particularly for applications in biotechnology and encryption. However, achieving efficient red/NIR RTP emitters has been challenging due to the weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling of organics and the rapid nonradiative decay imposed by the energy gap law. Here we demonstrate highly efficient red/NIR RTP with boosted quantum yields (&#934;ps) of up to 32.96&#8201;% through doping the thionated derivatives of phthalimide (PAI) (MTPAI and DTPAI) into PAI crystals. The red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence (PL) stems from a combination of the external heavy atom effect and the formation of emissive clusters centered around electron&#8208;rich sulfur atoms. Furthermore, the dopants enhance exciton generation efficiency and facilitate energy transfer from smaller PAI units to larger aggregates, leading to dramatically increased &#934;p. This strategy proves universal, opening possibilities for acquiring long&#8208;wavelength RTP with tunable photophysical properties. The doped crystals exhibit promising applications in optical waveguides and encryption paper/ink. This research provides a practical approach to obtaining long&#8208;wavelength RTP materials and offers valuable insights into the mechanisms governing host&#8208;guest systems.

         <title>Asymmetrified Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Solid Additives Enable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electron&#8208;deficient isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives to optimize the properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device, SF&#8208;1&#8208; and SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated devices displayed regulated fibrillar donor&#8208;acceptor network, improved exciton diffusion length, and thus enhanced power conversion efficiencies approaching 19&#8201;%, which is one of rare solid additives for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells.







Abstract
Disordered polymer chain entanglements within all&#8208;polymer blends limit the formation of optimal donor&#8208;acceptor phase separation. Therefore, developing effective methods to regulate morphology evolution is crucial for achieving optimal morphological features in all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). In this study, two isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives based on the widely&#8208;used electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole unit in nonfullerene acceptors. The incorporation of SF&#8208;1 or SF&#8208;2 into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend induces stronger molecular packing via molecular interaction, leading to the formation of continuous interpenetrated networks with suitable phase&#8208;separation and vertical distribution. Furthermore, after treatment with SF&#8208;1 and SF&#8208;2, the exciton diffusion lengths for PY&#8208;DT films are extended to over 40&#8197;nm, favoring exciton diffusion and charge transport. The asymmetrical SF&#8208;2, characterized by an enhanced dipole moment, increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device to 18.83&#8201;% due to stronger electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a ternary device strategy boosts the PCE of SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated APSC to over 19&#8201;%. This work not only demonstrates one of the best performances of APSCs but also offers an effective approach to manipulate the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends using rational&#8208;designed solid additives.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin.

     alt="Structure-Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;-Catenin"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+4 and &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+4,&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring-closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high-affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;-catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell-based assay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inhibition of intracellular protein-protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co-activator protein and oncogene &#946;-catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high-affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;-helical &#946;-catenin-binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;-catenin inhibitor with single-digit micromolar activity in a cell-based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Protocol to Access Silacyclobutanes with Unprecedented Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Peterson&#8208;Type Olefination Reactivity and its Use in a Silicon&#8208;Promoted Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of a silene and the C=O bond of a variety of carbonyl compounds produces four&#8208;membered silaoxetane heterocycles. These intermediates can be characterized, and engage in alkene&#8208;forming retro&#8208;cycloaddition reactions by the addition of SiO2. Moreover, the silene olefination reagent can be formed in&#8197;situ, giving rise to a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of adamantylsilene and the carbonyl group of aliphatic, aromatic or acetylenic ketones and aldehydes is demonstrated. The product of this reaction that is central to a non&#8208;ionic version of the Peterson olefination is an unusual four&#8208;membered 1,2&#8208;silaoxetane heterocycle that was characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. In the presence of SiO2, the silaoxetane undergoes retro&#8208;cycloaddition with the formation of alkene products. As the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds without the necessity of any base, enolizable ketones can be converted into olefins. In addition, it is shown that the adamantylsilene can be produced in&#8197;situ by a sila&#8208;Peterson reaction, providing valuable input for the development of a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.

         <title>Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8211;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordering of multiple sidechains on a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by the assembly of linkers that differ only in the appended functional groups at a chiral centre. The strain induced by the functional groups defines the conformation of each linker and drives their ordering in the crystal structure of the framework. The pore environments formed by this assembly have well&#8208;defined adsorption sites for hexane isomers and enhance their separation.







Abstract
Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8211;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognize and order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.

         <title>Diphenylacetylene&#8208;Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins with diphenylacetylene as a key building block have been prepared. Owing to the rigidity of the resulting macrocycle, conformational isomers can be isolated, unlike known, flexible expanded porphyrins. The irreversible conformational inversion, coupled with the distinct spectral and color features of the isomers, allowed us to fabricate a new accumulated thermal sensor capable of indicating exposure to high temperatures.







Abstract
An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as 1A and 1B. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer 1B leads to its irreversible conversion to 1A, whereas in its protonated form, 1A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA undergoes irreversible transformation to 1B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA at lower temperatures. These temperature&#8208;dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.

     alt="Diphenylacetylene-Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanded porphyrins with diphenylacetylene as a key building block have been prepared. Owing to the rigidity of the resulting macrocycle, conformational isomers can be isolated, unlike known, flexible expanded porphyrins. The irreversible conformational inversion, coupled with the distinct spectral and color features of the isomers, allowed us to fabricate a new accumulated thermal sensor capable of indicating exposure to high temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as &lt;b&gt;1A&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1B&lt;/b&gt;. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer &lt;b&gt;1B&lt;/b&gt; leads to its irreversible conversion to &lt;b&gt;1A&lt;/b&gt;, whereas in its protonated form, &lt;b&gt;1A&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;2MSA&lt;/b&gt; undergoes irreversible transformation to &lt;b&gt;1B&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&lt;b&gt;2MSA&lt;/b&gt; at lower temperatures. These temperature-dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Photon clusteroluminescence (with emission wavelength up to 688&#8197;nm) was achieved in small clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with only two isolated heteroatomic units through the efficient and n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation, which promotes the in vivo bioimaging of CLgens with excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single&#8208;photon excited long&#8208;wavelength (686&#8197;nm) and high&#8208;efficiency (29&#8201;%) CL, two&#8208;photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units. TSC stabilized in the aggregate state has been proven to realize efficient spatial electron delocalization similar to conventionally conjugated compounds. Encouraged by the excellent TPCL properties, two&#8208;photon imaging of blood vessels in vivo and biocompatibility verification utilizing CLgens are also achieved. This work illustrates the essential role of TSC in promoting nonlinear optical properties of CLgens and may facilitate further design and development of the next generation of bioprobes with excellent biocompatibility.

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

         <title>Highly Diffusive Nonluminescent Carriers in Hybrid Phase Lead Triiodide Perovskite Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated carriers can be captured by phase transition induced defects (PTIDs) formed by hybrid&#8208;phase within the same MAPbI3 single crystal and then be &#8220;protected&#8221; form radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations. The mobility of PTID&#8208;dressed nonluminescent carriers is successfully promoted by about 14&#8208;fold to as high as 1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, comparing with band&#8208;edge free carriers at room temperature. What's more, facilitated by this highly diffusive nonluminescent carrier within, the MAPbI3 NWs&#8208;based photodetector's responsivity is promoted by about three times.







Abstract
Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single&#8208;crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires (1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, about a 14&#8208;fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long&#8208;distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.

         <title>A Grafting Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Benchmark Selectivity of C2H2/CO2 Separation under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0 V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution.&#160;To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0 V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu.&#160;The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100 % at 0.10 V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Multi&#8208;Site Chelation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis base 2D covalent organic frameworks, TFT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF are applied to mitigate energetic mismatches and introduce effective n&#8208;type surface energetics and band bending via cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions. Such a multi&#8208;site chelation effect enables a high efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) and excellent stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and moisture&#8208;induced degradation significantly impede the development of highly efficient and stable inverted (p&#8211;i&#8211;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which require high&#8208;quality perovskite bulk. In this research, we mitigate these challenges by integrating thermally stable perovskite layers with Lewis base covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The ordered pore structure and surface binding groups of COFs facilitate cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions, enhancing the perovskite quality across both its bulk and grain boundaries. This process not only reduces defects but also promotes improved energy alignment through n&#8208;type doping at the surface. The inclusion of COF dopants in p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices achieves power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) for a 0.0748&#8208;cm2 device and 23.49&#8201;% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device. Remarkably, these devices retain 81&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 978&#8197;hours of accelerated aging at 85&#176;C, demonstrating remarkable durability. Additionally, COF&#8208;doped devices demonstrate excellent stability under illumination and in moist conditions, even without encapsulation.

         <title>[5]Helicene Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles with Persistent Figure&#8208;Eight and M&#246;bius Shapes: Efficient Synthesis, Chiral Resolution and Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons hold great potential as chiroptical materials, though their synthesis remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present a simple approach using Suzuki coupling of a [5]helicene building block with various aromatic units, enabling the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of chiral macrocycles with persistent figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Single&#8208;crystal structures of 7 compounds were solved, and 22 enantiomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC. A notable pyrene&#8208;bridged figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, with its rigid, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and overcrowded structure, exhibited pure excimer emission and outstanding circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, including a large dissymmetric factor (|glum| = 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and significant CPL brightness (BCPL = 710.5 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1). This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for producing various chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles and singly or triply twisted M&#246;bius macrocycles with C2 and D3 symmetry, offering tunable chiroptical properties for CPL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero)arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecular host&#8208;guest complexes with enhanced performance, relative to those of their components, is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry. Here we explore a host&#8208;guest system consisting of an atomically precise gold nanocluster bound inside a zinc porphyrin nanoring. UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence titrations with different sized nanorings revealed strong binding between a pyridinethiol&#8208;coated Au25 nanocluster and a nanoring consisting of six zinc porphyrin units, and complexation is confirmed by mass spectrometry. Formation of this assembly enhances the stability of the gold nanocluster. The host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity for photochemical CO2 to CO conversion and singlet oxygen generation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>

         <dc:description>l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool&#8217;s funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amination of 2&#8208;Arylethanols with Weak N&#8208;Nucleophiles in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic deoxyamination of readily available 2&#8208;arylethanols offers an appealing, simple, and straightforward means of accessing &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines of biological interest. Yet, it currently represents a great challenge to synthetic chemistry. In most cases, the alcohol has to be either pre&#8208;activated in situ or converted into a reactive carbonyl intermediate, limiting the substrate scope for some methods. Examples of direct dehydrative amination of 2&#8208;arylethanols are still scarce. Here, we describe a catalytic protocol based on the synergy of triflic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol, which enables the direct and stereospecific amination of a broad array of 2&#8208;arylethanols, and does not require any pre&#8208;activation of the alcohol. This approach yields high value&#8208;added products incorporating sulfonamide, amide, urea, and aniline functionalities. In addition, this approach was applied to the sulfidation of 2&#8208;arylethanols. Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Formamidinium Incorporates into Rb&#8208;based Non&#8208;perovskite Phases in Solar Cell Formulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), are among the most promising emerging photovoltaic materials. However, the spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite phase to an inactive non&#8208;perovskite phase complicates the application of FAPbI3&#160;in solar cells. To remedy this, alkali metal cations, most often Cs+, Rb+or K+, are included during perovskite synthesis to stabilize the photoactive phase. The atomic&#8208;level mechanisms of stabilization are complex. While Cs+&#160;dopes directly into the perovskite lattice, Rb+&#160;does not, but instead forms an additional non&#8208;perovskite phase, and the mechanism by which Rb confers increased stability remains unclear. Here, we use&#160;1H&#8211;87Rb double resonance NMR experiments to show that FA+&#160;incorporates into the Rb&#8208;based non&#8208;perovskite phases (FAyRb1&#8208;yPb2Br5&#160;and&#160;&#948;&#8208;FAyRb1&#8208;yPbI3) for both bromide and iodide perovskite formulations. This is demonstrated by changes in the&#160;1H and&#160;87Rb chemical shifts,&#160;1H&#8211;87Rb heteronuclear correlation spectra, and&#160;87Rb{1H} REDOR spectra. Simulation of the REDOR dephasing curves suggests up to ~60% FA+&#160;incorporation into the inorganic Rb&#8208;based phase for the bromide system. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the substitution of FA+&#160;into the non&#8208;perovskite phase may contribute to the greater stability conferred by Rb salts in the synthesis of FA&#8208;based perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure Determination by 3D Electron Diffraction of the Extra&#8208;large Pore Zeolite ITQ&#8208;70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the synthesis, characterization, and structural analysis of a novel zeolite, ITQ&#8208;70, using 3D electron diffraction tomography. This unique material was synthesized under alkaline conditions, employing tetrakis(diethylamino)phosphonium as organic structure&#8208;directing agent, leading to the formation of a pure silica zeolite. ITQ&#8208;70 is distinguished by its extra&#8208;large pore apertures, which extend along all three axes and intersect one to each other. A notable feature of this zeolite is the presence of structurally ordered defects in very high concentration (38% of the silicon atoms). As a result, ITQ&#8208;70 exhibits the lowest framework density (10.0 T/1000&#197;3) ever reported for any zeolite except RWY (7.6 T/1000&#197;3), which contains sulfur instead of oxygen connecting T&#8208;atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for the Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation of Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of a DNA Polymerase Caught while Incorporating Responsive Dual&#8208;Functional Nucleotide Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalizing nucleic acids using DNA polymerases is essential in biophysical and biotechnology applications. This study focuses on understanding how DNA polymerases recognize and incorporate nucleotides with diverse chemical modifications, aiming to develop advanced nucleotide probes. We present the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq) with C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified environment&#8208;sensitive 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (dUTP) probes. These nucleotides include SedUTP, BFdUTP and FBFdUTP, which bear selenophene, benzofuran and fluorobenzofuran, respectively, at the C5 position of uracil, and exhibit high conformational sensitivity. SedUTP and FBFdUTP serve as dual&#8208;app probes, combining a fluorophore with X&#8208;ray anomalous scattering Se or 19F NMR labels. Our study reveals that the size of the heterocycle influences how DNA polymerase families A and B incorporate these modified nucleotides during single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension reactions. Remarkably, FBFdUTP's responsiveness enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the binary complex formation and polymerase activity through fluorescence and 19F NMR. Comparative analysis of incorporation profiles, fluorescence, 19F NMR data, and crystal structures of ternary complexes highlights the enzyme's plasticity. Key insights are provided into the role of gatekeeper amino acids (Arg660 and Arg587) in accommodating and processing these modified substrates, offering a structural basis for next&#8208;generation nucleotide probe development.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a unique bacterial alkaloid assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and non&#8208;enzymatic dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from&#160;Xenorhabdus hominickii,&#160;xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of&#160;X. hominickii&#160;promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of&#160;xhpA&#8208;G&#160;in&#160;E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).</dc:description>

         <title>Second Generation Zwitterionic Aza&#8208;Diarylethene: Photoreversible CN Bond Formation, Three&#8208;State Photoswitching, Thermal Energy Release, and Facile Photoinitiation of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethenes are a well&#8208;studied and optimized class of photoswitches with a wide range of applications, including data storage, smart materials, or photocontrolled catalysis and biological processes. Most recently, aza&#8208;diarylethenes have been developed in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond connections are replaced by carbon&#8208;nitrogen connections. This structural elaboration opens an entire new structure and property space expanding versatility and applicability of diarylethenes. In this work, we present the second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which finally allows for fully reversible photoswitching and precise control over all three switching states. High&#8208;yielding photoswitching between the neutral open form and a zwitterionic&#160;Z&#160;isomer is achieved with two different wavelengths of light. The third zwitterionic&#160;E&#160;isomeric state can be reached up to 87% upon irradiation with a third wavelength. Its high energy content of &gt;10 kcal/mol can be released thermally by deliberate solvent change as trigger mechanism, rendering aza&#8208;diarylethenes into interesting candidates for molecular solar thermal energy&#160;storage (MOST) applications. The third state further serves as locking state, allowing to toggle light&#8208;responsiveness reversibly between thermally labile and thermally stable switching. Further, irradiation of the zwitterionic states leads to highly efficient photopolymerization of methyl acrylate (MA),&#160;directly harnessing the unleashed chemical reactivity of aza&#8208;diarylethene in materials applications.</dc:description>

However, existing slide&#8208;ring polymer systems primarily rely on hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions to achieve ring&#8208;axle interlocking in aqueous phases. This reliance limits the construction of slide&#8208;ring networks mainly to water&#8208;soluble polymers, excluding a diverse range of lipophilic polymers. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce efficient construction strategies that facilitate interpenetration in organic solvents, enabling the development of diverse slide&#8208;ring polymers and expanding their range and applications. Herein, by utilizing the pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions, we successfully facilitated the interpenetration of a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), enabling the efficient construction of two slide&#8208;ring polymer networks in organic solvents. One of these two slide&#8208;ring polymers demonstrates a unique network deformation mechanism along with outstanding mechanical properties compared with the control covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network, including maximum stress (4.43 vs 1.98 MPa), maximum strain (1285 vs 330%), and toughness (35.4 vs 3.92 MJ/m3). More importantly, this strategy of making slide&#8208;ring polymers is highly versatile, given the wide range of macrocyclic arenes and alkyl chain&#8208;containing polymers it can accommodate.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Efficient Macrocyclic Emitters Featuring Delayed Fluorescence by Conjugation Length and Cavity Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited&#8208;state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8208;A and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alternative macrocyclic construction (MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted MC&#8208;TNT exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.9%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, MC&#8208;TST with &#960;&#8208;bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85% in 5 wt% doped &#64257;lms, and the corresponding device's EQEmax reaches record&#8208;high 32.7% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4% at pH 7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Compatibility Modulation of Ligands in Low&#8208;Symmetry Multi&#8208;Cavity Discrete Coordination Cages by Neighbouring Cage Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexation of Pd(II) with a designer unsymmetrical bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (2:4 ratio) yielded a specific Pd2L4 type &#8220;single&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; (SCDCC), from a pool of 4 isomeric structures. The observed selctivity is attributed to inherent orientational preference of the ligand strands around the metal centers. Crafting a short coordinating arm at either ends of the bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (i.e the longer&#8208;arm) produced a pair of unsymmetrical isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands; whereas crafting the same short&#8208;arm at both ends of the ligand gives an unsymmetrical tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand. Complexation of Pd(II) with either of the isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands (3:4 ratio) resulted in corresponding low&#8208;symmetry &#8220;multi&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; MCDCC having two conjoined cavities, though the inherent relative orientational preference of the longer arms is not achievable in these cages. The enforced orientation is sustained by &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP). However, one&#8208;pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands in 3:2:2 ratio produced an integratively self&#8208;sorted mixed&#8208;ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer&#8208;arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;cavity and the homo&#8208;ligated triple cavity cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Modulation of H&#8208;bond Interaction and Steric Hindrance via Bio&#8208;molecular Additive Screening in Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addressing challenges such as side reaction and dendrite formation, electrolyte modification with bio&#8208;molecule sugar species has emerged as a promising avenue for Zn anode stabilization. Nevertheless, considering the structural variability of sugar, a comprehensive screening strategy is meaningful yet remains elusive. Herein, we report the usage of sugar additives as a representative of bio&#8208;molecules to develop a screening descriptor based on the modulation of the hydrogen bond component and electron transfer kinetics. It is found that xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide (Xos) with the highest H&#8208;bond acceptor ratio enables efficient water binding, affording stable Zn/electrolyte interphase to alleviate hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, sluggish reduction originated from the steric hindrance of Xos contributes to optimized Zn deposition. With such a selected additive in hand, the Zn||ZnVO full cells demonstrate durable operation. This study is anticipated to provide a rational guidance in sugar additive selection for aqueous Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Chirality Transfer in the Superbundles of Sequence&#8208;defined Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete oligomers can be used to precisely evaluate the structure&#8208;property relationship and enable unique chiroptical activities, however, the role of stereochemical sequences in chirality transfer is still unclear.

         <title>Nanoparticle Transport in Proximal Tubules with Rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced Necrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the open lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxenoid reactivity enabled by targeted photoactivation of periodate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of low&#8208;valent intermediates continues to inspire new modes of reactivity across synthetic chemistry. But while the generation and reactivity of both carbenes and nitrenes are well&#8208;established, difficulties in accessing oxene, their oxygen&#8208;based congener, has severely hampered its application in synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel approach to oxene generation through the violet&#8208;light photolysis of tetrabutylammonium periodate. By revealing an unexpected geometric change upon periodate photoexcitation that facilitates intersystem crossing, we have exploited the near&#8208;barrierless dissociation of triplet periodate into oxene. Under these operationally simple conditions, we have demonstrated the epoxidation of a wide range of substituted olefins, revealing unprecedented functional group compatibility. By overcoming the historic challenges associated with employing oxene as an intermediate in organic chemistry, we believe that this platform will inspire the development of new reactive oxygen&#8208;based methodologies across industry and academia.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Ion Co&#8208;insertion Induced Spontaneous and Reversible Phase Conversion Chemistry for Unprecedented Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues are highly promising electrode materials due to their versatile electrochemical activity and low cost. However, they often suffer from severe structural damage caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and dissolution of high&#8208;spin outer metal ions, resulting in poor cycle life. Material modification and electrolyte regulation have been the common approaches to address this issue, albeit with very limited success. We report here a novel and efficient strategy to preserve structural stability by co&#8208;inserting Co2+ and Zn2+ ions in KCo[Fe(CN)6]. This co&#8208;insertion induced a spontaneous and reversible phase conversion by the replacement of low&#8208;spin inner ion (Fe3+), which efficiently relieves structural damage caused by Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and metal&#8208;ion dissolution, leading to an outstanding Zn2+ storage capacity and an exceptional improvement of cycle life with a capacity retention of 97.7% over 4400 cycles at 40 C. We also demonstrated the enhancement of co&#8208;intercalation on ion migration using a combined approach of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides an important progress to solve the cycle stability of Prussian blue analogues towards their practical application as electrode materials for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Compact Penta(N,N&#8208;diphenylamino)corannulene as Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transport materials (HTMs) are essential for improving the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we have designed and synthesized a novel organic small molecule HTM, cor&#8208;(DPA)5, characterized by a bowl&#8208;shaped core with symmetric five diphenylamine groups. Compared to already&#8208;known HTMs, the bowl&#8208;shaped and relatively compact structure of cor&#8208;(DPA)5 facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, promotes film formations, and enhances charge transport. Consequently, the cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5 HTM exhibits high charge mobility, exceptional hydrophobicity, and a significantly elevated glass transition temperature. Superior to previously reported HTMs such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and cor&#8208;OMePTPA, our newly synthesized cor&#8208;(DPA)5 HTM is free from any ionic dopants. As a result, the dopant&#8208;free cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5&#8208;based PSC demonstrates an impressive efficiency of 24.01%, and exhibits outstanding operational stability. It retains 96% after continuous exposure to 1 sun irradiation for 800 hours under MPP (maximum power point) tracking in ambient air. These findings present a structurally compact novel HTM and exemplify a new approach to the molecular design of HTM for the development of stable and effective PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Allylic Nitriles via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Cyanation of Biaryl Diallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral nitriles are common motifs in organic photoelectric materials, biological compounds, and agrochemicals. Unfortunately, the limited synthetic approaches to axially chiral nitriles have impeded their availability. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitrile structures in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90% yield and &gt;99% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that both steric and electronic interactions play crucial roles in determining the enantioselectivity of this transformation. Moreover, this mild and facile protocol is also applicable for gram&#8208;scale preparation of the chiral nitriles.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Access to&#160;Phosphorus Ylide&#8208;fused Heteroarenes Possessing Tunable Optoelectronic Properties and High Nonlinear Optical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a novel family of ylidic P&#8208;heteroarenes (P1&#8208;P6), structurally featuring unique phosphonium cyclopentadienylide (P&#8208;Cp)&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;skeletons and synthetically prepared via an unexpected one&#8208;pot [2+3]/[3+3] phospha&#8208;annulation reaction. While the facile and modular synthesis allows the fine&#8208;tuning of their optical absorptions and redox properties, single&#8208;crystallographic and theoretical analysis of these P&#8208;heteroarenes further reveal that the fusion of P&#8208;Cp&#160;moiety leads to substantial intramolecular charge&#8208;separated features with high ylidic character values of up to 84%. Benefitted from such dipolar structures, these P&#8208;heteroarenes not only allows stepwise electrophilic substitution reaction for further structural &#960;&#8208;expansions, but also exhibit excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and optical limiting (OL) performances comparable to or exceed those of C60. As a model compound, the persistent radical&#8208;anion salt of P5a was also prepared through chemical reduction, thus offering valuable insights into the electronic structures of reduced P&#8208;ylidic species.

While the facile and modular synthesis allows the fine-tuning of their optical absorptions and redox properties, single-crystallographic and theoretical analysis of these P-heteroarenes further reveal that the fusion of P-Cp&#160;moiety leads to substantial intramolecular charge-separated features with high ylidic character values of up to 84%. Benefitted from such dipolar structures, these P-heteroarenes not only allows stepwise electrophilic substitution reaction for further structural &#960;-expansions, but also exhibit excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and optical limiting (OL) performances comparable to or exceed those of C60. As a model compound, the persistent radical-anion salt of P5a was also prepared through chemical reduction, thus offering valuable insights into the electronic structures of reduced P-ylidic species. Our work not only established a highly efficient synthetic method toward new P-heteroarenes, but also provide fundamental understanding of those fused-ring ylidic P-heterocycles with promising NLO/OL applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Matrix&#8208;Mediated Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dot (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD) is very promising for photovoltaic applications due to its good phase stability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving the CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs with tunable compositions and robust surface matrix remains a challenge. Here, the surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange of PQDs is proposed, in which a bi&#8208;functional molecule, tetrafluoroborate methylammonium (FABF4), is applied for the cation exchange and stabilizing surface matrix of PQDs. The results reveal that the FA+ of FABF4 molecules could exchange the Cs+ of CsPbI3 PQDs forming alloy CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, allowing to tune the spectroscopies of PQDs. Meanwhile, the BF4&#8208; of FABF4 molecules can effectively stabilize the surface lattice and substantially diminish the surface vacancies of PQDs, improving the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. Consequently, CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells deliver an efficiency of up to 17.49%, which is the highest value of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. This work provided important design principles for the composition and surface matrix regulation of PQDs for high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Neutral Network Enhanced Mesoscopic Thermodynamic Model for Unlocking the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure and properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface significantly influence the electrochemical processes of energy storage and conversion, yet the challenge lies in accurate description of both molecular characteristics and external field effects. Here, we develop a mesoscopic thermodynamic model that calculates the thermodynamic properties of electrolytes based on chemical potential, and its efficiency is enhanced by a deep neutral network. The deep neutral network enhanced mesoscopic thermodynamic (DeepMT) model effectively bridges the gap between micro&#8208;level characteristics of ions and macro&#8208;level effects of external field, enabling precise presentation of ion density distributions over complex conditions. Our result indicates that the DeepMT model not only demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement of approximately four orders of magnitude over direct theoretical calculations, but also accurately predicts interface properties including ion adsorption, surface charge, and differential capacitance through the statistical analysis of density distributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Microfluidic Precision Manufacture of High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Microspheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key bottleneck in developing chromatographic material is the chemically entangled control of morphology, pore structure, and material chemistry, which holds back precision material manufacture in order to pursue advanced separation performance. In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed,&#160;for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control&#160;over&#160;particle morphology, pore structure&#160;and material chemistry.&#160;The droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&lt;3%), enabling a 100% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re&#8208;optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of hmin&#8203;=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine&#8208;tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super&#8208;throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high&#8208;performance droplet&#8208;synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Removal of Residual Additive Enabling Perfect Crystallization of Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinges on the precise control of the perovskite film crystallization process, often improved by the inclusion of additives. While dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is traditionally used to manage this process, its removal from the films is problematic. In this work, methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO) was employed instead of DMSO to slow the crystallization rate, as MPSO is more easily removed from the perovskite structure. The electron delocalization associated with the benzene ring in MPSO decreases the electron density around the oxygen atom in the sulfoxide group, thus reducing its interaction with PbI2. This strategy not only sustains the formation of a crystallization&#8208;slowing intermediate phase but also simplifies the elimination of the additive. Consequently, the optimized PSCs achieved a leading power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% along with exceptional stability. This strategy provides a novel method for fine&#8208;tuning perovskite crystallization to enhance the overall performance of photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation via Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis with FeIII&#8208;Initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), where the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2 further enhance 1O2 generation. In this SF&#8208;CEC system, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can degrade protonated azo dyes by nearly 99&#8201;% within 10&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Contact Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) using commercial dielectric materials in contact&#8208;separation cycles with water can trigger interfacial electron transfer and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the inherent hydrophobicity of commercial dielectric materials limits the effective reaction sites, and the generated ROS inevitably undergo self&#8208;combination to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In typical CEC systems, H2O2 does not further decompose into ROS, leading to suboptimal reaction rates. Addressing the generation and activation of H2O2 is therefore crucial for advancing CEC. Here, we synthesized a catalyst by loading the dielectric material polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto ZSM&#8208;5 (PTFE/ZSM&#8208;5, PZ for short), achieving uniform dispersion of the catalyst in water for the first time. The introduction of an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), with the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2, further enhanced ROS generation. In the FeIII&#8208;initiated SF&#8208;CEC system, the synergistic effects of ROS and protonated azo dyes enabled nearly 99&#8201;% degradation of azo dyes within 10&#8197;minutes, a sixfold improvement compared to the CEC system. This represents the fastest degradation rate of methyl orange dye induced by ultrasound to date. Without extra oxidants, this system enabled stable dissolution of precious metals in weakly acidic solutions at room temperature, achieving 80&#8201;% gold dissolution within 2&#8197;hours, 2.5&#8197;times faster than similar CEC systems. This study also corrects the unfavorable perception of CEC applications under acidic conditions, providing new insights for the fields of dye degradation and precious metal recovery.

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C60. C60&#8208;TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.







Abstract
The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89&#8201;% than the control devices (23.66&#8201;%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.

         <title>A Clean One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Structurally Ordered Linear, Monocyclic, and Bicyclic Oligosiloxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetraacetoxysilanes reacted with silanols or silanediols under base&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions to selectively generate acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes. Cyclotetrasiloxanes and bicyclic pentasiloxanes with precisely constructed structures were obtained from successive one&#8208;pot reactions of a tetraacetoxysilane with various silanediols. The acetoxy&#8208;containing oligosiloxanes can serve as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and as new building blocks for heat&#8208;resistant materials.







Abstract
A highly selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction between Si&#8722;OAc (AcO=acetoxy) and Si&#8722;OH compounds that generates unsymmetrical and symmetrical oligosiloxanes concurrent with the release of acetic acid has been developed. The high selectivity arises from the reactivity difference that depends on the varying number of acetoxy groups present, thus facilitating a clean one&#8208;pot synthesis of oligosiloxanes. For instance, the reactions of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, or tetraacetoxysilanes with silanols furnish acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes in high yield. Two equivalents of tetraacetoxysilane can react with various silanediols to form 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexaacetoxytrisiloxanes, which subsequently react with a second molecule of a silanediol to selectively afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraacetoxycyclotetrasiloxanes. The cyclotetrasiloxanes further react with a third molecule of silanediol to provide unprecedented bicyclic pentasiloxanes with acetoxy groups at the bridgehead silicon atoms. Applications of the acetoxy&#8208;containing products as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and new building blocks for highly heat&#8208;resistant materials are demonstrated.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids for Nucleolin&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise supramolecular nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) were designed by incorporating a pair of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified with multiple nucleic acids and adamantane with functional targeting nucleic acid. These Supra&#8208;SNAs with multivalent structure exhibit enhanced nuclease resistance, cellular uptake, and gene regulation capabilities in comparison to single&#8208;stranded DNA molecule. Moreover, the inhibition of gene expression in tumor cells leads to down&#8208;regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thus effective cell proliferation and death against tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular spherical nucleic acids (m&#8208;SNAs) are a second generation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which are of significance in potential application of targeted delivery of nucleic acids or gene regulation due to their defined molecular structures. Nevertheless, m&#8208;SNAs typically involve a single DNA sequence which greatly limits its functions as either targeting purpose or gene regulation. In response, we proposed here a third generation, supramolecular spherical nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) with two different sequences to achieve both above&#8208;mentioned functions. Specifically, we constructed a series of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures by coupling a cell membrane receptor (i.e., nucleolin)&#8208;recognizing aptamer (AS1411)&#8208;modified adamantine as targeting probe and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antisense&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to specifically inhibit the overexpression of HER2 proteins for gene regulations. In comparison to the m&#8208;SNA precursors, such Supra&#8208;SNA structures exhibited enhanced levels of resistance to nuclease degradation, cellular uptake, gene regulation capabilities and tumor retention capacity. We demonstrated that Supra&#8208;SNAs exhibited optimal cell suppression rates and cell apoptosis via a phosphatidylinositol 3&#8208;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The well&#8208;defined molecular structures provide an attractive platform for investigating interrelationship between structure and property at the molecular level.

         <title>An Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev&#8208;Based Method for Inversion of Regioselectivity in Stereospecific Alkene 1,2&#8208;Aminohydroxylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to those observed using epoxidation initiation 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylation protocols. The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2&#8208;aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2-aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2-aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza-Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to, or more selective than those observed using epoxidation initiated 1,2-aminohydroxylation protocols. Replacement of water by other nucleophiles allows 1,2-amino(thio)etherification, diamination, aminoazidation and aminofluorination reactions. Intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane-like reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Cationic&#8208;Coordinated Perfluoropolymer Electrolytes with Strong Li+&#8208;Solvent Interaction for Solid State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed unique copolymerized perfluoropolymer electrolytes to enlarge the molecular distance through the ionic dipole interactions between the perfluoropolymer chains and solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt, which strongly facilitate the transport of Li+, achieving solid&#8208;state batteries with superior performance.







Abstract
The practical application of solid&#8208;state polymer lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is plagued by the inferior ionic conductivity of the applied polymer electrolytes (PEs), which is caused by the coupling of ion transport with the motion of polymer segments. Here, solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt with strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction are inserted into an elaborately engineered perfluoropolymer electrolyte via ionic dipole interaction, extensively facilitating Li+ transport and improving mechanical properties. The intensified formation of solvation structures of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates, as well as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawal properties of the F atoms in perfluoropolymers, give the PE high electrochemical stability and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells demonstrate a lifetime of 2500&#8197;h and an exceptionally high critical current density above 2.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Li||LiFePO4 batteries exhibit consistent cycling for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C, and Li||uncoated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells achieve 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.45&#8201;%, one of the best results reported to date based on PEs. Our discovery sheds fresh light on the targeted synergistic regulation of the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of PEs to extend the cycle life of LMBs.

         <title>d&#8208;Electrons of Platinum Alloy Steering CO Pathway for Low&#8208;charge Potential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from sluggish solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation kinetics of C and Li2CO3, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt d&#8208;electrons and develop an aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 battery with CO and Li2CO3 as the main discharge products. Note that the gas&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation reaction between CO and Li2CO3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with CoPt alloy&#8208;supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89 V at 50 &#181;A cm&#8208;2, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218 cycles at 50 &#181;A cm&#8208;2) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered d&#8208;band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO&#8208;selective Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selective construction of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through photoredox  catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycosylation of peptides and proteins can significantly impact their intrinsic properties, such as conformation, stability, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Current methods for preparing N&#8208;linked glycopeptides typically rely on amide bond formation, which can be limited by the presence of reactive functional groups like acids and amines. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides offers a promising approach to obtaining N&#8208;linked glycopeptides. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective Giese addition between N&#8208;glycosyl oxamic acid and peptides containing dehydroalanine (Dha) under visible light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the coupling of aspartic acid and glycosylamine, this approach utilizes the conjugation of N&#8208;glycosylated carbamoyl radicals with Dha, facilitating the straightforward modification of complex peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Critical View on the Use of DNA Hydrogels in Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous studies have reported in the past that the use of protein&#8208;encoding DNA hydrogels as templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) leads to better yields than the use of conventional templates such as plasmids or PCR fragments. Systematic investigation of different types of bulk materials from pure DNA hydrogels and DNA hydrogel composites using a commercially available CFPS kit showed no evidence of improved expression efficiency. However, protein&#8208;coding DNA hydrogels were advantageously used in microfluidic reactors as immobilized templates for repetitive protein production, suggesting that DNA&#8208;based materials offer potential for future developments in high&#8208;throughput profiling or rapid in situ characterization of proteins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that have yielded striking clinical successes. However, the efficacy of ADCs often suffers from issues associated with tumor heterogeneity and resistance. To overcome these problems, a new generation of ADCs comprising a single monoclonal antibody with multiple different payloads attached, termed multi&#8208;payload ADCs, have been developed. Here we deploy multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies to generate highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody conjugates comprising up to four different functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This work, which includes the use of a site&#8208;specific cyclopropenone (CPO)&#8208;based reagent, represents the first example of a homogeneous multi&#8208;payload ADC with a payload count greater than two, and thereby facilitates the development of the next generation of ADCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical Mediated Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Oxidation over Covalent Triazine/Heptazine&#8208;Based Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Baeyer&#8208;Villiger&#160; oxidation of ketones to the corresponding lactones/esters is a classic and essential reaction in the chemical industry. However, this oxidation process has not yet been achieved in ambient conditions with the aid of oxygen and heterogeneous photocatalysts. In this study, we developed an organic photocatalytic system using covalent triazine/heptazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTF&#8208;TB/CHF&#8208;TB) to enable the B&#8208;V oxidation reaction under mild conditions through a cascade reaction pathway. Experimental data and theoretical calculations showed that heptazine/triazine units can "chelate&#8221; and decompose the in situ generated H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). Compared to conventional methods that primarily involve metal&#8208;activated benzaldehyde at elevated temperatures (e.g., 60 oC), the &#8226;OH generated in our study can readily cleave the C&#8208;H bond of benzaldehyde, forming an active intermediate that drives subsequent sequential processes: O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH&#8594;Ph&#8208;CO&#8226;&#8594;Ph&#8208;COOO&#8226;. By employing this photocatalytic process, a yield of 91% and a selectivity of over 99&#8201;% were obtained in the oxidation of cyclohexanone to caprolactone at room temperature. This performance is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, and our CHF&#8208;TB catalyst demonstrates impressive reusability, maintaining a high yield after 5 consecutive runs. This work presents a straightforward approach for C&#8208;H cleavage by organocatalysts to produce &#949;&#8208;caprolactone in a mild manner by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation.</dc:description>

In this study, we developed an organic photocatalytic system using covalent triazine/heptazine-based frameworks (CTF-TB/CHF-TB) to enable the B-V oxidation reaction under mild conditions through a cascade reaction pathway. Experimental data and theoretical calculations showed that heptazine/triazine units can "chelate&#8221; and decompose the in situ generated H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). Compared to conventional methods that primarily involve metal-activated benzaldehyde at elevated temperatures (e.g., 60 oC), the &#8226;OH generated in our study can readily cleave the C-H bond of benzaldehyde, forming an active intermediate that drives subsequent sequential processes: O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH&#8594;Ph-CO&#8226;&#8594;Ph-COOO&#8226;. By employing this photocatalytic process, a yield of 91% and a selectivity of over 99&#8201;% were obtained in the oxidation of cyclohexanone to caprolactone at room temperature. This performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art catalysts, and our CHF-TB catalyst demonstrates impressive reusability, maintaining a high yield after 5 consecutive runs. This work presents a straightforward approach for C-H cleavage by organocatalysts to produce &#949;-caprolactone in a mild manner by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>

A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real&#8208;time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high-stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self-discharge characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;S&#8208;Selective Stille&#8208;Coupling Enables Stereodefined Alkene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Scalable and Sustainable Zinc (II) Ions&#8208;Glue&#8208;Assisted Conversion of Biomass Waste Bits into Carbon Aerogels for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;L/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanochemically-induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy using &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high&#8208;entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&#8722;1 during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering.

     alt="An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High-Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high-entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt-based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high-entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;mol&lt;sub&gt;C3H6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (23.5&#8197;mol&lt;sub&gt;C3H6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In a high-entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high-entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high-entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>

A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of molecular duplexes stabilized by up to 10 hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs between indolocarbazole and pyridine units have been investigated. In the presence of water, these duplexes transform into hydrated duplexes with water molecules inserted into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing manner. The two distinct forms can be reversibly switched through temperature changes, with characteristic signals observed spectroscopically.







Abstract
Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8800;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO2 as the cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn2+ ions and the MnO2 host, as well as increased interaction between H+ ions and MnO2. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn2+ insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.







Abstract
MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

         <title>Interface Engineering via Manipulating Solvation Chemistry for Liquid Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration.

&lt;p&gt;A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero-interphase, composed of gradient F, B-rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si-rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance and temperature-resistant lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &amp;gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero-interphase, composed of gradient F, B-rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si-rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high-temperature electrochemical performance.

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8722;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is rationally designed by the cation exchange method featuring self&#8208;limitation in the precise control over the composition and structure. The short atomic distance and the short&#8208;range cationic order of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enable the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O radicals, promoting an effective oxygen evolution reaction via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr-MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single-crystal X-ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh-MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal-based catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free&#8208;space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products. Our results cautions that the prediction of product structures based on the crystal structure can be misleading.







Abstract
A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6&#8197;&#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer. Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt's topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating, the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct. Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gel networks (dt&#8208;SRGs). In this study, a photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal&#8208;templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt&#8208;SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo&#8208;curable ligand&#8208;containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt&#8208;SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt&#8208;SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>

         <dc:description>
The selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts were established in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics reaction over ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11 zeolites via strategically integrating operando UV/Visible spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and controlled catalytic experiments. This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Borylative Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;Vinyl Cyclobutanols and Axial&#8208;to&#8208;Point Chirality Transfer in a Diastereoconvergent/Stereoretentive Allylation Scenery</title>

         <dc:description>
Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine&#8208;Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Near-full -spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full-spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP-PL emissions and high-pressure phase transitions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full-spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near-full-spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single-component two-dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (ETA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=(HO)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), is reported, achieved through high-pressure treatment. A pressure-induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red-shifted PL emissions, leading to the near-full-spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

A mixed crystalline m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 constructed by PHI network and internally embedded phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine framework (CHF&#8722;Ph) is synthesized via an in situ strategy. PHI and CHF&#8722;Ph form built&#8208;in type II heterojunction, and m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 has smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI. The hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic formic acid dehydrogenation reaches a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses most of the other organic photocatalysts.







Abstract
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have restricted the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8722;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8722;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8722;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Non&#8208;Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring&#8208;opening reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;di(piperidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of four-membered ring-embedded cycloarene &lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti-aromaticity and ultra-narrowband emission with a single-digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of fully fused &#960;-conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four-membered ring-embedded cycloarene (&lt;b&gt;MF2&lt;/b&gt;) was designed and synthesized in single-crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond-linked chiral macrocycle &lt;b&gt;MS2&lt;/b&gt; without two fused four-membered rings and its linear-shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; were also synthesized.

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d-HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen-centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited-state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen-bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, and I) was developed by dissecting exciton dynamics, which could be specifically activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808&#8197;nm laser excitation, enabling fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging&#8208;escorted efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934; 1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808&#8197;nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in &#934; 1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808&#8197;nm laser power density (0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of ligand-controlled, copper-catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-allylic boronates.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Migratory Hydroamidocarbonylation of Amide&#8208;Linked Alkenes to Access Chiral &#945;&#8208;Alkyl Succinimides</title>

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of synthetic macrocycles, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), were designed and synthesized. By incorporating unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold, ExR4 exhibited a flexible backbone. Most importantly, ExR4 displayed remarkable potential in constructing adsorptive materials for iodine capture.







Abstract
The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted &#8220;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds.

Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

&lt;p&gt;A polymer-to-monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene-based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo-DCv-LCN) is reported. The Azo-DCv-LCN can be programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo-DCv-LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv-LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv-LCNs are still limited to heat-assisted programming and polymer-to-polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene-based DCv-LCN with room-temperature programmability and polymer-to-monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene-containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water-activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv-LCN can be simply programmed, upon water-soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light-driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv-LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid-solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv-LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed-loop polymer-monomers-polymer recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shear&#8208;Strained Pd Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd single atoms suspended on interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed by dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were synthesized through low&#8208;temperature heat treatment. Pd&#8722;CuO introduces the dynamic effects of shear stress and carrier formation into Pd single atoms on dislocations, which can promote water activation and facilitate the hydrogenation of nitrate ions to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield of 4.2&#8197;mol.&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90&#8201;% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.

Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

An organic zwitterion comprising an acridinium cation and an amidate anion directly linked by an N&#8211;N bond was developed by Takeshi Yanai, Olga Garc&#237;a Manche&#241;o, Kohsuke Ohmatsu, Takashi Ooi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404890). With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries , additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <title>Artificial Polymerizations in Living Organisms for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review starts with a discussion on the diversity of artificial polymerizations, including those triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli, as well as those that occur spontaneously. The review also systematically summarizes the biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization including but not limited to safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Within living organisms, numerous nanomachines are constantly involved in complex polymerization processes, generating a diverse array of biomacromolecules for maintaining biological activities. Transporting artificial polymerizations from lab settings into biological contexts has expanded opportunities for understanding and managing biological events, creating novel cellular compartments, and introducing new functionalities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in artificial polymerizations, including those responding to external stimuli, internal environmental factors, and those that polymerize spontaneously. More importantly, the cutting&#8208;edge biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization, notably in safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and facilitating therapeutic efficacy are highlighted. Finally, this review outlines the key challenges and technological obstacles that remain for polymerizations in biological organisms, as well as offers insights into potential directions for advancing their practical applications and clinical trials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation operates under mild reaction conditions with low CO pressure (balloon) and exhibits excellent chemoselectivity for C(sp2)&#8722;I bond over other C(sp2)&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl, Br, OMs, and OTf).







Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides utilizing ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. The present methodology is found to be general, efficient, employs mild reaction conditions and showcases a broad substrate scope even with structurally complex molecules. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed mechanistic pathways distinct from those of conventional transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi&#8208;quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.

&lt;p&gt;We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi-quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR-I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR-II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR-emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two-color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three-color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non-invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>

Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.
