         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Benzylamine Derivatives: Synthesis of a Precursor to Levocetirizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical, transition metal&#8208;free method allows the enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamines by asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. Enantioselective lithiation of&#160;N&#8217;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;isopropyl ureas using a chiral lithium amide base generates a benzyllithium that undergoes an unactivated stereospecific intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamine in the form of its urea derivative, in up to &gt;99% ee. Treatment with acid induces an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; with retention of configuration, the product of which may be hydrolysed to the target amine.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel aluminum&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with uniform micropores for trace BTEX adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU&#8208;620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37 &#177; 0.73 &#197; and specific surface area of 1347 m2/g, was synthesized. It is constructed by one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped AlO6 clusters, formate ligands and 4,4',4''&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU&#8208;620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80 mmol/g at P/P0 = 0.01 and 298 K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU&#8208;620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU&#8208;620(Al).</dc:description>

         <title>A Compound I Mimic Reveals the Transient Active Species of a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme: Insight into the Stereoselectivity of P450&#8208;Catalysed Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining snapshots of cytochrome&#8197;P450s with their substrates in catalytically relevant poses has been a longstanding challenge. By exploiting the properties of a synthetic porphyrin that closely mimics the highly unstable P450 active species, styrene could be captured in poses that align with the experimental evidence. This approach shows great promise as a tool in the targeted design of more efficient P450 biocatalysts.







Abstract
Catching the structure of cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes in flagrante is crucial for the development of P450 biocatalysts, as most structures collected are found trapped in a precatalytic conformation. At the heart of P450 catalysis lies Cpd&#8201;I, a short&#8208;lived, highly reactive intermediate, whose recalcitrant nature has thwarted most attempts at capturing catalytically relevant poses of P450s. We report the crystal structure of P450BM3 mimicking the state in the precise moment preceding epoxidation, which is in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. This structure was attained by incorporation of the stable Cpd&#8201;I mimic oxomolybdenum mesoporphyrin IX into P450BM3 in the presence of styrene. The orientation of styrene to the Mo&#8208;oxo species in the crystal structures sheds light onto the dynamics involved in the rotation of styrene to present its vinyl group to Cpd&#8201;I. This method serves as a powerful tool for predicting and modelling the stereoselectivity of P450 reactions.

         <title>Emergence of Visible&#8208;Light Water Oxidation Upon Hexaniobate&#8208;Ligand Entrapment of Quantum&#8208;Confined Copper&#8208;Oxide Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of sensitizer&#8208;free visible&#8208;light water oxidation by CuO was achieved using water&#8208;soluble hexaniobate cluster anions to entrap quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals of the familiar earth&#8208;abundant metal oxide.







Abstract
The formation of small 1 to 3&#8197;nm organic&#8208;ligand free metal&#8208;oxide nanocrystals (NCs) is essential to utilization of their attractive size&#8208;dependent properties in electronic devices and catalysis. We now report that hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anions, [Nb6O19]8&#8722;, can arrest the growth of metal&#8208;oxide NCs and stabilize them as water&#8208;soluble complexes. This is exemplified by formation of hexaniobate&#8208;complexed 2.4&#8208;nm monoclinic&#8208;phase CuO NCs (1), whose ca. 350 Cu&#8208;atom cores feature quantum&#8208;confinement effects that impart an unprecedented ability to catalyze visible&#8208;light water oxidation with no added photosensitizers or applied potentials, and at rates exceeding those of hematite NCs. The findings point to polyoxoniobate&#8208;ligand entrapment as a potentially general method for harnessing the size&#8208;dependent properties of very small semiconductor NCs as the cores of versatile, entirely&#8208;inorganic complexes.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Ni/V2O3 Heterostructure Catalyst for Boosting Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach was developed to fabricate a low&#8208;cost Ni/V2O3 heterostructure catalyst, which can efficiently and stably catalyze the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Ni/V2O3 interface sites can optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable HOR performance.







Abstract
Alkaline fuel cells can permit the adoption of platinum group metal&#8208;free (PGM&#8208;free) catalysts and cheap bipolar plates, thus further lowering the cost. With the exploration of PGM&#8208;free hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts, nickel&#8208;based compounds have been considered as the most promising HOR catalysts in alkali. Here we report an interfacial engineering through the formation of nickel&#8208;vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) heterostructures to activate Ni for efficient HOR catalysis in alkali. The strong electron transfer from Ni to V2O3 could modulate the electronic structure of Ni sites. The optimal Ni/V2O3 catalyst exhibits a high intrinsic activity of 0.038&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Ni/V2O3 interface as the active sites can enable to optimize the hydrogen and hydroxyl bindings, as well as protect metallic Ni from extensive oxidation, thus achieving the notable activity and durability.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Sequencing of Epigenetic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Third&#8208;generation sequencing platforms provide fast, convenient, and often inexpensive means of DNA sequencing; however, direct detection of epigenetic bases is yet to be routinely achieved. Here, derivatisation and labelling techniques that enable profiling of cytosine modifications on these platforms are reviewed.







Abstract
The discovery of epigenetic bases has revolutionised the understanding of disease and development. Among the most studied epigenetic marks are cytosines covalently modified at the 5 position. In order to gain insight into their biological significance, the ability to determine their spatiotemporal distribution within the genome is essential. Techniques for sequencing on &#8220;next&#8208;generation&#8221; platforms often involve harsh chemical treatments leading to sample degradation. Third&#8208;generation sequencing promises to further revolutionise the field by providing long reads, enabling coverage of highly repetitive regions of the genome or structural variants considered unmappable by next generation sequencing technology. While the ability of third&#8208;generation platforms to directly detect epigenetic modifications is continuously improving, at present chemical or enzymatic derivatisation presents the most convenient means of enhancing reliability. This Review presents techniques available for the detection of cytosine modifications on third&#8208;generation platforms.

         <title>Lead(II) Formate in Rembrandt's Night Watch: Detection and Distribution from the Macro&#8208; to the Micro&#8208;scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray powder diffraction mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of The Night Watch, Rembrandt's most famous painting. A possible chemical pathway resulting in the formation of this compound in historical oil paint was explored via micro&#8208;analysis, notably using synchrotron radiation. New clues on the reactivity of metallic driers in oil systems were thus gathered.







Abstract
The Night Watch, painted in 1642 and on view in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is considered Rembrandt's most famous work. X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRPD) mapping at multiple length scales revealed the unusual presence of lead(II) formate, Pb(HCOO)2, in several areas of the painting. Until now, this compound was never reported in historical oil paints. In order to get insights into this phenomenon, one possible chemical pathway was explored thanks to the preparation and micro&#8208;analysis of model oil paint media prepared by heating linseed oil and lead(II) oxide (PbO) drier as described in 17th century recipes. Synchrotron radiation based micro&#8208;XRPD (SR&#8208;&#956;&#8208;XRPD) and infrared microscopy were combined to identify and map at the micro&#8208;scale various neo&#8208;formed lead&#8208;based compounds in these model samples. Both lead(II) formate and lead(II) formate hydroxide Pb(HCOO)(OH) were detected and mapped, providing new clues regarding the reactivity of lead driers in oil matrices in historical paintings.

         <title>A Visible Light Driven Nickel Carbonylation Catalyst: The Synthesis of Acid Chlorides from Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst has been develop. This offers a method for carbonylative coupling reactions with an earth abundant metal at ambient temperature for the conversion of alkyl halides into synthetically versatile acid chlorides. The acid chlorides can then be transformed into an array of challenging ester, thioester and amide products.







Abstract
We describe here the development of a visible light driven nickel carbonylation catalyst. The combination of the large bite&#8208;angle Xantphos ligand with nickel(0) generates a catalyst capable of activating alkyl halides toward carbonylation at ambient temperature in the presence of blue light irradiation, and the reductive elimination of high energy acid chloride products. Unlike classical carbonylations, where the coordination of carbon monoxide inhibits the reactivity of earth abundant nickel catalysts, a CO&#8208;associated nickel is found to be the active catalyst in the reaction. Coupling the build&#8208;up of acid chlorides with nucleophile addition can be used to access various amides, esters and thioesters, including those of sterically encumbered substrates or with metal&#8208;reactive functionalities.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Adduct of Atomic P(&#8722;1) as a Source of Phosphinidenes (PR), Diphosphorus (P2), and Indium Phosphide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelation approach was employed to access low&#8208;valent phosphorus centers. The resulting adducts act as P atom sources for phosphinidene (PR) transfer, indium phosphide synthesis, and neutral P2 transfer to organic substrates.







Abstract
We report phosphinidenes (PR) stabilized by an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chelate. These adducts include the parent phosphinidene, PH, which is accessed via thermolysis of coordinated HPCO. The reported FLP&#8208;PH species acts as a springboard to other phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds, such as FLP&#8208;adducts of diphosphorus (P2) and InP3. Our new adducts participate in thermal&#8208; or light&#8208;induced phosphinidene elimination (of both PH and PR, R=organic group), transfer P2 units to an organic substrate, and yield the useful semiconductor InP at only 110&#8201;&#176;C from solution.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Mixed&#8208;Linker Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Switchable Semiconductive Characteristics for Tailorable Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;linker MOF system Mn2[TTF]x[NiS4]1&#8722;x (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and sensing performances. The variation of linker ratios changed the electrical conductivity of MOFs and induced a switch of n&#8208;type/p&#8208;type semiconducting behaviors. By adjusting the ratio of the two linkers in MOFs, we realized the fabrication and optimization of volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors for different application scenarios.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), with diverse metal nodes and designable organic linkers, offer unique opportunities for the rational engineering of semiconducting properties. In this work, we report a mixed&#8208;linker conductive MOF system with both tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) moieties, which allows the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and semiconductive characteristics. By continuously increasing the molar ratio between tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene), the switching of the semiconducting behaviors from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type was observed along with an increase in electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude (from 2.88&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 to 9.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1). Furthermore, mixed&#8208;linker MOFs were applied for the chemiresistive detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), where the sensing performance was modulated by the corresponding linker ratios, showing synergistic and nonlinear modulation effects.

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties of a Biologically Relevant [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2] Diamond Core Motif with a Short Iron&#8208;Iron Distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;closed&#8208;core&#8221; FeIII2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex containing diminished Fe coordination and short Fe&#8722;Fe separation is shown to reproduce the large pre&#8208;edge intensity typically associated with the &#8220;open&#8208;core&#8221; structure in intermediate Q of soluble methane monooxygenase. This finding may broaden the scope of structural models considered for high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.







Abstract
Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations. The structures of high valent intermediates (Q in methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase) are debated since Fe&#8722;Fe distances of 2.5&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#197; were attributed to &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; cores with bridging or terminal oxido groups. We report the crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of a FeIII2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 complex (2) with tetrahedral (4C) centres and short Fe&#8722;Fe distance (2.52&#8197;&#197;), persisting in organic solutions. 2 shows a large Fe K&#8208;pre&#8208;edge intensity, which is caused by the pronounced asymmetry at the TD FeIII centres due to the short Fe&#8722;&#956;&#8722;O bonds. A &#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197; Fe&#8722;Fe distance is unlikely for six&#8208;coordinate sites in Q or X, but for a Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 core containing four&#8208;coordinate (or by possible extension five&#8208;coordinate) iron centres there may be enough flexibility to accommodate a particularly short Fe&#8722;Fe separation with intense pre&#8208;edge transition. This finding may broaden the scope of models considered for the structure of high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.

         <title>Reduction of Sulfur Dioxide to Sulfur Monoxide by Ferrous Porphyrin
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SO2 could be reduced to SO by an iron porphyrin via a [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ intermediate. This intermediate, which is proposed to be involved in sulfite reductase enzymes, has not been observed outside the protein matrix previously and was characterized by EPR, Mossbauer and resonance Raman spectroscopy. The SO formed could be transferred to an organic diene through a cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
The reduction of SO2 to fixed forms of sulfur can address the growing concerns regarding its detrimental effect on health and the environment as well as enable its valorization into valuable chemicals. The naturally occurring heme enzyme sulfite reductase (SiR) is known to reduce SO2 to H2S and is an integral part of the global sulfur cycle. However, its action has not yet been mimicked in artificial systems outside of the protein matrix even after several decades of structural elucidation of the enzyme. While the coordination of SO2 to transition metals is documented, its reduction using molecular catalysts has remained elusive. Herein reduction of SO2 by iron(II) tetraphenylporphyrin is demonstrated. A combination of spectroscopic data backed up by theoretical calculations indicate that FeIITPP reduces SO2 by 2e&#8722;/2H+ to form an intermediate [FeIII&#8722;SO]+ species, also proposed for SiR, which releases SO. The SO obtained from the chemical reduction of SO2 could be evidenced in the form of a cheletropic adduct of butadiene resulting in an organic sulfoxide.

         <title>Facilitated Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aerobic Environment on a Copper&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After aerobic pretreatment, the MOF node of the hybrid catalyst was hydroxylated and exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4. Intriguingly, the addition of 20&#8201;% O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; rather, a fivefold increase was found when compared to the lack of O2.







Abstract
Herein, we fabricated a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking hybrid photocatalyst by combining two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: g&#8208;C3N4 and a Cu&#8208;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). After an aerobic photocatalytic pretreatment, this hybrid catalyst exhibited an unprecedented ability to photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO and CH4 under the typical level (20&#8201;%) of O2 in the air. Intriguingly, the presence of O2 did not suppress CO2 reduction; instead, a fivefold increase compared with that in the absence of O2 was observed. Structural analysis indicated that during aerobic pretreatment, the Cu node in the 2D&#8208;MOF moiety was hydroxylated by the hydroxyl generated from the reduction of O2. Then the formed hydroxylated Cu node maintained its structure during aerobic CO2 reduction, whereas it underwent structural alteration and was reductively devitalized in the absence of O2. Theoretical calculations further demonstrated that CO2 reduction, instead of O2 reduction, occurred preferentially on the hydroxylated Cu node.

         <title>Accelerated Transfer and Spillover of Carbon Monoxide through Tandem Catalysis for Kinetics&#8208;boosted Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique *CO transfer and spillover strategy was developed by fabricating Ni single atom supported on pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon as a *CO donor for feeding Cu NPs with *CO, boosting the coverage of *CO on Cu NPs and subsequently improving the selectivity for CO2&#8208;C2H4 conversion.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been widely applied in electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to produce multicarbon (C2+) feedstocks (e.g., C2H4). However, the high energy barriers for CO2 activation on the Cu surface is a challenge for a high catalytic efficiency and product selectivity. Herein, we developed an in situ *CO generation and spillover strategy by engineering single Ni atoms on a pyridinic N&#8208;enriched carbon support with a sodalite (SOD) topology (Ni&#8208;SOD/NC) that acted as a donor to feed adjacent Cu nanoparticles (NPs) with *CO intermediate. As a result, a high C2H4 selectivity of 62.5&#8201;% and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 160&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of &#8722;0.72&#8197;V were achieved. Our studies revealed that the isolated NiN3 active sites with adjacent pyridinic N species facilitated the *CO desorption and the massive *CO intermediate released from Ni&#8208;SOD/NC then overflowed to Cu NPs surface to enrich the *CO coverage for improving the selectivity of CO2ER to C2H4.

         <title>On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphaalumenes react with alkynes and alkenes. Depending on the steric profile of the alkyne either 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes in a formal [2+2] cycloaddition or zwitterionic 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes through threefold insertion into the Al&#8722;P bond are obtained. With alkenes 1,2&#8208;phosphalumates and 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes are obtained. Computational studies corroborate the contrasting pathways and underline the role of the aluminum center.







Abstract
Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe3 gave 1,4&#8208;phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2&#8208;phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio&#8208;isomers of 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4&#8208;aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3&#8208;butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized. The experimental work is supported by theoretical studies to shed light on the mechanism governing the formation of these heterocycles.

     alt="On the Reactivity of Phosphaalumenes towards C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphaalumenes react with alkynes and alkenes. Depending on the steric profile of the alkyne either 1,2-phosphaalumetes in a formal [2+2] cycloaddition or zwitterionic 1,4-phosphaaluminabarrelenes through threefold insertion into the Al&#8722;P bond are obtained. With alkenes 1,2-phosphalumates and 1,4-aluminaphosphorinanes are obtained. Computational studies corroborate the contrasting pathways and underline the role of the aluminum center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterocycles containing group 13 and 15 elements such as borazines are an integral part of organic, biomedical and materials chemistry. Surprisingly, heterocycles containing P and Al are rare. We have now utilized phosphaalumenes in reactions with alkynes, alkenes and conjugated double bond systems. With sterically demanding alkynes 1,2-phosphaalumetes were afforded, whereas the reaction with HCCH or HCCSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gave 1,4-phosphaaluminabarrelenes. Using styrene saturated 1,2-phosphaalumates were formed, which reacted further with additional styrene to give different regio-isomers of 1,4-aluminaphosphorinanes. Using ethylene, a 1,4-aluminaphosphorinane is obtained, while with 1,3-butadiene a bicyclic system containing an aluminacyclopentane and a phosphirane unit was synthesized. The experimental work is supported by theoretical studies to shed light on the mechanism governing the formation of these heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A &#8220;Pre&#8208;Division Metal Clusters&#8221; Strategy to Mediate Efficient Dual&#8208;Active Sites ORR Catalyst for Ultralong Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is first conceived to fabricate dual&#8208;active center catalysts (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500) with dispersed CoN4 and Co2P sites. The optimal catalyst executes superior ORR activity and applies in ultralong Zn&#8208;air batteries surpassing the benchmark 20&#8201;% Pt/C. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the dual&#8208;active sits synergistically quicken the formation energy of *OOH intermediate, greatly boosting the performance.







Abstract
To conquer the bottleneck of sluggish kinetics in cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of metal&#8208;air batteries, catalysts with dual&#8208;active centers have stood out. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;division metal clusters&#8221; strategy is firstly conceived to fabricate a N,S&#8208;dual doped honeycomb&#8208;like carbon matrix inlaid with CoN4 sites and wrapped Co2P nanoclusters as dual&#8208;active centers (Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500). A crystalline {CoII2} coordination cluster divided by periphery second organic layers is well&#8208;designed to realize delocalized dispersion before calcination. The optimal Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500 executes excellent 4e&#8722; ORR activity surpassing the benchmark Pt/C. Theoretical calculation results reveal that the CoN4 sites and Co2P nanoclusters can synergistically quicken the formation of *OOH on Co sites. The rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) assembled by Co2P/CoN4@NSC&#8208;500 delivers ultralong cycling stability over 1742&#8197;hours (3484&#8197;cycles) under 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can light up a 2.4&#8197;V LED bulb for &#8776;264&#8197;hours, evidencing the promising practical application potentials in portable devices.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yields in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Antimony (III) Chlorides with the [SbCl5] Geometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five pairs of antimony chlorides have been synthesized via two synthetic conditions to produce distinctively different structures and PL properties. The A2SbCl5 types with square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry and near&#8208;unity PLQY can be synthesized via diffusion method in DMF. Alternatively, when growing via solution method in HCl, the non&#8208;emissive A2Sb2Cl8 types with seesaw dimmer geometry are obtained.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic antimony halides have attracted increasing attention due to the non&#8208;toxicity, stability, and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). To shed light on the structural factors that contribute to the high PLQY, five pairs of antimony halides with general formula A2SbCl5 and A2Sb2Cl8 are synthesized via two distinct methods and characterized. The A2SbCl5 type adopts square pyramidal [SbCl5] geometry with near&#8208;unity PLQY, while the A2Sb2Cl8 adopts seesaw dimmer [Sb2Cl8] geometry with PLQY&#8776;0&#8201;%. Through combined data analysis with the literature, we have found that A2SbCl5 series with square pyramidal geometry generally has much longer Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb distances, leading to more expressed lone pairs of SbIII. Additional factors including Sb&#8722;Cl distance and stability of antimony chlorides may also affect PLQY. Our targeted synthesis and correlated insights provide efficient tools to precisely form highly emissive materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Catalytic Method for the Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Ketones, &#945;&#8208;Ketoesters and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of versatile &#945;&#8208;quaternary acyclic ketones, &#945;&#8208;ketoesters, and aldehydes, by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles. Transformations employ simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a chiral phosphine, and generate a broad range of products bearing difficult to access dialkyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters in good yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A practical method for the efficient and enantioselective preparation of versatile ketones and aldehydes that contain an &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter is described. Reactions utilize simple carboxylic acid or ester starting materials, a monodentate chiral phosphine, and afford a variety of aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and alkyl&#8208;substituted ketone and aldehyde products in 25&#8211;94&#8201;% yield and 90&#8201;:&#8201;10 to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio. Reactions proceed by acyl substitution with in situ formed chiral allylic nucleophiles, and display selectivity and conversion dependence on a protic additive. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through several product transformations.

         <title>Fully Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 Complex: Strong Cu&#8208;Cu interaction and Fast Electron Self&#8208;Exchange Rate Despite Large Structural Changes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicopper complexes in the CuICuI and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 states have been synthesized and comprehensively characterized, revealing a high delocalization energy of the mixed&#8208;valent species comparable with the biological CuA site. Fast electron self&#8208;exchange is suggested to occur via a sequential ET pathway, involving an active conformational isomer of the flexible CuICuI species, pointing to a potential gating scenario for ET.







Abstract
A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, CuICuI (1) and mixed&#8208;valent Cu1.5Cu1.5 (2). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV/Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD&#8208;DFT and CASSCF calculations. 2 features a short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu distance (&#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197;; compared to &#8776;4.0&#8197;&#197; in 1) and a very high delocalization energy of 13&#8201;000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, comparable to the mixed&#8208;valent state of the biological CuA site. Electron self&#8208;exchange between 1 and 2 is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of 1, viz. 1&#8242;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self&#8208;exchange closely related to the function of the CuA site.

&lt;p&gt;A flexible macrocyclic ligand with two tridentate {CNC} compartments can host two Cu ions in reversibly interconvertible states, Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;1.5&lt;/sup&gt;Cu&lt;sup&gt;1.5&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). They were characterized by XRD and multiple spectroscopic methods, including EPR, UV/Vis absorption and MCD, in combination with TD-DFT and CASSCF calculations. &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; features a short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cu distance (&#8776;2.5&#8197;&#197;; compared to &#8776;4.0&#8197;&#197; in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and a very high delocalization energy of 13&#8201;000&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to the mixed-valent state of the biological Cu&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; site. Electron self-exchange between &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is rapid despite large structural reorganization, and is proposed to proceed via a sequential mechanism involving an active conformer of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, viz. &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt;; the latter has been characterized by XRD. Such electron transfer (ET) process is reminiscent of the conformationally gated ET proposed for biological systems. This redox couple is a unique pair of flexible dicopper complexes, achieving fast electron self-exchange closely related to the function of the Cu&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double Asymmetric Core Optimizes Crystal Packing to Enable Selenophene&#8208;based Acceptor with Over 18&#8201;% Efficiency in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A type double asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were synthesized by a n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl regioisomeric strategy to optimize single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance. PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl achieved a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl.







Abstract
Side&#8208;chain tailoring is a promising method to optimize the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, asymmetric alkyl chain&#8208;based small molecular acceptors (SMAs) are still difficult to afford. Herein, we adopted a novel asymmetric n&#8208;nonyl/undecyl substitution strategy and synthesized two A&#8208;D1A&#8242;D2&#8208;A double asymmetric isomeric SMAs with asymmetric selenophene&#8208;based central core for OSCs. Crystallographic analysis indicates that AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl forms a more compact and order intermolecular packing compared to AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl, which contributed to higher electron mobility in neat AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl film. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl blend film shows a better morphology with appropriate phase separation and distinct face&#8208;on orientation than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl. The OSCs with PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT9Se11&#8208;Cl obtain a superior PCE of 18.12&#8201;% compared to PM6&#8201;:&#8201;AYT11Se9&#8208;Cl (17.52&#8201;%), which is the best efficiency for the selenium&#8208;incorporated SMAs in binary BHJ OSCs. Our findings elucidate that the promising double asymmetric strategy with isomeric alkyl chains precisely modulates the crystal packing and enhances the photovoltaic efficiency of selenophene&#8208;incorporated SMAs.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Energy Storage Devices: Novel Benzothiadiazole Functionalized Two&#8208;Dimensional Olefin&#8208;Linked COFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COFs exhibit an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We shed light onto the charge&#8208;storage mechanism through the benzothiadiazole units in the COFs electrodes via computational and experimental analyses.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials for energy storage applications exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance. While most of the reported organic cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion batteries use carbonyl groups as electrochemically&#8208;active sites, their high hydrophilicity in aqueous electrolytes represents a critical drawback. Herein, we report a novel and structurally robust olefin&#8208;linked COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT synthesized via the aldol condensation between 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)dibenzaldehyde (BT), where benzothiadiazole units are explored as novel electrochemically&#8208;active groups. Our COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT exhibits an outstanding Zn2+ storage capability, delivering a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art capacity of 283.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the charge&#8208;storage mechanism in COF&#8208;TMT&#8208;BT electrodes is based on the supramolecularly engineered and reversible Zn2+ coordination by the benzothiadiazole units.

Herein, the new conjugated units, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs) were designed and synthesized. By fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good optoelectronic integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and especially the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence was obtained.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is of great significance for the fabrication of miniaturized optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting transistors. However, great challenge exists in designing key materials, especially those who integrates triplet exciton utilization ability. Herein, dinaphthylanthracene diimides (DNADIs), with 2,6&#8208;extended anthracene donor, and 3&#8242;&#8208; or 4&#8242;&#8208;substituted naphthalene monoimide acceptors were designed and synthesized. By introducing acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor structure, both materials show high electron mobility. Moreover, by fine&#8208;tuning of substitution sites, good integration with high solid state photoluminescence quantum yield of 26&#8201;%, high electron mobility of 0.02&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the feature of hot&#8208;exciton induced delayed fluorescence were obtained in 4&#8242;&#8208;DNADI. This work opens a new avenue for developing high electron mobility emissive organic semiconductors with efficient utilization of triplet excitons.

         <title>Ultramicroporous Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with Functionality Pair for Membrane C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) with ultramicroporous structure and paired functionalities is designed and synthesized. This COF is exfoliated into large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets, enabling the fabrication of compatible hybrid membranes. The COF membranes exhibit superior acetylene/ethylene separation with high selectivity and large permeability owing to collaborative acetylene recognition and gas&#8208;transport highways.







Abstract
Gas separation efficiency of covalent organic framework (COF) membrane can be greatly elevated through precise functionalization. A pair&#8208;functionalized COF membrane of 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and isoquinoline&#8208;5,8&#8208;diamine (IQD) monomers in two and three nodes is designed and synthesized. TP&#8208;IQD is crystallized in a two&#8208;dimensional structure with a pore size of 6.5&#8197;&#197; and a surface area of 289&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. This COF possesses N&#8722;O paired groups which cooperatively interact with C2H2 instead of C2H4. TP&#8208;IQD nanosheets of &#8776;10&#8197;&#956;m in width and &#8776;4&#8197;nm in thickness are prepared by mechanical exfoliation; they are further processed with 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer into a hybrid membrane. High porosity and functionality pair of TP&#8208;IQD offer the membrane with significantly increased C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity which are 160&#8201;% and 430&#8201;% higher of pure 6FDA&#8208;ODA. The boosted performance demonstrates high efficiency of the pair&#8208;functionality strategy for the synthesis of separation&#8208;led COFs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas separation efficiency of covalent organic framework (COF) membrane can be greatly elevated through precise functionalization. A pair-functionalized COF membrane of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TP) and isoquinoline-5,8-diamine (IQD) monomers in two and three nodes is designed and synthesized. TP-IQD is crystallized in a two-dimensional structure with a pore size of 6.5&#8197;&#197; and a surface area of 289&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This COF possesses N&#8722;O paired groups which cooperatively interact with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. TP-IQD nanosheets of &#8776;10&#8197;&#956;m in width and &#8776;4&#8197;nm in thickness are prepared by mechanical exfoliation; they are further processed with 6FDA-ODA polymer into a hybrid membrane. High porosity and functionality pair of TP-IQD offer the membrane with significantly increased C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity which are 160&#8201;% and 430&#8201;% higher of pure 6FDA-ODA. The boosted performance demonstrates high efficiency of the pair-functionality strategy for the synthesis of separation-led COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of Isomeric Naphthalene&#8208;Based 2D Kagome Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted synthesis of two isomeric naphthalene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with Kagome topology is realized by rational design of isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different length of substituents. The specific pore structures of the two isomeric frameworks result in a significant difference in spatial immobilization of C60 guests. Incorporation of C60 into m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF increases the photoconductivity of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, presumably due to the enhanced charge transfer effect.







Abstract
Targeted synthesis of kagome (kgm) topologic 2D covalent organic frameworks remains challenging, presumably due to the severe dependence on building units and synthetic conditions. Herein, two isomeric &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomers with different lengths of substituted arms based on naphthalene core (p&#8208;Naph and m&#8208;Naph) are elaborately designed and utilized for the defined synthesis of isomeric kgm Naph&#8208;COFs. The two isomeric frameworks exhibit splendid crystallinity and showcase the same chemical composition and topologic structure with, however, different pore channels. Interestingly, C60 is able to uniformly be encapsulated into the triangle channels of m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF via in situ incorporation method, while not the isomeric p&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF, likely due to the different pore structures of the two isomeric COFs. The resulting stable C60@m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF composite exhibits much higher photoconductivity than the m&#8208;Naph&#8208;COF owing to charge transfer between the conjugated skeletons and C60 guests.

         <title>Sustainable Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxycarboxylic Acids by Manganese Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Primary Alcohols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis of highly demanded &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acids via dehydrogenative coupling of two feedstock chemicals, ethylene glycol, and primary alcohols, is reported. An Earth's abundant metal complex catalyzes the reaction with high yields and selectivities. Water and hydrogen gas are produced as the sole byproducts.







Abstract
Herein, we report a straightforward synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylic acid molecules via an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethylene glycol and primary alcohols. A bench&#8208;stable manganese complex catalyzed the reaction, which is scalable, with the product being isolated with high yields and selectivities under mild conditions. The protocol is environmentally benign, producing water and hydrogen gas as the only byproducts. Methanol can also be used as a C1 source for producing the platform molecule lactic acid, with a high turnover of &gt;104. The methodology was also used to functionalize alcohols derived from natural products and fatty acids. Furthermore, it was applied for synthesizing &#945;&#8208;amino acid, &#945;&#8208;thiocarboxylic acid, and several drugs and bioactive molecules, including endogenous metabolites, Danshensu, Enalapril, Lisinopril, and Rosmarinic acid. Preliminary mechanistic studies were performed to shed light on the mechanism involved in the reaction.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse Reaction of Azide&#8208;Ynamides via &#945;&#8208;Imino Copper Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse of azide&#8208;ynamides via &#945;&#8208;imino copper carbenes is disclosed, enabling the practical and divergent assembly of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This protocol represents the first asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and the first asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.







Abstract
[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8211;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.

         <title>Synchronous Dual Electrolyte Additive Sustains Zn Metal Anode with 5600&#8197;h Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchronous dual electrolyte additive sustains reversible Zn metal anode: A dual electrolyte additive strategy is developed via the direct addition of xylitol and graphene oxide species into common zinc sulfate electrolyte. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be readily obtained under the synergistic additive regulation, thus enabling a dense and uniform deposition with a lifespan of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Despite conspicuous merits of Zn metal anodes, the commercialization is still handicapped by rampant dendrite formation and notorious side reaction. Manipulating the nucleation mode and deposition orientation of Zn is a key to rendering stabilized Zn anodes. Here, a dual electrolyte additive strategy is put forward via the direct cooperation of xylitol (XY) and graphene oxide (GO) species into typical zinc sulfate electrolyte. As verified by molecular dynamics simulations, the incorporated XY molecules could regulate the solvation structure of Zn2+, thus inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. The self&#8208;assembled GO layer is in favor of facilitating the desolvation process to accelerate reaction kinetics. Progressive nucleation and orientational deposition can be realized under the synergistic modulation, enabling a dense and uniform Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetric cell based on dual additives harvests a highly reversible cycling of 5600&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Generation of Allylmagnesium Reagents by Hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium hydride, generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride and magnesium iodide in tetrahydrofuran, was found capable of inducing regio and stereocontrolled hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes to form allylmagnesium species. Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium species with various electrophiles provided synthetically valuable synthons such as homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes.







Abstract
A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated in situ by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.

         <title>Realizing Textured Zinc Metal Anodes through Regulating Electrodeposition Current for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (002) plane textured Zn metal is realized by using a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy in a low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 aqueous electrolyte. Increasing the current density not only accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei but also boosts the growth rate of (100) crystal plane, thus enabling the final exposure of (002) surface for Zn electrodeposits.







Abstract
Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.

         <title>Halide Layer Cathodes for Compatible and Fast&#8208;charged Halides&#8208;based All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insertion&#8208;type compounds based on oxides and sulfides have been widely identified and well&#8208;studied as cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, halides have rarely been used due to their high solubility in organic liquid electrolytes. Here, we reveal the insertion electrochemistry of VX3 (X&#8201;=&#8201;Cl, Br, I) by introducing a compatible halide solid&#8208;state electrolyte with a wide electrochemical stability window. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure analyses reveal a two&#8208;step lithiation process and the structural transition of typical VCl3. Fast Li+ insertion/extraction in the layered VX3 active materials and favorable interface guaranteed by the compatible electrode&#8208;electrolyte design enables high rate capability and stable operation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;VX3 batteries. The findings from this study will contribute to developing intercalation insertion electrochemistry of halide materials and exploring novel electrode materials in viable energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state in chromophoric pair (DC&#8208;PDI2) that uniquely integrates the advantages of fundamental processes of photosynthetic reaction centers i) Symmetry&#8208;breaking charge&#8208;separation and ii) Marcus inverted&#8208;region dependence. The near&#8208;orthogonal bichromophoric DC&#8208;PDI2 manifests ultrafast evolution of the SB&#8208;CS state with a time constant of &#964;SB&#8208;CS&#160;= 0.35&#177;0.02 ps and slow charge recombination (CR) kinetics with &#964;CR= 4.09&#177;0.01 ns in ACN. The rate constant of CR of DC&#8208;PDI2 is 11686 times slower than SB&#8208;CS in ACN, as the CR of PDI radical ion&#8208;pair occurs in the deep inverted region of Marcus parabola ( [[EQUATION]] &gt;&#955;). While an analogous benzyloxy (BnO)&#8208;substituted DC&#8208;BPDI2 showcases ~10&#8208;fold accelerated CR kinetics with &#964;CR/&#964;SB&#8208;CS&#160;lowering to ~1538 in ACN, by virtue of decreased CR driving force.

         <title>Dynamic Lone Pair Expression as Chemical Bonding Origin of Giant Phonon Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Loosely bonded (&#8220;rattling&#8221;) atoms with s2 lone pair electrons are usually associated with strong anharmonicity and unexpectedly low thermal conductivity, yet their detailed correlation remains largely unknown. Here we resolve this correlation in thermoelectric InTe by combining chemical bonding analysis, inelastic X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering, and first principles phonon calculations. We successfully probe soft low&#8208;lying transverse phonons dominated by large In1+ z&#8208;axis motions, and their giant anharmonicity. We show that the highly anharmonic phonons arise from the dynamic lone pair expression with unstable occupied antibonding states induced by the covalency between delocalized In1+ 5s2 lone pair electrons and Te 5p states. This work pinpoints the microscopic origin of strong anharmonicity driven by rattling atoms with stereochemical lone pair activity, important for designing efficient materials for thermoelectric energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Aryl Halides at Gold(I) by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: L&#8208;Shaped Heterobidentate ImPy (Imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;ylidene) N,C Ligands for Oxidant&#8208;Free Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogenous gold catalysis. However, Au(I)/Au(III) catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of Au(I) to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the Au(III) intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy = imidazo[1,5&#8208;&#945;]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;&#8208;donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for Au(I)/Au(III) redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogenous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogenous gold catalysis. However, Au(I)/Au(III) catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of Au(I) to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the Au(III) intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L-shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy = imidazo[1,5-&#945;]pyridin-3-ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;-donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for Au(I)/Au(III) redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogenous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macromolecular Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macromolecular information transfer can be defined as the process by which a coded monomer sequence is communicated from one macromolecule to another. In such a transfer process, the information sequence can be kept identical, transformed into a complementary sequence or even translated into a different molecular language. Such mechanisms are crucial in biology and take place in DNA&#8594;DNA replication, DNA&#8594;RNA transcription and RNA&#8594;protein translation. In fact, there would be no life on Earth without macromolecular information transfer. Mimicking such processes with synthetic macromolecules would also be of major scientific relevance because it would open up new avenues for technological applications (e.g. data storage and processing) but also for the creation of artificial life. In this important context, this minireview summarizes recent research about information transfer in synthetic oligomers and polymers. Medium&#8208; and long&#8208;term perspectives are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasonication&#8208;Induced Strong Metal&#8722;Support Interaction Construction in H2O Towards Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of facile methodologies to afford robust supported metal nanocatalysts under mild conditions is highly desirable yet challenging, particularly via strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) construction.  State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches capable of generating SMSI encapsulation mainly focus on high temperature annealing in reductive/oxidative atmosphere.  Herein,  ultra&#8208;stable metal nanocatalysts based on SMSI construction were produced by leveraging the instantaneous high&#8208;energy input from ultrasonication under ambient conditions in H  2  O, which could rapidly afford abundant active intermediates, Ti  3+  ions, and oxygen vacancies within the scaffolds to induce the SMSI overlayer formation. The encapsulation degree could be tuned and controlled via reducibility of the solvents and the ultrasonication parameters. This facile and efficient approach could be further extended to diverse metal oxide supports and noble metal NPs leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation reactions and CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Siloxane Bond Exchanges: from a Molecular Study to vitrimerization and recycling of Silicone Elastomers.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activity of various additives promoting siloxane equilibration reactions is examined and quantified on model compounds.&#160; We found in particular that the &#8220;superbase&#8221; phosphazene derivative P4&#8208;tBu &#160;can promote very fast exchanges (a few seconds at 90 &#176;C) even at low concentration (&lt;0.1 wt%). We demonstrate that permanent silicone networks can be transformed into reprocessable and recyclable dynamic networks by mere introduction of such additives. Annealing at high temperature degrades the additives and deactivates the dynamic features of the silicone networks, reverting them back into permanent networks. A simple rheological experiment and the corresponding model allow to extract the critical kinetic parameters to predict and control such deactivations.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Transition&#8208;Metal Migration in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes: Random Na Extraction and Na&#8208;Free Layer Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs).&#160;Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na&#8208;free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru&#8208;contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na&#8208;free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Superstructures for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8722;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With fast (de)coordination kinetics, the smallest and the lightest proton stands out as the most ideal charge carrier for aqueous Zn&#8722;organic batteries (ZOBs). Hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks with rapid Grotthuss proton conduction is particularly suitable for organic cathodes, yet not reported. We report the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of cyanuric acid and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triamine into organic superstructures through in&#8208;plane H&#8208;bonds and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The supramolecular superstructures exhibit highly stable lock&#8208;and&#8208;key H&#8208;bonding networks with an ultralow activation energy for protonation (0.09 eV vs. 0.25 eV of zincification). Then, high&#8208;kinetics H+ coordination is prior to Zn2+ into protophilic C=O sites via a two&#8208;step nine&#8208;electron reaction. The assembled ZOBs show high&#8208;rate capability (135 mAh g&#8722;1 at 150 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (267 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and ultra&#8208;long life (50,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1), becoming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZOBs in comprehensive performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomolecular click reactions using a minimal pH&#8208;activated Catcher/Tag pair for producing native&#8208;sized spider&#8208;silk proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A type of protein/peptide pair known as Catcher/Tag pair spontaneously forms an intermolecular isopeptide bond which can be applied for biomolecular click reactions. Covalent protein conjugation using Catcher/Tag pairs has turned out to be a valuable tool in biotechnology and biomedicines, but it is essential to increase the current toolbox of orthogonal Catcher/Tag pairs to expand the range of applications further, for example, for controlled multiple&#8208;fragment ligation. We report here the engineering of novel Catcher/Tag pairs for protein ligation, aided by a crystal structure of a minimal CnaB domain from Lactobacillus plantarum. We show that a newly engineered pair, called SilkCatcher/Tag enables efficient pH&#8208;inducible protein ligation in addition to being compatible with the widely used SpyCatcher/Tag pair. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the SilkCatcher/Tag pair in the production of native&#8208;sized highly repetitive spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like proteins with &gt;90% purity, which is not possible by traditional recombinant production methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Quadruple Catenation of Giant Chiral [8+12] Salicylimine Cubes Driven by Weak Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked structures are fascinating synthetic targets and the topological complexity achieved through catenation offers numerous possibilities for the construction of new molecules with exciting properties. In the structural space of catenated organic cage molecules, only few examples have been realized so far, and control over the catenation process in solution is still barely achieved. Herein, we describe the formation of a quadruply interlocked catenane of giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes. The formation could be controlled by the choice of solvent used in the reaction. The interlocked structure was unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and weak hydrogen bonding was identified as a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments using partially deuterated cages were performed, revealing that the catenane formation occurs through mechanical interlocking of preformed single cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric Extracellular Matrix Nanoremodeler for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer immunotherapy has shown potential to train the intrinsic immune system against malignancy. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment forms a formidable barrier to restrict the penetration of therapeutic drugs and prevent the infiltration of immune cells. We herein report a semiconducting polymer&#8208;based ECM nanoremodeler (SPNcb) for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy, which has photodynamic antitumor activity and cancer&#8208;specific inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes (LOX: lysyl oxidase). SPNcb is an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer conjugated with a LOX inhibitor (&#946;&#8208;aminopropionitrile, BAPN) via a cancer biomarker&#8208;cleavable segment. BAPN can be released from SPNcb and activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the cancer biomarker, blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Nickel Thiolate Complexes for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to C1&#8211;3 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bioinspired molecular nickel thiolate complexes exhibit impressive electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction on carbon paper, with a Faradaic efficiency of 41&#8201;% for hydrocarbons. C3 hydrocarbons were reported for the first time from molecular complexes.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented electrocatalytic activity of a series of molecular nickel thiolate complexes (1&#8211;5) in reducing CO2 to C1&#8211;3 hydrocarbons on carbon paper in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous solutions. Ni(mpo)2 (3, mpo=2&#8208;mercaptopyridyl&#8208;N&#8208;oxide), Ni(pyS)3&#8722; (4, pyS=2&#8208;mercaptopyridine), and Ni(mp)2&#8722; (5, mp=2&#8208;mercaptophenolate) were found to generate C3 products from CO2 for the first time in molecular complex. Compound 5 exhibits Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 10.6&#8201;%, 7.2&#8201;%, 8.2&#8201;% for C1, C2, C3 hydrocarbons respectively at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Addition of CO to the system significantly promotes the FEC1&#8211;C3 to 41.1&#8201;%, suggesting that a key Ni&#8722;CO intermediate is associated with catalysis. A variety of spectroscopies have been performed to show that the structures of nickel complexes remain intact during CO2 reduction.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;ion Mobility in Li6B18(Li3N) and Li Vacancy Tuning in the Solid Solution Li6B18(Li3N)1&#8722;x(Li2O)x</title>

         <dc:description>
A new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure is reported. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 
Li7N] strands. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries are promising candidates for safe energy&#8208;storage systems due to non&#8208;flammable solid electrolytes and the possibility to use metallic lithium as an anode. Thus, there is a challenge to design new solid electrolytes and to understand the principles of ion conduction on an atomic scale. We report on a new concept for compounds with high lithium ion mobility based on a rigid open&#8208;framework boron structure. The host&#8211;guest structure Li6B18(Li3N) comprises large hexagonal pores filled with 
Li7N] strands that represent a perfect cutout from the structure of &#945;&#8208;Li3N. Variable&#8208;temperature 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy reveals a very high Li mobility in the template phase with a remarkably low activation energy below 19&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and thus much lower than pristine Li3N. The formation of the solid solution of Li6B18(Li3N) and Li6B18(Li2O) over the complete compositional range allows the tuning of lithium defects in the template structure that is not possible for pristine Li3N and Li2O.

         <title>Designing High&#8208;Donicity Anions for Rechargeable Potassium Superoxide/Peroxide Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following the concept of &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; design, the asymmetric anion (MPSA&#8722;) with high donicity was synthesized and validated to boost the reversibility of potassium superoxide/peroxide redox without any electrocatalysts. Such anions could effectively retard the electrode passivation with enhanced discharge capacity and facilitate the K2O2 decomposition out of the substrate.







Abstract
A battery cathode based on the superoxide/peroxide redox not only inherits the advantage of oxygen (O2) batteries in high capacities and low costs but also overcomes the disadvantages in O2 storage, electrolyte evaporation, and anode deactivation due to O2 crossover. Herein, we report an enhanced potassium superoxide (KO2)/peroxide (K2O2) conversion by adopting a high&#8208;donicity anion additive in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Such an anion was synthesized via a &#8220;Solvent&#8208;in&#8208;Anion&#8221; strategy and validated to enhance the electron donicity of the electrolyte. The use of high&#8208;donicity anion could lead to enhanced KO2 utilization (&#8776;90.2&#8201;%) by retarding electrode passivation and allow the full charging back of K2O2 through the solution&#8208;mediated pathway without electrocatalysts. No apparent cell degradation is observed during the first 120&#8197;cycles by controlling the reversible depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge capacity at 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1
 within an O2&#8208;free region. The K&#8722;KO2 cell delivers a high energy efficiency (&gt;84.4&#8201;%) and a lifespan of over 1440&#8197;hours.

Such anions could effectively retard the electrode passivation with enhanced discharge capacity and facilitate the K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition out of the substrate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A battery cathode based on the superoxide/peroxide redox not only inherits the advantage of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries in high capacities and low costs but also overcomes the disadvantages in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage, electrolyte evaporation, and anode deactivation due to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crossover. Herein, we report an enhanced potassium superoxide (KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/peroxide (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) conversion by adopting a high-donicity anion additive in the ether-based electrolyte. Such an anion was synthesized via a &#8220;Solvent-in-Anion&#8221; strategy and validated to enhance the electron donicity of the electrolyte. The use of high-donicity anion could lead to enhanced KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization (&#8776;90.2&#8201;%) by retarding electrode passivation and allow the full charging back of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the solution-mediated pathway without electrocatalysts. No apparent cell degradation is observed during the first 120&#8197;cycles by controlling the reversible depth-of-discharge capacity at 292&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
 within an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free region. The K&#8722;KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell delivers a high energy efficiency (&amp;gt;84.4&#8201;%) and a lifespan of over 1440&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Incorporated Sn Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our work, a facile hydrolysis method was developed to synthesize halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalysts. The introduction and retention of halogen dopants were verified by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn and as a result promoted CO2RR to formate, while suppressing the competing CO2RR to CO and HER.







Abstract
Electrochemically reducing CO2 to valuable fuels or feedstocks is recognized as a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the crises of fossil fuel shortage and carbon emission. Sn&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to make formic acid/formate, which unfortunately still suffer from low activity, selectivity and stability. In this work, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was introduced into the Sn catalyst by a facile hydrolysis method. The presence of halogen was confirmed by a collection of ex situ and in situ characterizations, which rendered a more positive valence state of Sn in halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst as compared to unmodified Sn under cathodic potentials in CO2RR and therefore tuned the adsorption strength of the key intermediate (*OCHO) toward formate formation. As a result, the halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2RR to produce formate.

         <title>Fast Li&#8208;ion Storage and Dynamics in TiO2 Nanoparticle Clusters Probed by Smart Scanning Electrochemical Cell Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (s&#8208;SECCM), achieved through in situ interference reflection microscopy, enables the high throughput analysis of individual TiO2 nanoparticle clusters to estimate the Li+ diffusivity and reveal the inherent fast charging capability of small TiO2 nanoparticle clusters.







Abstract
Anatase TiO2 is a promising material for Li&#8208;ion (Li+) batteries with fast charging capability. However, Li+ (de)intercalation dynamics in TiO2 remain elusive and reported diffusivities span many orders of magnitude. Here, we develop a smart protocol for scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) with in situ optical microscopy (OM) to enable the high&#8208;throughput charge/discharge analysis of single TiO2 nanoparticle clusters. Directly probing active nanoparticles revealed that TiO2 with a size of &#8776;50&#8197;nm can store over 30&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity at an extremely fast charge/discharge rate of &#8776;100&#8197;C. This finding of fast Li+ storage in TiO2 particles strengthens its potential for fast&#8208;charging batteries. More generally, smart SECCM&#8208;OM should find wide applications for high&#8208;throughput electrochemical screening of nanostructured materials.

         <title>&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Heteroarylation of Free Carboxylic Acids: A Modular Synthetic Platform for Diverse Quaternary Carbon Centers</title>

         <dc:description>
We report the first catalytic example of PdII&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;selective &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H aza&#8208;heteroarylation of free carboxylic acids. A sequence of three consecutive mono&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation reactions of pivalic acid provides an unique platform for constructing diverse quaternary carbon centers containing heteroaryls which could serve as an enabling tool for escaping the flat land in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
PdII&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of free carboxylic acids represents a significant advance from conventional cyclopalladation initiated reactions. However, developing a modular synthetic platform for diverse quaternary and tertiary carbon centers based on this reactivity, two challenges remain to be addressed: mono&#8208;selectivity in each consecutive C&#8722;H functionalization step; compatibility with heteroatoms. While the exclusive mono&#8208;selectivity was achieved by &#946;&#8208;lactonization/nucleophilic attack, the latter limitation remains to be overcome. Herein, we report the PdII&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H heteroarylation of free carboxylic acids using pyridine&#8208;pyridone ligands capable of overcoming these limitations.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed ortho&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Amides Enabled by 5&#8208;Trifluoromethylated Bipyridine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mere introduction of a CF3 group at position&#8197;5 of a bipyridine ligand promotes a dramatic change in regioselectivity in the iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylation of benzamides and derivatives, from meta/para to ortho&#8208;substitution. Computational and experimental data suggest that this effect is associated to unusual outer&#8208;sphere dispersion interactions between the carbonyl group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;bipy ring of the ligand.







Abstract
Iridium&#8208;catalyzed borylations of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds are highly attractive transformations because of the diversification possibilities offered by the resulting boronates. These transformations are best carried out using bidentate bipyridine or phenanthroline ligands, and tend to be governed by steric factors, therefore resulting in the competitive functionalization of meta and/or para positions. We have now discovered that a subtle change in the bipyridine ligand, namely, the introduction of a CF3 substituent at position&#8197;5, enables a complete change of regioselectivity in the borylation of aromatic amides, allowing the synthesis of a wide variety of ortho&#8208;borylated derivatives. Importantly, thorough computational studies suggest that the exquisite regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity stems from unusual outer&#8208;sphere interactions between the amide group of the substrate and the CF3&#8208;substituted aryl ring of the bipyridine ligand.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BODIPY&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with blood&#8208;brain barrier crossing ability for imaging oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain was designed. The probe shows reversible and ratiometric response behavior to oxidative stress. In vivo studies reveal the great potential of the probe in photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration diseases.

Spatiotemporal assessment of the oxidative stress dynamics in the brain is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing oxidative stress probes have poor blood&#8208;brain barrier permeability or poor penetration depth, making them unsuitable for brain imaging. Herein, we developed a photoacoustic probe that enables real&#8208;time imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the mouse brain. The probe not only responds to oxidative stress in a reversible and ratiometric manner, but it can also cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier of the mouse brain. Notably, the probe displayed excellent photoacoustic imaging of oxidative stress dynamics in the brains of Parkinson's disease mouse models. In addition, we investigated the antioxidant properties of natural polyphenols in the brain of a Parkinson's disease mouse model using the probe as an imaging agent and suggested the potential of the probe for screening anti&#8208;oxidative stress agents.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization: A Convenient Strategy to Realize Efficient BT.2020 Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance emitter using intramolecular cyclization endows BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep blue emission with an ultranarrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16&#8197;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.153, 0.042) in toluene, thus achieving a high external quantum efficiency of 25.6&#8201;% in a hyper&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Rationally tuning the emission position and narrowing the full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of an emitter is of great importance for many applications. By synergistically improving rigidity, strengthening the resonant strength, inhibiting molecular bending and rocking, and destabilizing the HOMO energy level, a deep&#8208;blue emitter (CZ2CO) with a peak wavelength of 440&#8197;nm and an ultranarrow spectral FWHM of 16&#8197;nm (0.10&#8197;eV) was developed via intramolecular cyclization in a carbonyl/N resonant core (QAO). The dominant &#965;0&#8208;0 transition character of CZ2CO gives a Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates (CIE) of (0.144, 0.042), nicely complying with the BT.2020 standard. Moreover, a hyper&#8208;fluorescent device based on CZ2CO shows a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 25.6&#8201;% and maintains an EQE of 22.4&#8201;% at a practical brightness of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Radical (H&#8901;) with GSH for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic photocatalytic hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) generator is activated by glutathione (GSH) for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) against normoxic tumor cells via a hybrid ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis pathway. H&#8901; therapy is also effective in fighting tumors under hypoxic conditions through biological reduction.







Abstract
As a reactive hydrogen species, the hydrogen radical (H&#8901;) scarcely sees applications in tumor biological therapy due to the very limited bio&#8208;friendly sources of H&#8901;. In this work, we report that TAF can act as an organic photosensitizer as well as an efficient photocatalytic H&#8901; generator with reduced glutathione (GSH) as a fuel. The photoactivation of TAF leads to cell death in two ways including triple amplification of oxidative stress via ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis under normoxia and apoptosis through biological reductions under hypoxia. TAF presents excellent biosafety with ultrahigh photocytotoxicity index at an order of magnitude of 102&#8211;103 on both normoxic and hypoxic cells. The in vitro data suggest that H&#8901; therapy is promising to overcome the challenge of tumor hypoxia at low doses of both photocatalyst and light. In addition, the capability of near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon excitation would benefit broad biological applications.

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed Disulfide&#8208;mediated Reversible Polymerization for Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid can catalyze the reversible polymerization of cyclic disulfides, enabling a robust methodology that produces long poly(disulfide)s within a few minutes under open&#8208;air condition. High&#8208;yield chemical recycling from materials to monomers is achieved at gram scale, showing the capability of intrinsic dynamic polymers toward sustainable materials.







Abstract
Poly(1,2&#8208;dithiolane)s are a family of intrinsically recyclable polymers due to their dynamic covalent disulfide linkages. Despite the common use of thiolate&#8208;initiated anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) under basic condition, cationic ROP is still not exploited. Here we report that disulfide bond can act as a proton acceptor, being protonated by acids to form sulfonium cations, which can efficiently initiate the ROP of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes and result in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (over 1000&#8197;kDa) poly(disulfide)s. The reaction can be triggered by adding catalytic amounts of acids and non&#8208;coordinating anion salts, and completed in few minutes at room temperature. The acidic conditions allow the applicability for acidic monomers. Importantly, the reaction condition can be under open air without inert protection, enabling the nearly quantitative chemical recycling from bulk materials to original monomers.

         <title>Electrochemical Single&#8208;Cell Protein Therapeutics Using a Double&#8208;Barrel Nanopipette</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics was devised with an engineered &#952;&#8208;nanopipette and exemplified by protein DJ&#8208;1 enabled neuroprotection. Upon DJ&#8208;1 injection through the delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, as deduced by targeting of the cytosolic H2O2 by the detecting lumen.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics is expected to promote our in&#8208;depth understanding of how a specific protein with a therapeutic dosage treats the cell without population averaging. However, it has not yet been tackled by current single&#8208;cell nanotools. We address this challenge by the use of a double&#8208;barrel nanopipette, in which one lumen was used for electroosmotic cytosolic protein delivery and the other was customized for ionic evaluation of the consequence. Upon injection of protein DJ&#8208;1 through the delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, as deduced by targeting of the cytosolic hydrogen peroxide by the detecting lumen. The nanotool developed in this study for single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics provides a perspective for future single&#8208;cell therapeutics involving different therapeutic modalities, such as peptides, enzymes and nucleic acids.

         <title>Selective Formal Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds of Diboronates by N&#8208;Trisylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with bis(boryl) methane led to the transformation of 1,1&#8208;diboronate into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via 1,2&#8208;borylmethyl migration. With unsymmetric diboronates with two different boryl moieties, the reaction proceeded with excellent regioselectivity. DFT studies reveal an unusual neighbouring boryl group effect that accounts for the observed regioselectivity.







Abstract
Bisborylalkanes play important roles in organic synthesis as versatile bifunctional reagents. The two boron moieties in these compounds can be selectively converted into other functional groups through cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation or radical reactions. Thus, the development of efficient methods for synthesizing bisborylalkanes is highly demanded. Herein we report a new strategy to access bisborylalkanes through the reaction of N&#8208;trisylhydrazones with diboronate, in which the bis(boryl) methane is transformed into 1,2&#8208;bis(boronates) via formal carbene insertion. Since the N&#8208;trisylhydrazones can be readily derived from the corresponding aldehydes, this strategy represents a practical synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diboronates with broad substrate scope.

     alt="Selective Formal Carbene Insertion into Carbon-Boron Bonds of Diboronates by N-Trisylhydrazones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermolecular reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-trisylhydrazones with bis(boryl) methane led to the transformation of 1,1-diboronate into 1,2-bis(boronates) via 1,2-borylmethyl migration. With unsymmetric diboronates with two different boryl moieties, the reaction proceeded with excellent regioselectivity. DFT studies reveal an unusual neighbouring boryl group effect that accounts for the observed regioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bisborylalkanes play important roles in organic synthesis as versatile bifunctional reagents. The two boron moieties in these compounds can be selectively converted into other functional groups through cross-coupling, oxidation or radical reactions. Thus, the development of efficient methods for synthesizing bisborylalkanes is highly demanded. Herein we report a new strategy to access bisborylalkanes through the reaction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-trisylhydrazones with diboronate, in which the bis(boryl) methane is transformed into 1,2-bis(boronates) via formal carbene insertion. Since the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-trisylhydrazones can be readily derived from the corresponding aldehydes, this strategy represents a practical synthesis of 1,2-diboronates with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies reveal an unusual neighboring group effect of 1,1-bis(boronates), which accounts for the observed regioselectivity when unsymmetric 1,1-diboronates are applied.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand Hybridization for Electro&#8208;reforming Waste Glycerol into Isolable Oxalate and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing chelating phenanthrolines with heterogeneous nickel hydroxides can efficiently tune the glycerol electrooxidation selectivities via controlling the catalyst electronic states. The selectivities almost linearly scale with the Hammett parameters of the functional groups on the phenanthrolines, creating new rationales for the design of selective catalysts.







Abstract
The electro&#8208;reforming of glycerol is an emerging technology of simultaneous hydrogen production and biomass valorization. However, its complex reaction network and limited catalyst tunability restrict the precise steering toward high selectivity. Herein, we incorporated the chelating phenanthrolines into the bulk nickel hydroxide and tuned the electronic properties by installing functional groups, yielding tunable selectivity toward formate (max 92.7&#8201;%) and oxalate (max 45.3&#8201;%) with almost linear correlation with the Hammett parameters. Further combinatory study of intermediate analysis and various spectroscopic techniques revealed the electronic effect of tailoring the valence band that balances between C&#8722;C cleavage and oxidation through the key glycolaldehyde intermediate. A two&#8208;electrode electro&#8208;reforming setup using the 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;nickel hydroxide catalyst was further established to convert crude glycerol into pure H2 and isolable sodium oxalate with high efficiency.

         <title>Superconductivity in an Orbital&#8208;Reoriented SnAs Square Lattice: A Case Study of Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of structure unit SnAs4 is realized via a topotactic phase transformation under high pressure, which leads to a record&#8208;high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 7.5&#8197;K among all the synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. It is the synergistic effect of orbital reorientation and charge redistribution from the pz to the px+py orbitals that facilitates the electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosts the superconductivity.







Abstract
Searching for functional square lattices in layered superconductor systems offers an explicit clue to modify the electron behavior and find exotic properties. The trigonal SnAs3 structural units in SnAs&#8208;based systems are relatively conformable to distortion, which provides the possibility to achieve structurally topological transformation and higher superconducting transition temperatures. In the present work, the functional As square lattice was realized and activated in Li0.6Sn2As2 and NaSnAs through a topotactic structural transformation of trigonal SnAs3 to square SnAs4 under pressure, resulting in a record&#8208;high Tc among all synthesized SnAs&#8208;based compounds. Meanwhile, the conductive channel transfers from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane pz orbital to the in&#8208;plane px+py orbitals, facilitating electron hopping within the square 2D lattice and boosting the superconductivity. The reorientation of p&#8208;orbital following a directed local structure transformation provides an effective strategy to modify layered superconducting systems.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Molybdenum Oxide Nanosensitizers for Ultrasound&#8208;Enhanced Cancer Metalloimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoOX nanomaterials were prepared as novel sonosensitizers and TME stimulants for ultrasound&#8208;enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. Under US irradiation, they could generate a massive amount of ROS to induce cell damage and strong ICD. MoOX&#8208;PEG itself could also stimulate the maturation of dendritic cells and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Thus, MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT combined with aCTLA&#8208;4 could elicit robust immune responses for antitumor therapy.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (MoOX) nanomaterials are prepared as novel nanosensitizers and TME&#8208;stimulants for ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced cancer metalloimmunotherapy. After PEGylation, MoOX&#8208;PEG exhibits efficient capability for US&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Under US irradiation, MoOX&#8208;PEG generates a massive amount of ROS to induce cancer cell damage and immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can effectively suppress tumor growth. More importantly, MoOX&#8208;PEG itself further stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and triggeres the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to enhance the immunological effect. Due to the robust ICD induced by SDT and efficient DC maturation stimulated by MoOX&#8208;PEG, the combination treatment of MoOX&#8208;triggered SDT and aCTLA&#8208;4 further amplifies antitumor therapy, inhibits cancer metastases, and elicits robust immune responses to effectively defeat abscopal tumors.

         <title>Ultrathin CuF2&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Induced by Cation&#8208;Tailored Double Electrical Layer toward Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin and CuF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase is formed on CuS anode via Cu cation&#8208;tailored double electrical layer in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures high ion&#8208;conductivity and greatly suppresses the electrolyte continuous decomposition. The modified CuS enables high reversible capacity and ultralong cycling life for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) seriously affects battery's cycling life, especially for high&#8208;capacity anode due to excessive electrolyte decomposition from particle fracture. Herein, we report an ultrathin SEI (3&#8211;4&#8197;nm) induced by Cu+&#8208;tailored double electrical layer (EDL) to suppress electrolyte consumption and enhance cycling stability of CuS anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unique EDL with SO3CF3&#8208;Cu complex absorbing on CuS in NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte is demonstrated by in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman, Cyro&#8208;TEM and theoretical calculation, in which SO3CF3&#8208;Cu could be reduced to CuF2&#8208;rich SEI. Dispersed CuF2 and F&#8208;containing compound can provide good interfacial contact for formation of ultrathin and stable SEI film to minimize electrolyte consumption and reduce activation energy of Na+ transport. As a result, the modified CuS delivers high capacity of 402.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 7000&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. The insights of SEI construction pave a way for high&#8208;stability electrode.

         <title>A Convergent, Modular Approach to Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Bearing 5&#8208;Membered Rings via Catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach to access CF3&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles via catalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion is demonstrated. In the case of carbocycles, an asymmetric benzylic C&#8722;H insertion process allowed to reach high regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. This protocol can be applied to the synthesis of chiral CF3 analogues of medicinal agents and natural products. The origin of selectivity was investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing 5&#8208;membered rings are prevalent in bioactive molecules, but modular approaches to these compounds by functionalization of robust C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in a direct and selective manner are extremely challenging. Herein we report the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene insertion into C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of a broad range of substrates to access 7 types of CF3&#8208;bearing saturated 5&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The reaction is particularly effective for benzylic C&#8722;H insertion exerting good site&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, and applicable to the synthesis of chiral CF3 analogues of bioactive molecules. Ruthenium &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene complexes underwent stoichiometric reactions to give C&#8722;H insertion products, lending evidence for the involvement of metal &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl carbene species in the catalytic cycle. DFT calculations revealed that the &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; attraction and intra&#8208;carbene C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bond elucidate the origin of selectivity of the benzylic C&#8722;H insertion reactions.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ylide functionalized phosphines were tailored supported by computational inverse catalyst design to fit the requirements of mild Hiyama couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silicon enolates with aryl electrophiles are of great synthetic utility, but often limited to expensive bromide substrates. A comparative experimental study confirmed that none of the established ligand systems allows to couple inexpensive aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkylnitriles. In contrast, ylide functionalized phosphines (YPhos) led to encouraging results. A statistical model was developed that correlates the reaction yields with ligand features. It was employed to predict catalyst structures with superior performance. With this cheminformatics approach, YPhos ligands were tailored specifically to the demands of Hiyama couplings. The newly synthesized ligands displayed record&#8208;setting activities, enabling the elusive coupling of aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkyl nitriles. The preparative utility of the catalyst system was demonstrated by the synthesis of pharmaceutically meaningful &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, &#945;&#8208;arylcarbonyls and biaryls.

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Functionalization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides with Thianthrenium Salts: Conjugation and Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts was investigated. The modular nature of this arylating agent allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides bears enormous potential for drug discovery and molecular imaging, among other applications. Herein, we report on a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with readily accessible and modular arylthianthrenium salts. Under exceedingly mild reaction conditions, the late&#8208;stage diversification of structurally complex peptides was accomplished. The tunability and ease of preparation of arylthianthrenium salts allowed the expedient stitching of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with drug, natural product, and peptidic scaffolds by forging sterically congested biaryl linkages. The robustness of the palladium catalysis regime was reflected by the full tolerance of a plethora of sensitive and coordinating functional groups. Hence, our manifold enabled efficient access to highly decorated, labelled, conjugated, and ligated linear and cyclic peptides.

         <title>Light Alters the NH3 vs N2H4 Product Profile in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Nitrogen Reduction via Dual Reactivity from an Iron Hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light irradiation of a tris(phosphine)borane iron (P3BFe) catalyst system during nitrogen reduction (N2R) catalysis alters its product selectivity profile, producing significant N2H4 alongside NH3. Only trace N2H4 is otherwise produced. This study provides insight into the dominant factors determining the selectivity of this catalysis and implicates dual reactivity from a singlet ground versus a triplet excited state hydrazido (Fe=NNH2) intermediate.







Abstract
Whereas synthetically catalyzed nitrogen reduction (N2R) to produce ammonia is widely studied, catalysis to instead produce hydrazine (N2H4) has received less attention despite its considerable mechanistic interest. Herein, we disclose that irradiation of a tris(phosphine)borane (P3B) Fe catalyst, P3BFe+, significantly alters its product profile to increase N2H4 versus NH3; P3BFe+ is otherwise known to be highly selective for NH3. We posit a key terminal hydrazido intermediate, P3BFe=NNH2, as selectivity&#8208;determining. Whereas its singlet ground state undergoes protonation to liberate NH3, a low&#8208;lying triplet excited state leads to reactivity at N&#945; and formation of N2H4. Associated electrochemical and spectroscopic studies establish that N2H4 lies along a unique product pathway; NH3 is not produced from N2H4. Our findings are distinct from the canonical mechanism for hydrazine formation, which proceeds via a diazene (HN=NH) intermediate and showcase light as a tool to tailor selectivity.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,3&#8208;Chiral Centers via Tandem Asymmetric Conjugate Addition and Allylic Substitution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a synthesis of cyclohexanones bearing multi&#8208;continuous stereocenters by combining copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of dialkylzinc reagents to cyclic enones with iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction. Good to excellent yields, diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity can be obtained. The current reaction can achieve the stereodivergent construction of nonadjacent stereocenters.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nickel on Carbon Nitride Photocatalyst Achieves Semihydrogenation of Alkynes with Water Protons via Monovalent Nickel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven semihydrogenation of alkynes with water as the hydrogen source was achieved over single&#8208;atom Ni supported on carbon nitride (CN). The Ni site, paired up with the pyridinic N of the CN scaffold, mediated proton/deuterium transport from water/deuterium oxide (H2O/D2O) to alkynes, producing a diverse range of (deuterated) alkenes with high selectivity.







Abstract
Prospects in light&#8208;driven water activation have prompted rapid progress in hydrogenation reactions. We describe a Ni2+&#8722;N4 site built on carbon nitride for catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes, with water supplying protons, powered by visible&#8208;light irradiation. Importantly, the photocatalytic approach developed here enabled access to diverse deuterated alkenes in D2O with excellent deuterium incorporation. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, evolution of a four&#8208;coordinate Ni2+ species into a three&#8208;coordinate Ni+ species was spectroscopically identified. In combination with theoretical calculations, the photo&#8208;evolved Ni+ is posited as HO&#8722;Ni+&#8722;N2 with an uncoordinated, protonated pyridinic nitrogen, formed by coupled Ni2+ reduction and water dissociation. The paired Ni&#8722;N prompts hydrogen liberation from water, and it renders desorption of alkene preferred over further hydrogenation to alkane, ensuring excellent semihydrogenation selectivity.

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Negative Hydrogen Production Strategy: CO2 Selective Capture with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure is reported. A universal photocatalysis reaction was adopted as driving force and carbonate&#8208;intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with electron storage/release function were employed as adsorption catalysts.







Abstract
We reported a strategy of carbon&#8208;negative H2 production in which CO2 capture was coupled with H2 evolution at ambient temperature and pressure. For this purpose, carbonate&#8208;type CuxMgyFez layered double hydroxide (LDH) was preciously constructed, and then a photocatalysis reaction of interlayer CO32&#8722; reduction with glycerol oxidation was performed as driving force to induce the electron storage on LDH layers. With the participation of pre&#8208;stored electrons, CO2 was captured to recover interlayer CO32&#8722; in presence of H2O, accompanied with equivalent H2 production. During photocatalysis reaction, Cu0.6Mg1.4Fe1 exhibited a decent CO evolution amount of 1.63&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and dihydroxyacetone yield of 3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In carbon&#8208;negative H2 production process, it showed an exciting CO2 capture quantity of 1.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and H2 yield of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. Besides, this system possessed stable operation capability under simulated flu gas condition with negligible performance loss, exhibiting application prospect.

         <title>Optimized Sieving Effect for Ethanol/Water Separation by Ultramicroporous MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent ethanol/water separation has been achieved using two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) owing to molecular sieving effect. The slightly larger rhombohedral channels in Co&#8208;squarate provide a further optimization of sieving effect by enhancing the guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. A benchmarking water adsorption capacity at ultralow pressure is obtained in Co&#8208;squarate.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity ethanol is a promising renewable energy resource, however separating ethanol from trace amount of water is extremely challenging. Herein, two ultramicroporous MOFs (UTSA&#8208;280 and Co&#8208;squarate) were used as adsorbents. A prominent water adsorption and a negligible ethanol adsorption identify perfect sieving effect on both MOFs. Co&#8208;squarate exhibits a surprising water adsorption capacity at low pressure that surpassing the reported MOFs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations reveal that such prominent performance of Co&#8208;squarate derives from the optimized sieving effect through pore structure adjustment. Co&#8208;squarate with larger rhombohedral channel is suitable for zigzag water location, resulting in reinforced guest&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;framework interactions. Ultrapure ethanol (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained directly by ethanol/water mixed vapor breaking through the columns packed with Co&#8208;squarate, contributing to a potential for fuel&#8208;grade ethanol purification.

         <title>Transient and Dissipative Host&#8211;Guest Hydrogels Regulated by Consumption of a Reactive Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route to prepare dynamic hydrogel materials has been developed that uses a reactive and consumable chemical stimulus to temporarily upgrade host&#8211;guest affinity and drive hydrogelation. These hydrogels exist only transiently, autonomously transitioning back to a flowing suspension over time.







Abstract
The transient self&#8208;assembly of molecules under the direction of a consumable fuel source is fundamental to biological processes such as cellular organization and motility. Such biomolecular assemblies exist in an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium state, requiring continuous consumption of high energy molecules. At the same time, the creation of bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels has traditionally focused on associations occurring at the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here, hydrogels are prepared from cucurbit[7]uril host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions through transient physical crosslinking driven by the consumption of a reactive chemical fuel. Upon action from this fuel, the affinity and dynamics of CB[7]&#8211;guest recognition are altered. In this way, the lifetime of transient hydrogel formation and the dynamic modulus obtained are governed by fuel consumption, rather than being directed by equilibrium complex formation.

         <title>Urethanases for the Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Low Molecular Weight Carbamates and the Recycling of Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We made a metagenome library and discovered urethanases that can hydrolyse a broad range of industrially relevant dicarbamates resulting from glycolysis of polyether&#8208;polyurethanes. This enables a two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic recycling procedure consisting of glycolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, allowing both the polyether polyols and the aromatic diamines to be recovered from polyether&#8208;polyurethane foams.







Abstract
Enzymatic degradation and recycling can reduce the environmental impact of plastics. Despite decades of research, no enzymes for the efficient hydrolysis of polyurethanes have been reported. Whereas the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in polyester&#8208;polyurethanes by cutinases is known, the urethane bonds in polyether&#8208;polyurethanes have remained inaccessible to biocatalytic hydrolysis. Here we report the discovery of urethanases from a metagenome library constructed from soil that had been exposed to polyurethane waste for many years. We then demonstrate the use of a urethanase in a chemoenzymatic process for polyurethane foam recycling. The urethanase hydrolyses low molecular weight dicarbamates resulting from chemical glycolysis of polyether&#8208;polyurethane foam, making this strategy broadly applicable to diverse polyether&#8208;polyurethane wastes.

         <title>Intense d&#8208;p Hybridization in Nb3O15 Tripolymer Induced the Largest Second Harmonic Generation Response and Birefringence in Germanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K3Nb3Ge2O13 is shown to be an excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal with the largest second harmonic generation (SHG) response and birefringence found in germinates, as well as a large band gap and low phonon energy.







Abstract
We herein report two asymmetric germanate crystals, KNbGe3O9 and K3Nb3Ge2O13, with different structures and optical properties derived from divergent polymerized forms of GeO4 and NbO6 groups. Remarkably, K3Nb3Ge2O13 achieved a rare combination of the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 17.5&#215;KDP&#8201;@&#8201;1064&#8197;nm and the largest birefringence of 0.196&#8201;@&#8201;546&#8197;nm in germanates. It features unique [Nb3O12]&#8734; tubular chains constructed by circular Nb3O15 tripolymers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the d&#8208;p interactions in the Nb3O15 group are responsible for outstanding optical properties. This work emphasizes the significance of the polymerizable functional units in obtaining high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals.

         <title>Low Coordination State RhI&#8208;Complex as High Performance Catalyst for Asymmetric Intramolecular Cyclopropanation: Construction of penta&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed that allows otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access penta&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes to be prepared in a highly enantioselective manner through asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of rather challenging tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates. Extraordinary high performance of RhI/diene complex is showcased with low catalyst loading as little as 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%.







Abstract
A simple, broad&#8208;scope rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system for challenging asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation of various tri&#8208;substituted allylic diazoacetates was successfully developed. The low coordination state RhI&#8208;complex exhibits an extraordinarily high degree of tolerance to the variation in the extent of substitution of the allyl double bond, thus allowing the efficient construction of a wide range of penta&#8208;substituted, fused&#8208;ring cyclopropanes bearing three contiguous stereogenic centers, including two quaternary carbon stereocenters, in a highly enantioselective manner with ease at catalyst loading as low as 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. The stereoinduction mode of this RhI&#8208;carbene&#8208;directed asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation was investigated by DFT calculations, indicating that &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of chiral diene ligand and diazo substrate play a key role in the control of the reaction enantioselectivity.

         <title>Subsurface Engineering Induced Fermi Level De&#8208;pinning in Metal Oxide Semiconductors for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of universal subsurface oxygen vacancy strategy, the surface Fermi level de&#8208;pinning in a series of metal oxide semiconductor are achieved while retaining the active defective structure. The completely splitted quasi Fermi level of holes and electrons induces enhanced open&#8208;circuit photovoltage, providing sufficient driving force for charge transfer, to achieve robust photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for renewable solar light conversion. However, surface Fermi level pinning (FLP), caused by surface trap states, severely restricts the PEC activities. Theoretical calculations indicate subsurface oxygen vacancy (sub&#8208;Ov) could release the FLP and retain the active structure. A series of metal oxide semiconductors with sub&#8208;Ov were prepared through precisely regulated spin&#8208;coating and calcination. Etching X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron energy loss spectra (EELS) demonstrated Ov located at sub &#8764;2&#8211;5&#8197;nm region. Mott&#8211;Schottky and open circuit photovoltage results confirmed the surface trap states elimination and Fermi level de&#8208;pinning. Thus, superior PEC performances of 5.1, 3.4, and 2.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE were achieved on BiVO4, Bi2O3, TiO2 with outstanding stability for 72&#8197;h, outperforming most reported works under the identical conditions.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymerization of Polymeric Nanorods Mediated by Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular polymerization of polymeric nanorods mediated by block copolymers has been demonstrated. The block copolymers concentrate around the nanorod ends and leave hydrophobic sides exposed. Driven by hydrophobic interactions, the nanorods connect to form bundles. As polymerization progresses, the copolymers gradually deposit and assemble into helical nanopatterns on the bundle surface, which terminates supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Introducing a second component is an effective way to manipulate polymerization behavior. However, this phenomenon has rarely been observed in colloidal systems, such as polymeric nanoparticles. Here, we report the supramolecular polymerization of polymeric nanorods mediated by block copolymers. Experimental observations and simulation results illustrate that block copolymers surround the polymeric nanorods and mainly concentrate around the two ends, leaving the hydrophobic side regions exposed. These polymeric nanorods connect in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side manner through hydrophobic interactions to form bundles. As polymerization progresses, the block copolymers gradually deposit onto the bundles and finally assemble into helical nanopatterns on the outermost surface, which terminates the polymerization. It is anticipated that this work could offer inspiration for a general strategy of controllable supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastic degrading enzymes, highlight of Uttamapinant et&#8197;al.&#8217;s work. They report the discovery of new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzymes from aquatic and human saliva metagenomes. Their catalytic performance is up to 83 times higher than known PETases. Site&#8208;specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid results in a stable acyl&#8208;enzyme intermediate and a PET&#8208;enzyme conjugate which can be imaged via confocal microscopy.







Abstract
The discovery and engineering of new plastic degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable and circular plastics economy. This field has so far yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New research from Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. reports the discovery of a novel polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome that displays improved properties and catalytic performance over previously characterized PET hydrolases (PETases). The authors also demonstrate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP), which upon photodecaging enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface. Thus, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion, enabling new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.

Thus, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code expansion, enabling new biotechnologies for the circular plastics economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complementary Design in Multicomponent Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction: Beyond the Leverage in Activity and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is promising in place of the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for artificial N2 fixation. However, the high activity and selectivity of eNRR are challenging to achieve simultaneously due to the scaling relations. Such &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity has severely restricted eNRR. To overcome this bottleneck, the complementary design of electronic structures in multicomponent electrocatalysts has been recently pursued, aiming to maximize the advantages of each component and optimize the multistep reactions, which has stood at the cutting edge in this aspect. Here, we present a minireview of the design, performance, and mechanism of multicomponent electrocatalysts with complementary electronic structures. We particularly emphasize the interactions between N2 and elements from d&#8208;, p&#8208;, and s&#8208;blocks, which are essential for understanding how these electrocatalysts are beyond the &#8220;leverage&#8221; between activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Synergistic Catalysis on Cu&#8208;Se Dual Atom Sites via Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction and understanding of synergy in well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom active sites is an available avenue to promote multistep tandem catalytic reactions. Herein, we construct a dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom catalyst that comprises adjacent Cu&#8208;N4 and Se&#8208;C3 active sites for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations provide in&#8208;depth insights into this dual&#8208;atom synergy mechanism for ORR under realistic device operation conditions. The heteroatom Se modulator can efficiently polarize the charge distribution around symmetrical Cu&#8208;N4 moieties, and serve as synergistic site to facilitate the second oxygen reduction step simultaneously, in which the key OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) transforms to O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate on the dual&#8208;atom sites. Therefore, this designed catalyst achieves satisfied alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.905 V vs. RHE and a maximum power density of 206.5 mW cm&#8208;2 in Zn&#8208;air battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Fusion Yields Guest Acceptors that Enable Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 18.77% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and selection of a suitable guest acceptor are particularly important for improving the photovoltaic performance of ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we designed and successfully synthesized two asymmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen bridged guest acceptors, which featured distinct blue&#8208;shifted absorption, upshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, and larger dipole moments than symmetric silicon&#8211;oxygen&#8208;bridged acceptor. Ternary devices with the incorporation of 14.2wt% these two asymmetric guest acceptors exhibited excellent performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.22% and 18.77%, respectively. Our success in precise control of material properties via structural fusion of five&#8208;membered carbon linkages and six&#8208;membered silicon&#8211;oxygen connection at the central electron&#8208;donating core unit of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors can attract considerable attention and bring new vigor and vitality for developing new materials toward more efficient OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triptycene&#8208;Based 2D MOF with Vertically Extended Structure for Improving the Electrocatalytic Performance of CO2 to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their unique structures and physical&#8208;chemical properties. However, the planarly extended structure of 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs usually limited the accessibility of the active sites. Herein, we designed a triptycene&#8208;based 2D vertically conductive MOF (2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF) by coordinating 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexahydroxyltriptycene (HHTC) with Cu2+. The vertically extended 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) possesses a weak interlayer interaction, which leads to a facile exfoliation to the nanosheet. Compared with the classical 2D&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs with planarly extended 2D structures, 2D&#8208;vc&#8208;MOF(Cu) exhibits a 100% increased catalytic activity in terms of turnover number and a two&#8208;fold increased selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that higher activity originated from the lower energy barriers of the vertically extended 2D structures during the CO2 reduction reaction process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphdiynes (GDYs), two&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;like carbon systems, are considered as potential advanced membrane material due to their unique physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the scale&#8208;up of integrated GDY membranes&#160;is technologically challenging, and most studies remain at the theoretical stage. Herein, we report a simple and efficient alkynylated &#160;surface&#8208;mediated strategy to prepare hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) membranes on commercial alumina tubes. Surface alkynylation&#160;initiates an accelerated surface&#8208;confined coupling reaction&#160;in the presence of a copper catalyst and facilitates the nanoscale epitaxial&#160;lateral growth of HsGDY. A continuous and ultra&#8208;thin HsGDY membrane (~ 100 nm) can be produced within 15 min. The resulting membranes exhibit outstanding molecular sieving together with excellent water permeances (ca. 1100 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 MPa&#8208;1), and show a long&#8208;term durability in cross&#8208;flow nanofiltration, owing to the superhydrophilic surface and hydrophobic pore walls.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Colloidal Quantum Wells for Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite colloidal quantum wells (QWs) are promising to realize narrow deep&#8208;blue emission, but the poor optical performance and stability suppress their practical application. Here, we creatively propose a water&#8208;driven synthesis strategy to obtain size&#8208;homogenized and strongly confined deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 QWs, corresponding to three monolayers, which emit at the deep&#8208;blue wavelength of 456 nm. The water controls the orientation and distribution of the ligands on the surface of the nanocrystals, thus inducing orientated growth through the Ostwald ripening process by phagocytizing unstable nanocrystals to form well&#8208;crystallized QWs. These QWs present remarkable stability and high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94%. Furthermore, we have prepared light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the QWs via the all&#8208;solution fabrication strategy, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1% and luminance of 2946 cd m&#8208;2, demonstrating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art brightness for perovskite QW&#8208;based LEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple process for the oxy&#8208;monofluoromethylation of alkenes is described. In combination with visible&#8208;light copper(I)&#8208;photoredox catalysis, an easily accessible iodine(III) reagent containing monofluoroacetoxy ligands serves as a powerful source of monofluoromethyl (CH2F) radical, enabling the step economical synthesis of &#947;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;acetates from a broad range of olefinic substrates under mild conditions. Applications to late&#8208;stage diversification of alkenes derived from complex molecules, amino acids and synthesis of fluoromethylated heterocycles are also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized via a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor via thermal&#8208;induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color evolvements to blue or green are observed in these charge separation states. It is of interest to note that such charge separation states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month due to the excellent coplanarity and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge separation state with near&#8208;infrared (808 nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, of which the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Green Synthesis of Robust Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hofmann Clathrate Material with Record C3H6&#160;Storage Density for Efficient C3H6/C3H8&#160;Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing&#160;porous materials for C3H6/C3H8&#160;separation faces the challenge of merging excellent separation performance with high stability and easy scalability of synthesis. Herein, we report a robust Hofmann clathrate material (ZJU&#8208;75a), featuring high&#8208;density strong binding sites to achieve all the above requirements. ZJU&#8208;75a adsorbs large amount of C3H6with a record high storage density of 0.818 g mL&#8722;1, and concurrently shows high C3H6/C3H8&#160;selectivity (54.2)&#160;at&#160;296 K and 1 bar. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis unveil that the high&#8208;density binding sites in ZJU&#8208;75a not only provide much stronger interactions with C3H6&#160;but also enable the dense packing of C3H6. Breakthrough experiments on gas mixtures afford both high separation factor of 14.7 and large C3H6&#160;uptake (2.79 mmol g&#8208;1). This material is highly stable and can be easily produced at kilogram&#8208;scale using a green synthesis method, making it as a benchmark material to address major challenges for industrial C3H6/C3H8&#160;separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of L&#8208;Lactate and D&#8208;Glucose Using DNA Aptamers in Human Blood Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;lactate is a key metabolite indicative of physiological states, glycolysis pathways, and various diseases such as sepsis, heart attack, lactate acidosis, and cancer. Detection of lactate has been relying on a few enzymes that need other substrates. In this work, DNA aptamers for L&#8208;lactate were obtained using a library&#8208;immobilization selection method and the highest affinity aptamer reached a Kd of 0.43 mM as determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The aptamers showed up to 50&#8208;fold selectivity for L&#8208;lactate over D&#8208;lactate and had little responses to other closely related analogs such as pyruvate and 3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. A fluorescent biosensor based on the strand displacement method showed a limit of detection of 0.55 mM L&#8208;lactate, and the sensor worked in 90% serum. Simultaneous detection of L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose in the same solution was achieved. This work has broadened the scope of aptamers to simple metabolites and provided a useful probe for continuous and multiplexed monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited State Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: From the Special Pair to the Creutz&#8208;Taube Ion and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds and complexes with mixed&#8208;valence ground electronic states such as the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion have proven to be excellent vehicles through which to study intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer processes. In a recent contribution by Cadranel and co&#8208;workers, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals photo&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;bridge charge transfer within the homovalent analogue of the Creutz&#8208;Taube ion, [{(NH3)5Ru}(m&#8208;pz){Ru(NH3)5}]4+, giving rise to two closely lying excited states with mixed&#8208;valence character, one with a shorter lifetime (&#964; = 136 ps) and weakly&#8208;coupled (Robin&#8208;Day Class II) character, the other a longer&#8208;lived (&#964; = 2.8 ns) configurational isomer with more delocalized electronic structure. Electron transfer reactions from the longer&#8208;lived species demonstrate analogies with the photo&#8208;induced reactions of the photosynthetic special pair, suggesting this state as a reference system for excited&#8208;state mixed&#8208;valency, and a framework from which to explore photocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Galvanic Redox Potentiometry for Fouling&#8208;Free and Stable Serotonin Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a major neurotransmitter broadly involved in many aspects of feeling and behavior. Although its electro&#8208;active feature renders the electrochemical sensor promising, the persistent generation of fouling layers on electrode by its oxidation products presents a hurdle for reliable sensing. Here, we present a fouling&#8208;free 5&#8208;HT sensor based on galvanic redox potentiometry. The sensor efficiently minimizes electrode fouling as revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, ensuring a less than 3% signal change in a 2&#8208;hour continuous experiment, whereas amperometric sensors losing 90% within 30 min. Most importantly, the sensor is highly amenable for in vivo studies, permitting real&#8208;time 5&#8208;HT monitoring, and supporting the mechanism associated with serotonin release in brain. Our system offers an effective way to sensing different neurochemicals having significant fouling issues, thus facilitating the molecular&#8208;level understanding of brain function.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although great progress has been made in new electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), the intrinsic relationship between electrolyte composition and cell performance remains unclear due to the lack of valid quantization method. Here, we proposed the concept of negative center of electrostatic potential (NCESP) and Mayer bond order (MBO) to describe solvent capability, which highly relate to solvation structure and oxidation potential, respectively. Based on established principles, the selected electrolyte with 1.7 M LiFSI in methoxytrimethylsilane (MOTMS)/ (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFMTMS) shows unique hyperconjugation nature to stabilize both Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathode. The 4.6 V 30 &#956;m Li||4.5 mAh cm&#8208;2 lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) (low N/P ratio of 1.3) cell with our electrolyte shows stable cycling with 91% capacity retention over 200 cycles. The bottom&#8208;up design concept of electrolyte opens up a general strategy for advancing high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Splitting and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provide promising solutions to global energy and environmental issues. In recent years, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of crystalline porous solids featuring well&#8208;defined and tailorable structures as well as high surface areas, have captured great interest toward photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction. In this review, the semiconductor&#8208;like behavior of MOFs is first discussed. We then summarize the recent advances in photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction over MOF&#8208;based materials and focus on the unique advantage of MOFs for clarifying the structure&#8208;property relationship in photocatalysis. In addition, some representative characterization techniques have been presented to unveil the photocatalytic kinetics and reaction intermediates in MOF&#8208;based systems. Finally, the challenges, and perspectives for future directions are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Recovery and Recycling of Homogeneous Organocatalysts Enabled by Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We address a critical challenge of recovering and recycling homogeneous organocatalysts by designing photoswitchable catalyst structures that display a reversible solubility change in response to light. Initially&#8208;insoluble catalysts are UV&#8208;switched to a soluble isomeric state, which catalyzes the reaction, then back&#8208;isomerizes to the insoluble state upon completion of the reaction to be filtered and recycled. The molecular design principles that allow for the drastic solubility change over 10 times between the isomeric states, 87% recovery by the light&#8208;induced precipitation, and multiple rounds of catalyst recycling are revealed. This proof of concept will open up opportunities to develop highly&#8208;recyclable homogeneous catalysts that are important for the synthesis of critical compounds in various industries, which is anticipated to significantly reduce environmental impact and costs.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Single Electron Redox Steps Convert Polycycles with a C3P3 core to a Planar Triphosphinine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;stabilized diphosphete&#8208;diide IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords a mixture which contains the molecules 1a and 1b with a central C3P3 core, which formally carries a two&#8208;fold negative charge. In order to avoid the formation of an antiaromatic 8&#960; electron system within a conjugated dianionic six&#8208;membered [C3P3]2&#8208; ring, 1a adopts a bicyclic [3.1.0] and 1b a tricyclic [2.2.0.0] structure which are in a dynamic equilibrium. 1a,b can be reversibly oxidized to a triphosphinine dication [5]2+ with a central flat aromatic six&#8208;membered C3P3 ring. This two&#8208;electron redox reaction occurs in two single&#8208;electron transfer steps via the 7&#960;&#8208;radical cation [4]&#8729;+, which could also be isolated and fully characterized. The profound reversible structural change observed for the two&#8208;electron redox couple [5]2+/1a,b is in sharp contrast to the C6H6/ [C6H6]2&#8208; couple, which undergoes only a modest structural deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments on Understanding Charge Transfer in Molecular Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge transfer (CT) in molecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems is pivotal for artificial photosynthesis, photocatalysis, photovoltaics and fundamental photochemistry. We summarized the recent development in study of CT and discussed its application in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. The direct experimental proof of the spin multiplicity of the charge separated (CS) state with pulsed laser excited time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy was discussed. Experimental determination of the electron exchange energy (J) of the CS state, with magnetic field effect on its yield or lifetime was introduced. The electron spin transfer accompanying the CT, studied with pulsed EPR spectra was briefly discussed. Tuning of the CT yield and kinetics with selective vibration excitation of the linker (the bridge) with IR pulse was presented. Above all, these studies show that there are more fun than simply monitoring the formation of the cation and anions and the kinetics or CS yields in this area.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique structural characteristics of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) like high surface areas, interconnected pore system and readily accessible active sites render them promising platforms for a wide set of functional applications. Albeit promising, the reticular construction of 3D COFs with large pores is a very demanding task owing to the formation of interpenetrated frameworks. Herein we report the designed synthesis of a 3D non&#8208;interpenetrated stp net COF, namely TUS&#8208;64, with the largest pore size of all 3D COFs (47 &#197;) and record&#8208;low density (0.106 g cm&#8208;3) by reticulating a 6&#8208;connected triptycene&#8208;based linker with a 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based linker. Characterized with a highly interconnected mesoporous scaffold and good stability, TUS&#8208;64 shows efficient drug loading and controlled release for five different drugs in simulated body fluid environment, demonstrating the competency of TUS&#8208;64 as drug nanocarriers.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting Highly Enantioselective Catalysts Using Tunable Fragment Descriptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst optimization processes typically rely on inductive and qualitative assumptions of chemists based on screening data. While machine learning models using molecular properties or calculated 3D structures enable quantitative data evaluation, costly quantum chemical calculations are often required. In contrast, readily available binary fingerprint descriptors are time&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient, but their predictive performance remains insufficient. Here, we describe a machine learning model based on fragment descriptors, which are fine&#8208;tuned for asymmetric catalysis and represent cyclic or polyaromatic hydrocarbons, enabling robust and efficient virtual screening. Using training data with only moderate selectivities, we designed theoretically and validated experimentally new catalysts showing higher selectivities in a challenging asymmetric tetrahydropyran synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Carboxylation of C&#8722;N Bonds in Cyclic Amines with CO2 by Consecutive Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light photocatalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly important. However, it still remains challenging for reluctant substrates with low reduction potentials. Herein, we report a novel photocatalytic carboxylation of C&#8722;N bonds in cyclic amines with CO2 via consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (ConPET). It is also the first photocatalytic reductive ring&#8208;opening reactionof azetidines, pyrrolidines and piperidines.This strategyis practical to transform a variety of easily available cyclic amines to valuable &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208;, &#948;&#8208; and &#949;&#8208;amino acids in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Moreover, themethodalso features mild and transition metal&#8208;free conditions, high selectivity, good functional group tolerance, facile scalability and productderivations. Mechanistic studies indicate that the ConPET might be the key to generating highly reactive photocatalysts, which enable the reductiveactivation of cyclic aminesto generatecarbon radicals and carbanions as the key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Somalactams A&#8211;D: Anti&#8208;inflammatory Macrolide Lactams with Unique Ring Systems from an Arctic Actinomycete Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new PKS&#8208;NRPS&#8208;derived macrolide lactams (1&#8211;4) with three unique ring fusion types were discovered from the Arctic sponge&#8208;associated actinomycete Streptomyces somaliensis 1107 using a genome mining strategy. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopic analyses, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. Biosynthetically, a novel gene cluster sml consisting of three polyketide synthases and one hybrid polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase together with cytochrome P450s and flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenases and oxidoreductases was demonstrated to assemble the unique skeleton. Pharmacological studies revealed that compound 1 displayed a potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity. It inhibited IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 0.18 &#181;M, respectively, and modulated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, compound 1 alleviated LPS&#8208;induced systemic inflammation in our transgenic fluorescent zebrafish model.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Handed Helical Tubular Ladder Polymers for Chromatographic Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defect&#8208;free one&#8208;handed contracted helical tubular ladder polymers with a &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity were synthesized by alkyne benzannulations of the random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing 6,6&#180;&#8208;linked&#8208;1,1&#180;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#180;&#8208;diol&#8208;based chiral monomer units. The resulting tightly&#8208;twisted helical tubular ladder polymers showed remarkably high enantioseparation abilities toward a variety of chiral hydrophobic aromatics with point, axial, and planar chiralities. The random&#8208;coil precursor polymer and analogous rigid&#8208;rod extended helical ribbon&#8208;like ladder polymer with no internal helical cavity exhibited no resolution abilities. The molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich cylindrical helical cavity formed in the tightly&#8208;twisted tubular helical ladder structures is of key importance for producing the highly&#8208;enantioseparation ability, by which chiral aromatics can be enantioselectively encapsulated by specific &#960;&#8208;&#960; and/or hydrophobic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Norbornene as a Novel Hydrophobic Tag Applied in Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic tagging (HyT) is a potential therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). Norbornene was discovered as an unprecedented hydrophobic tag in this study and was used to degrade the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein by linking it to ALK inhibitors. The most promising degrader, Hyt&#8208;9, potently reduced ALK levels through Hsp70 and the ubiquitin&#8210;proteasome system (UPS) in vitro without compensatory upregulation of ALK. Furthermore, Hyt&#8208;9 exhibited a significant tumor&#8208;inhibiting effect in vivo with moderate oral bioavailability. More importantly, norbornene can also be used to degrade the intractable enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) when tagged with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. Thus, the discovery of novel hydrophobic norbornene tags shows promise for the future development of TPD technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoindolium&#8208;Based Allenes: Reactivity Studies and Applications in Fluorescence Temperature Sensing and Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a series of&#160;electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied, leading to the formation of isoindolium&#8208;based vinyl sulfides. The vinyl sulfides generated&#160;could be readily converted into the corresponding indanones and amines upon heating at 30 &#8208; 70 &#176;C with good yields up to 61%. The thermal cleavage reaction of vinyl sulfides was further studied for developing temperature&#8208;sensitive systems. Notably, a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor was designed and synthesized for temperature sensing at 50 &#176;C, giving a 6.5&#8208;fold blue fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, chemoselective bioconjugation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides with the isoindolium&#8208;based allenes for the construction of multifunctional peptide bioconjugates was investigated. Thermal cleavage of isoindoliums on the modified peptides at 35 &#8208; 70 &#176;C gave indanone bioconjugates with up to &gt;99% conversion. These results indicated the biocompatibility of this novel temperature&#8208;sensitive reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Switchable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Dye Based on Redox&#8208;Bistable Benzitetraazaporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes responsive to external stimuli are used in medical and other applications. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of bench&#8208;stable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins (BzTAPs) possessing redox&#8208;switchable NIR properties. X&#8208;Ray, NMR, and UV&#8208;visible&#8208;NIR analyses revealed that 20&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 1 exhibits NIR absorption and antiaromaticity with a paratropic ring&#8208;current, while 18&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 2 shows weakly aromatic character with NIR inertness. Notably, the NIR&#8208;silent BzTAP 2 was readily converted to the NIR&#8208;active BzTAP 1 in the presence of mild reducing agents such as amine. The intense NIR absorption band of BzTAP 1 is in sharp contrast to the very weak absorption bands of previously reported antiaromatic porphyrinoids. Molecular orbital analysis revealed that symmetry&#8208;lowering perturbation of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron porphyrinoid skeleton enables the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition of 1 to be electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed. BzTAPs are expected to be useful for constructing activatable NIR probes working in reductive environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Micro Space Electrostatic Field in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery: Scalable Electrospray Fabrication of Porous Crystalline Anode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhomogeneous consumption of anions and direct contact between electrolyte and anode during the Zn&#8208;deposition process generate Zn&#8208;dendrites and side reactions that can aggravate the space&#8208;charge effect to hinder the practical implementation of zinc&#8208;metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, electrospray has been applied for the scalable fabrication (&gt;10000 cm2 in a batch&#8208;experiment) of hetero&#8208;metallic cluster covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (MCOF&#8208;Ti6Cu3) nanosheet&#8208;coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection. The MNC@Zn symmetric cell presents ultralow overpotential (~72.8 mV) over 10000 cycles at 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 with 20 mA cm&#8208;2, which is superior to bare Zn and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous crystalline materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that MNC with integrated micro space electrostatic field can facilitate the deposition&#8208;kinetic and homogenize the electric field of anode to significantly promote the lifespan of ZMBs.</dc:description>

The MNC@Zn symmetric cell presents ultralow overpotential (~72.8 mV) over 10000 cycles at 1 mAh cm-2 with 20 mA cm-2, which is superior to bare Zn and state-of-the-art porous crystalline materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that MNC with integrated micro space electrostatic field can facilitate the deposition-kinetic and homogenize the electric field of anode to significantly promote the lifespan of ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Cytochrome P450BM3 Enzymes for Direct Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applications of peroxidase activities of cytochrome P450 enzymes in synthetic chemistry remain largely unexplored. We present here a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for direct nitration of unsaturated aromatic and terminal aryl olefin compounds in the presence of a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Site&#8208;directed mutations of key active site residues allowed an efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease and increase in the monooxygenation and peroxidase activities, respectively. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;nitration products with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high total turnover numbers. This is the first report of direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent. We also demonstrated the use of the DFSM&#8208;facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nature has developed a plethora of protein machinery to operate and maintain nearly every task of cellular life. These processes are tightly regulated via post&#8208;expression modifications &#8211; transformations that modulate intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and activation. Methods to prepare homogeneously and precisely modified proteins are essential to probe their function and design new bioactive modalities. Synthetic chemistry has contributed remarkably to protein science by allowing the preparation of novel biomacromolecules that are often challenging or impractical to prepare via common biological means. The ability to chemically build and precisely modify proteins has enabled the production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties and programmed activity for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications.

         <title>The Effect of Molecular Conformations and Simulated &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; in Phenothiazine Derivatives on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied. A stimulated self&#8208;doping system was constructed with the ax&#8208;conformer as host and the eq&#8208;conformer as guest, thus achieving highly promoted RTP performance.







Abstract
The research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has drawn great attention for their wide potential applications. Besides single&#8208;component and host&#8211;guest doping systems, the self&#8208;doping with same molecule but different conformations in one state is also a possible way to construct RTP materials, regardless of its rare investigation. In this work, twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied, with the aim to deeply understand the self&#8208;doping effect on the corresponding RTP property. While the phenothiazine derivatives with quasi&#8208;axial (ax) conformation presented better RTP performance in aggregated state, the quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) ones were better in isolated state. Accordingly, the much promoted RTP performance was achieved in the stimulated self&#8208;doping state with ax&#8208;conformer as host and eq&#8208;one as guest, demonstrating the significant influence of self&#8208;doping on RTP effect.

         <title>NMR and DFT Studies with a Doubly Labelled 15N/6Li S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Reveal Why a Directed ortho&#8208;Lithiation Requires an Excess of n&#8208;BuLi</title>

An NMR study was able to clearly explain why an excess of base is needed to deprotonate the aromatic ring of a S&#8208;trifluoromethylsulfoximine, thanks in particular to the identification and characterization of all the aggregates present in the medium.







Abstract
This work shows why it is imperious to use an excess of butyllithium for a directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of a trifluoromethyl sulfoximine. The analysis of mixtures of n&#8208;BuLi and sulfoximine 1 in THF&#8208;d8 using {1H, 6Li, 13C, 15N, 19F} NMR experiments at low temperatures reveal that a first deprotonation occurs that leads to dimeric and tetrameric N&#8208;lithiated sulfoximine (93&#8201;:&#8201;7). Using an excess n&#8208;BuLi (5&#8197;equivalents), the second deprotonation on the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic occurs. Six species were observed and characterized on the way. It includes three aggregates involving a sulfoximine: i)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)] dimer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg2, 39&#8201;%); ii)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)3] tetramer solvated by six molecules of THF (Agg3, 39&#8201;%); iii)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuOLi)3] tetramer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg1, 22&#8201;%). A DFT study afforded optimized solvated structures for all these aggregates, fully consistent with the NMR data.

         <title>Mapping the Complete Photocycle that Powers a Large Stokes Shift Red Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the working mechanisms of red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) in aqueous solution is essential for bioimaging. We implemented a synergistic toolset (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies) and elucidated the complete photocycle that powers a large&#8208;Stokes&#8208;shift RFP, tracking the ultrafast excited&#8208;state proton transfer and chromophore twists in action and also providing protein rational design principles.







Abstract
Large Stokes shift (LSS) red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are highly desirable for bioimaging advances. The RFP mKeima, with coexisting cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, holds significance as an archetypal system for LSS emission due to excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT), yet the mechanisms remain elusive. We implemented femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and various time&#8208;resolved electronic spectroscopies, aided by quantum calculations, to dissect the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;mKeima photocycle from ESPT, isomerization, to ground&#8208;state proton transfer in solution. This work manifests the power of FSRS with global analysis to resolve Raman fingerprints of intermediate states. Importantly, the deprotonated trans&#8208;isomer governs LSS emission at 620&#8197;nm, while the deprotonated cis&#8208;isomer's 520&#8197;nm emission is weak due to an ultrafast cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization. Complementary spectroscopic techniques as a table&#8208;top toolset are thus essential to study photochemistry in physiological environments.

         <title>Multifunctional Helicene&#8208;Based Ytterbium Coordination Polymer Displaying Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Room Temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism

Enantiopure 1D YbIII coordination polymers involving helicene&#8208;based ligands were designed. Their physical investigations revealed an unprecedented combination of field&#8208;induced Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior, Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence and room temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD). The magnetic anisotropy was determined as the preponderant criterion for the observation of a strong MChD.







Abstract
The combination of physical properties sensitive to molecular chirality in a single system allows the observation of fascinating phenomena such as magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism (MChD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) having potential applications for optical data readout and display technology. Homochiral monodimensional coordination polymers of YbIII were designed from a 2,15&#8208;bis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;hexahelicenic scaffold decorated with two terminal 4&#8208;pyridyl units. Thanks to the coordination of the chiral organic chromophore to Yb(hfac)3 units (hfac&#8722;=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylaconate), efficient NIR&#8208;CPL activity is observed. Moreover, the specific crystal field around the YbIII induces a strong magnetic anisotropy which leads to a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour and a remarkable room temperature MChD. The MChD&#8208;structural correlation is supported by computational investigations.

         <title>Negligible Ion Migration in Tin&#8208;Based and Tin&#8208;Doped Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration in tin&#8208;halide perovskites is investigated with a full range of bromide ratios under light illumination or electric field. The migration in these systems is negligible compared to lead&#8208;halide perovskites owing to a higher ion migration activation energy (Ea). Using mixed lead&#8208;tin perovskites with different Ea, the threshold Ea for observation of ion migration in perovskite devices is determined to be around 0.65&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Ion migration is a notorious phenomenon observed in ionic perovskite materials. It causes several severe issues in perovskite optoelectronic devices such as instability, current hysteresis, and phase segregation. Here, we report that, in contrast to lead halide perovskites (LHPs), no ion migration or phase segregation was observed in tin halide perovskites (THPs) under illumination or an electric field. The origin is attributed to a much stronger Sn&#8208;halide bond and higher ion migration activation energy (Ea) in THPs, which remain nearly constant under illumination. We further figured out the threshold Ea for the absence of ion migration to be around 0.65&#8197;eV using the CsSnyPb1&#8208;y(I0.6Br0.4)3 system whose Ea varies with Sn ratios. Our work shows that ion migration does not necessarily exist in all perovskites and suggests metallic doping to be a promising way of stopping ion migration and improving the intrinsic stability of perovskites.

         <title>How Crystal Symmetry Dictates Non&#8208;Local Vibrational Circular Dichroism in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) is intimately linked to crystal symmetry and therefore has the capability to distinguish between polymorphic forms. In this article, we classify the non&#8208;local terms due to crystal chirality versus the local terms due to molecular chirality. We find that already an achiral screw axis leads to significant changes in the VCD spectrum that are intrinsic to the crystal structure.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) can be used to determine the absolute structure of chiral crystals, but its interpretation remains a challenge in modern spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate the effect of a twofold screw axis on the solid&#8208;state VCD spectrum in a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of P21 crystals of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;indanol. Even though the space group is achiral, a single proper symmetry operation has an important impact on the VCD spectrum, which reflects the supramolecular chirality of the crystal. Distinguishing between contributions originating from molecular chirality and from chiral crystal packing, we find that while IR absorption hardly depends on the symmetry of the space group, the situation is different for VCD, where completely new non&#8208;local patterns emerge. Understanding the two underlying mechanisms, namely gauge transport and direct coupling, will help to use VCD to distinguish polymorphic forms.

         <title>Tunable Latency of Hydrosilylation Catalyst by Ligand Density on Nanoparticle Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of norbornene ligands on silica nanoparticles alters the activity of a Pt hydrosilylation catalyst. Latency of hydrosilylation at high ligand density occurs despite the non&#8208;inhibitory behavior of the free ligand and establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of functionalized inorganic supports.







Abstract
Functionalizing inorganic particles with organic ligands is a common technique for heterogenizing organometallic catalysts. We describe how coordinating molecular platinum to silica nanoparticles functionalized with a high density of norbornene ligands causes unexpected latency of the catalytic activity in hydrosilylation reactions when compared to an identical reaction in which the norbornene is not tethered (2&#8201;% vs 97&#8201;% conversion in 1&#8197;h). Performing the hydrosilylation at elevated temperature (70&#8201;&#176;C) suppresses this activity delay, suggesting the usefulness of this technique towards temperature&#8208;triggered catalysis. We demonstrate that this latency is related to ligand density on the particle surface, chemical structure of the norbornene, and silica nanoparticle topology. We also establish the benefit of this latency for triggered curing of silicone elastomers. Overall, our work establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of inorganic supports when functionalized with organometallic complexes.

         <title>Reshaping the 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Active Site for Chemoselective Biosynthesis of Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of novel synthetic pathways into metabolic network is challenging. Empowered by protein engineering and synthetic biology, a whole&#8208;cell transformation process is reported to utilize engineered 2&#8208;pyrone synthase with novel reactivity in metabolic networks to convert carboxylic acids and intracellular malonyl&#8208;CoA directly into the pyrone products with high yields, catalytic efficiency and good selectivity.







Abstract
Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value&#8208;added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of E.&#8197;coli to produce high&#8208;value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of novel synthetic pathways into metabolic network is challenging. Empowered by protein engineering and synthetic biology, a whole-cell transformation process is reported to utilize engineered 2-pyrone synthase with novel reactivity in metabolic networks to convert carboxylic acids and intracellular malonyl-CoA directly into the pyrone products with high yields, catalytic efficiency and good selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2-pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value-added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; to produce high-value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen-bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization has been used to prepare a series of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthracene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. The size and shape of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton determines the unique features of the compounds&#8212;such as their face&#8208;to&#8208;face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character.







Abstract
Large &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are key in the area of molecular materials. Herein, we prepare via AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization a series of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthracene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. Their structural and optoelectronic properties were studied by several techniques, ranging from X&#8208;ray, UV/Vis, and cyclic voltammetry to transient absorption spectroscopy. As a complement, their electronic structures were explored by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the size and shape of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton, unique features&#8212;such as face&#8208;to&#8208;face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character&#8212;were noted. All in all, the aforementioned features render them valuable for technological applications.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding heteroditopic [2]catenanes exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, which has been exploited for the extraction of solid sodium or potassium halide salts into organic media. Changing the size of the component macrocycles dramatically influences the ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, and ion&#8208;pair complexation mode of the [2]catenanes.







Abstract
The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na+ template&#8208;directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor&#8208;containing macrocycles and acyclic bis&#8208;azide precursors, followed by a CuI&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction. Extensive 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies show the [2]catenane hosts exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, wherein XB&#8208;mediated halide recognition is enhanced by alkali metal cation pre&#8208;complexation. Notably, subtle changes in the catenanes&#8217; oligo(ethylene glycol) chain length dramatically alters their ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, complexation mode, and conformational dynamics. Solution&#8208;phase and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies provide evidence for competing host&#8208;separated and direct&#8208;contact ion&#8208;pair binding modes. We further demonstrate the [2]catenanes are capable of extracting solid alkali&#8208;metal halide salts into organic media.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Cobalt Catalyst for Low&#8208;Temperature Methanation at Low Partial Pressures of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/CeO2 is an efficient low&#8208;temperature methanation catalyst at CO2 partial pressures down to atmospheric concentrations. Advanced spectroscopic investigations unveiled that the combination of a higher concentration and higher intrinsic activity of active intermediates (formates and carbonyls) explains the high activity, emphasizing the role of the metal&#8208;ceria interface.







Abstract
The direct catalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 to valuable chemicals is a promising solution to avert negative consequences of rising CO2 concentration. However, heterogeneous catalysts efficient at low partial pressures of CO2 still need to be developed. Here, we explore Co/CeO2 as a catalyst for the methanation of diluted CO2 streams. This material displays an excellent performance at reaction temperatures as low as 175&#8201;&#176;C and CO2 partial pressures as low as 0.4&#8197;mbar (the atmospheric CO2 concentration). To gain mechanistic understanding of this unusual activity, we employed in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando infrared spectroscopy. The higher surface concentration and reactivity of formates and carbonyls&#8212;key reaction intermediates&#8212;explain the superior activity of Co/CeO2 as compared to a conventional Co/SiO2 catalyst. This work emphasizes the catalytic role of the cobalt&#8208;ceria interface and will aid in developing more efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Porosity and Charge Effects in a Supramolecular Porphyrin Cage Promote Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a supramolecular strategy to enhance photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO leveraging synergy between multiple second&#8208;sphere interactions. Post&#8208;synthetic click chemistry enables modular synthesis of porous porphyrin organic cages bearing 24 cationic groups. The coordinated use of both porosity and charge to augment CO2 reduction activity beyond additive effects results in fast and selective catalysis under low CO2 concentrations.







Abstract
We present a supramolecular approach to catalyzing photochemical CO2 reduction through second&#8208;sphere porosity and charge effects. An iron porphyrin box (PB) bearing 24 cationic groups, FePB&#8208;2(P), was made via post&#8208;synthetic modification of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized supramolecular synthon. FePB&#8208;2(P) promotes the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with 97&#8201;% selectivity for CO product, achieving turnover numbers (TON) exceeding 7000 and initial turnover frequencies (TOFmax) reaching 1400&#8197;min&#8722;1. The cooperativity between porosity and charge results in a 41&#8208;fold increase in activity relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) catalyst, which is far greater than analogs that augment catalysis through porosity (FePB&#8208;3(N), 4&#8208;fold increase) or charge (Fe p&#8208;tetramethylanilinium porphyrin (Fe&#8208;p&#8208;TMA), 6&#8208;fold increase) alone. This work establishes that synergistic pendants in the secondary coordination sphere can be leveraged as a design element to augment catalysis at primary active sites within confined spaces.

         <title>Potent De Novo Macrocyclic Peptides That Inhibit O&#8208;GlcNAc Transferase through an Allosteric Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) system led to macrocyclic peptide ligands of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). The most potent of these ligands bind to the tetratricopeptide repeat region of OGT and inhibit this enzyme in an allosteric manner, making them promising tool compounds for studying OGT.







Abstract
Glycosyltransferases are a superfamily of enzymes that are notoriously difficult to inhibit. Here we apply an mRNA display technology integrated with genetic code reprogramming, referred to as the RaPID (random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery) system, to identify macrocyclic peptides with high binding affinities for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). These macrocycles inhibit OGT activity through an allosteric mechanism that is driven by their binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT. Saturation mutagenesis in a maturation screen using 39 amino acids, including 22 non&#8208;canonical residues, led to an improved unnatural macrocycle that is &#8776;40&#8197;times more potent than the parent compound (Kiapp=1.5&#8197;nM). Subsequent derivatization delivered a biotinylated derivative that enabled one&#8208;step affinity purification of OGT from complex samples. The high potency and novel mechanism of action of these OGT ligands should enable new approaches to elucidate the specificity and regulation of OGT.

         <title>Co&#8208;Intercalation of Dual Charge Carriers in Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Confining Layered Vanadium Oxide Nanobelts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of metal confined nanomaterials by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The metal ions confined nanobelts can stabilize the layered structure, effectively control the interlayer spacing, and provide a more significant diffusion channel for the intercalation and deintercalation of Zn2+ without changing the oxide morphology.







Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based oxides with high theoretical specific capacities and open crystal structures are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this work, the confined synthesis can insert metal ions into the interlayer spacing of layered vanadium oxide nanobelts without changing the original morphology. Furthermore, we obtain a series of nanomaterials based on metal&#8208;confined nanobelts, and describe the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of the obtained Al2.65V6O13&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.07H2O as cathodes for AZIBs are remarkably improved with a high initial capacity of 571.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial capacity can still reach 205.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity retention of 89.2&#8201;% after 2000&#8197;cycles. This study demonstrates that nanobelts confined with metal ions can significantly improve energy storage applications, revealing new avenues for enhancing the electrochemical performance of AZIBs.

         <title>Autonomous Non&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;Assembly and Molecular Movements Powered by Electrical Energy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling the potential of two electrodes simultaneously, a strategy has been implemented that uses electrical energy to drive self&#8208;assembling systems away from equilibrium. The proposed approach has been demonstrated by modulating the self&#8208;assembly of a calix[6]arene host with a viologen guest, using a scanning electrochemical microscope setup. High thermodynamic efficiencies are obtained.







Abstract
The ability to exploit energy autonomously is one of the hallmarks of life. Mastering such processes in artificial nanosystems can open technological opportunities. In the last decades, light&#8208; and chemically driven autonomous systems have been developed in relation to conformational motion and self&#8208;assembly, mostly in relation to molecular motors. In contrast, despite electrical energy being an attractive energy source to power nanosystems, its autonomous harnessing has received little attention. Herein we consider an operation mode that allows the autonomous exploitation of electrical energy by a self&#8208;assembling system. Threading and dethreading motions of a pseudorotaxane take place autonomously in solution, powered by the current flowing between the electrodes of a scanning electrochemical microscope. The underlying autonomous energy ratchet mechanism drives the self&#8208;assembly steps away from equilibrium with a higher energy efficiency compared to other autonomous systems. The strategy is general and might be extended to other redox&#8208;driven systems.

         <title>Ru3(CO)12&#8208;Catalyzed Modular Assembly of Hemilabile Ligands by C&#8722;H Activation of Phosphines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation of monodentate phosphines has been developed for modular assembly of bidentate hemilabile ligands. The use of mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid (MPAA) ligands is crucial for the inhibition of catalyst poisoning.







Abstract
Hemilabile ligands have been applied extensively in transition metal catalysis, but preparations of these molecules typically require multistep synthesis. Here, modular assembly of diverse phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, including related axially chiral compounds, is first reported through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of phosphines with isocyanate directed by phosphorus(III) atoms. High reactivity and regioselectivity can be obtained by using a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst with a mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid ligand. This transformation significantly expands the pool of phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, some of which have shown excellent efficiency for asymmetric catalysis. More broadly, the discovery constitutes a proof of principle for facile construction of hemilabile ligands directly from the parent monodentate phosphines by C&#8722;H activation with ideal atom, step and redox economy. Several dinuclear ruthenium complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

         <title>Stabilizing Cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathodes through Oxygen Lattice Regulation by Two&#8208;phase Ru Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping on voltage decay using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. A mechanistic transition from a C2/c phase to a R
m phase is reported for the first time. The best voltage retention for Co&#8208;free LNMO to date (decay rate &lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle) has been achieved.







Abstract
The application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides is hindered by their dramatic capacity and voltage decay on cycling. This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping. A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. The two&#8208;phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O2&#8722;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle), and a high capacity&#8208;retention rate during long&#8208;term cycling. The understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationship of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of Li-rich layered oxides is hindered by their dramatic capacity and voltage decay on cycling. This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt-free Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and demonstrates the positive impact of two-phase Ru doping. A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post-mortem synchrotron analyses. The two-phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &amp;lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle), and a high capacity-retention rate during long-term cycling. The understanding of the structure-function relationship of Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better-performance Li-rich layered oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unsymmetrically Chlorinated Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptor Leads to High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have been developed. The halogen substituents on the aromatic side chains, as the new structure design tools, not only facilitate the construction of 3D stacks in solid, but also optimize the optoelectronic properties of the NFREAs, leading to organic solar cells with 16.2&#8201;% efficiency and excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Searching the cost&#8208;effective organic semiconductors is strongly needed in order to facilitate the practice of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet to be fulfilled. Herein, we have succeeded in developing two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), leading to the highest efficiency of 16.2&#8201;% for the NFREA derived OSCs. These OSCs exhibit the superior operational stabilities under one sun equivalent illumination without ultraviolet (UV) filtration. It is revealed that the modulation of halogen substituents on aromatic side chains, as the new structural tool to tune the intermolecular interaction and optoelectronic properties of acceptors, not only promotes the interlocked tic&#8208;tac&#8208;toe frame of three&#8208;dimensional stacks in solid, but also improves charge dynamics of acceptors to enable high&#8208;performance and stable OSCs.

         <title>Furan&#8208;Extended Helical Rylenes with Fjord Edge Topology and Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthetic strategy is reported for preparing lateral furan&#8208;extended rylenes bearing multifold O&#8208;doping and fjord edge topology. The resultant rylenes display fjord edge length dependent electronic structures and properties. The higher congener witnesses an open&#8208;shell structure and remarkable optoelectronic characteristics such as red&#8208;shifting and NIR&#8208;absorbing capacities, as well as pronounced mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism of chiral diradicaloids.







Abstract
Lateral furan&#8208;expansion of polycyclic aromatics, which enables multiple O&#8208;doping and peripheral edge evolution of rylenes, is developed for the first time. Tetrafuranylperylene TPF&#8208;4CN and octafuranylquaterrylene OFQ&#8208;8CN were prepared as model compounds bearing unique fjord edge topology and helical conformations. Compared to TPF&#8208;4CN, the higher congener OFQ&#8208;8CN displays a largely red&#8208;shifted (&#8776;333&#8197;nm) and intensified absorption band (&#955;max=829&#8197;nm) as well as a narrowed electrochemical band gap (&#8776;1.08&#8197;eV) due to its pronounced &#960;&#8208;delocalization and emerging of open&#8208;shell diradicaloid upon the increase of fjord edge length. Moreover, strong circular dichroism signals in a broad range until 900&#8197;nm are observed for open&#8208;shell chiral OFQ&#8208;8CN, owing to the excellent conformational stability of its central bis(tetraoxa[5]helicene) fragments. Our studies provide insights into the relationships between edge topologies and (chir)optoelectronic properties for this novel type of O&#8208;doped PAHs.

         <title>Charge Density Overcomes Steric Hindrance of Ferrocene Surfactant in Switchable Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double head ferrocene surfactant (Fc+N+C12) can stabilize switchable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions in combination with positively charged alumina nanoparticles. Not only can reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions be achieved by redox reactions, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be achieved by pH trigger.







Abstract
A ferrocene surfactant can be switched between single and double head form (FcN+C12/Fc+N+C12) triggered by redox reaction. FcN+C12 can neither stabilize an O/W emulsion alone nor an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion in combination with alumina nanoparticles due to the steric hindrance of the ferrocene group. However, such steric hindrance can be overcome by increasing the charge density in Fc+N+C12, so that oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions can be co&#8208;stabilized by Fc+N+C12 and alumina nanoparticles at very low concentrations (1&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M (&#8776;50&#8197;ppb) and 0.001&#8197;wt&#8201;%, respectively). Not only can reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions be achieved by redox reaction, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be obtained through reversing the charge of alumina particles by adjusting the pH. The results provide a new protocol for the design of surfactants for stabilization of smart oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions.

         <title>(BO)2&#8208;Doped Tetrathia[7]helicene: A Configurationally Stable Blue Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO&#8208;doped thiahelicene has been synthesized by a four&#8208;step procedure and its optoelectronic and chiroptical properties investigated. The incorporation of two B&#8722;O bonds into the tetrathia[7]helicene framework has resulted in a configurationally stable (&#916;Genant&#8800;=27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) blue emitter (&#934;PL=6&#8201;%).







Abstract
Helicenes combine two central themes in chemistry: extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and chirality. Hetero&#8208;atom doping preserves both characteristics and allows modulation of the electronic structure of a helicene. Herein, we report the (BO)2&#8208;doped tetrathia[7]helicene 1, which was prepared from 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in four steps. 1 is formally derived by substituting two (Mes)B&#8722;O moieties in place of (H)C=C(H) fragments in two benzene rings of the parent tetrathia[7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a dihedral angle of 50.26(9)&#176; between the two terminal thiophene rings. The (P)&#8208;/(M)&#8208;1 enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The circular dichroism spectra of (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;1 show a perfect mirror&#8208;image relationship. 1 is a blue emitter (&#955;em=411&#8197;nm) with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of &#934;PL=6&#8201;% (cf. tetrathia[7]helicene: &#955;em&#8776;405&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=5&#8201;%).

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helicenes combine two central themes in chemistry: extended &#960;-conjugation and chirality. Hetero-atom doping preserves both characteristics and allows modulation of the electronic structure of a helicene. Herein, we report the (BO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-doped tetrathia[7]helicene &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, which was prepared from 2-methoxy-3,3&#8242;-bithiophene in four steps. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is formally derived by substituting two (Mes)B&#8722;O moieties in place of (H)C=C(H) fragments in two benzene rings of the parent tetrathia[7]helicene. X-ray crystallography revealed a dihedral angle of 50.26(9)&#176; between the two terminal thiophene rings. The (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-/(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The circular dichroism spectra of (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; show a perfect mirror-image relationship. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a blue emitter (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Interbacterial Chemical Communication&#8208;Triggered Nascent Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>

The CAPPEX strategy enables communication&#8208;triggered nascent proteomic analysis in complex bacterial populations. Applying CAPPEX, a tryptophan&#8208;indole axis that contributes to the colonization resistance of commensal E. coli to Salmonella was discovered.







Abstract
Metabolic labeling with clickable noncanonical amino acids has enabled nascent proteome profiling, which can be performed in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. However, nascent proteomics in an intercellular communication&#8208;dependent manner remains challenging. Here we develop communication&#8208;activated profiling of protein expression (CAPPEX), which integrates the LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing circuit with the cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific nascent proteomics method to enable selective click&#8208;labeling of newly synthesized proteins in a specific bacterium upon receiving chemical signals from another reporter bacterium. CAPPEX reveals that E. coli competes with Salmonella for tryptophan as the precursor for indole, and the resulting indole suppressed the expression of virulence factors in Salmonella. This tryptophan&#8208;indole axis confers attenuation of Salmonella invasion in host cells and living mice. The CAPPEX strategy should be widely applicable for investigating various interbacterial communication processes.

Pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanofiber with oxygen vacancies is proposed as an efficient electrocatalyst for reducing nitrate to ammonia, which achieves a large NH3 yield of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%.

It also shows excellent electrochemical durability and structural stability. Theoretical calculation reveals the enhanced conductivity of this catalyst and an extremely low free energy of &#8722;0.28&#8197;eV for nitrate adsorption at the presence of vacant oxygen.

         <title>Manipulating OH&#8722;&#8208;Mediated Anode&#8208;Cathode Cross&#8208;Communication Toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative concept of manipulating anode&#8208;cathode interplay for cycling durability improvement is demonstrated by employing Al2(SO4)3 as electrolyte additive. The suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn and NVO by Al2(SO4)3 simultaneously stabilize the two electrodes, even under ultra&#8208;acidic environment (pH&#8776;0.9). The as&#8208;assembled Zn||NVO batteries exhibit satisfactory lifespan at both low and high scan rates.







Abstract
The anode&#8208;cathode interplay is an important but rarely considered factor that initiates the degradation of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, to address the limited cyclability issue of V&#8208;based AZIBs, Al2(SO4)3 is proposed as decent electrolyte additive to manipulate OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn anode and NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O (NVO) cathode. The hydrolysis of Al3+ creates a pH&#8776;0.9 strong acidic environment, which unexpectedly prolongs the anode lifespan from 200 to 1000&#8197;h. Such impressive improvement is assigned to the alleviation of interfacial OH&#8722; accumulation by Al3+ adsorption and solid electrolyte interphase formation. Accordingly, the strongly acidified electrolyte, associated with the sedated crossover of anodic OH&#8722; toward NVO, remarkably mitigate its undesired dissolution and phase transition. The interrupted OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated communication between the two electrodes endows Zn||NVO batteries with superb cycling stability, at both low and high scan rates.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Preussomerins: Control of Spiroacetal Stereogenicity by Photochemical Reaction of a Naphthoquinone through 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical reactions of naphthoquinones triggered by 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer have been developed. This reaction proceeds in stereospecific manner without loss of the stereochemical information of the substrate, enabling the enantioselective total synthesis of preussomerin EGs. The constructed spiroacetal center is the sole stereogenic center in the product, which had been previously impossible to set by exploiting conventional methods.







Abstract
We report the enantioselective total syntheses of preussomerins EG1, EG2, and EG3. The key transformation is a stereospecific photochemical reaction involving 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to achieve retentive replacement of a C&#8722;H with a C&#8722;O bond, enabling otherwise&#8208;difficult control of the spiroacetal stereogenic center.

         <title>Boosting the Activity of Pd Single Atoms by Tuning Their Local Environment on Ceria for Methane Combustion</title>

For Pd/ceria single atom catalysts, a thermal treatment to the ceria support prior to Pd deposition induces the formation of Pd&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) single sites that are highly active for CH4 oxidation.







Abstract
Supported Pd single atom catalysts (SACs) have triggered great research interest in methane combustion yet with contradicting views on their activity and stability. Here, we show that the Pd SAs can take different electronic structure and atomic geometry on ceria support, resulting in different catalytic properties. By a simple thermal pretreatment to ceria prior to Pd deposition, a unique anchoring site is created. The Pd SA, taking this site, can be activated to Pd&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) that has greatly enhanced activity for methane oxidation: T50 lowered by up to 130&#8201;&#176;C and almost 10 times higher turnover frequency compared to the untreated catalyst. The enhanced activity of Pd&#948;+ site is related to its oxygen&#8208;deficient local structure and elongated interacting distance with ceria, leading to enhanced capability in delivering reactive oxygen species and decomposing reaction intermediates. This work provides insights into designing highly efficient Pd SACs for oxidation reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Tellurium&#8208;Based Chalcogen Bonding: Photocontrolled Anion Binding and Anion Abstraction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding receptor has been constructed in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The receptor shows photocontrolled halide anion binding and acts as a photocontrolled organocatalyst for chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted halide anion abstraction in a Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction.







Abstract
Exploring new noncovalent bonding motifs with reversibly tunable binding affinity is of fundamental importance in manipulating the properties and functions of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly systems and materials. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a unique visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazole/triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding (ChB) system in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The binding strengths between these azo&#8208;derived ChB receptors and the halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) could be reversibly regulated upon irradiation by visible light of different wavelengths. The cis&#8208;bidentate ChB receptors exhibit enhanced halide anion binding ability compared to the trans&#8208;monodentate receptors. In particular, the telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based ChB receptor can achieve both high and significantly photoswitchable binding affinities for halide anions, which enable it to serve as an efficient photocontrolled organocatalyst for ChB&#8208;assisted halide abstraction in a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation benchmark reaction.

         <title>Single Atom Ring Contraction of Peptide Macrocycles Using Cornforth Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The notion of late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective chemistry to modify chemical structures is of growing interest and utility. Here, we perform a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in macrocyclic backbones using the Cornforth rearrangement. This chemistry could be used to rapidly access unique chemical space which would be difficult to achieve using a standard building block approach.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective transformations of densely functionalized scaffolds have been a topic of intense interest in chemical synthesis. Herein we have repurposed the rarely used Cornforth rearrangement as a tool to effect a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in cyclic peptide backbones. Investigations into the kinetics of the rearrangement were carried out to understand the impact of electronic factors, ring size, and linker type on the reaction efficiency. Conformational analysis was undertaken and showed how subtle differences in the peptide backbone result in substrate&#8208;dependent reaction profiles. This methodology can now be used to perform conformation&#8208;activity studies. The chemistry also offers an opportunity to install building blocks that are not compatible with traditional C&#8208;to&#8208;N iterative synthesis of macrocycle precursors.

         <title>Surface Curvature Dominated Guest&#8208;Induced Nonequilibrium Deformations of Single Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;300 Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach allows the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual covalent organic framework COF&#8208;300 crystals to be monitored in situ in real time. The spatiotemporal resolution of DFM allows transient and nonequilibrium intermediate states to be investigated, revealing the diverse surface&#8208;curvature&#8208;driven adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane.







Abstract
Understanding the guest&#8208;induced dynamic deformation process of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is vitally important to further increase their stimulus&#8208;response performances. Here we report on the dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach to in situ monitor the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual COF&#8208;300 crystals in real time. We observe not only transient and nonequilibrium intermediate deformation states but also local surface curvature&#8208;driven diverse adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane (DCM), undergoing one, two, and multiple expansion&#8208;contraction deformations as well as contraction&#8208;to&#8208;expansion transition. The surface curvature&#8208;dominated deformations are ascribed to the significant differences in the adsorption capacity for DCM at the curved tip and flat side regions, in which DCM can be adsorbed preferentially by curved tip regions of COF&#8208;300.

         <title>Blending to Make Nonhealable Polymers Healable: Nanophase Separation Observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending with only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of PTUEG3 resulted in making PTUC8 to be self&#8208;healable at ambient temperatures without spoiling its non&#8208;hygroscopic properties. A nanophase&#8208;separated structure as observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy is responsible: PTUEG3&#8208;rich domains certainly contribute to the self&#8208;healing properties, while PTUC8&#8208;rich non&#8208;hygroscopic domains likely prevent the polymer blend from humidity&#8208;induced plasticization.







Abstract
Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self&#8208;healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG3; Tg=27&#8201;&#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self&#8208;heal even at 12&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC8; Tg=50&#8201;&#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG3, cannot heal below 92&#8201;&#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self&#8208;healed in a temperature range above 32&#8201;&#176;C even when its PTUEG3 content was only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Unlike PTUEG3 alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non&#8208;hygroscopic nature of the PTUC8 component. CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase&#8208;separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG3 provided the polymer blend with humidity&#8208;tolerant self&#8208;healable properties.

     alt="Blending to Make Nonhealable Polymers Healable: Nanophase Separation Observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR Analysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blending with only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; resulted in making PTUC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to be self-healable at ambient temperatures without spoiling its non-hygroscopic properties. A nanophase-separated structure as observed by CP/MAS &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy is responsible: PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-rich domains certainly contribute to the self-healing properties, while PTUC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-rich non-hygroscopic domains likely prevent the polymer blend from humidity-induced plasticization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self-healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=27&#8201;&#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self-heal even at 12&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=50&#8201;&#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, cannot heal below 92&#8201;&#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self-healed in a temperature range above 32&#8201;&#176;C even when its PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; content was only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Unlike PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non-hygroscopic nature of the PTUC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; component. CP/MAS &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase-separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; provided the polymer blend with humidity-tolerant self-healable properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Borylation of Alkynes and Vinylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective remote borylation of internal alkynes and sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates enabled by rhodium catalysis is reported. The 1,n&#8208;diboronate products can be converted to a variety of useful building blocks, biologically active molecules, and drugs via the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products including the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.







Abstract
Remote functionalization involving a fascinating chain&#8208;walking process has emerged as a powerful strategy for the rapid access to value&#8208;added functional molecules from readily available feedstocks. However, the scope of current methods is predominantly limited to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes. The remote functionalization of multi&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is challenging, and the use of alkynes in the chain walking is unexplored. We herein report a rhodium catalyzed remote borylation of internal alkynes, offering an unprecedented reaction mode of alkynes for the preparation of synthetically valuable 1,n&#8208;diboronates. The regioselective distal migratory hydroboration of sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates is also demonstrated to furnish various multi&#8208;boronic esters. Synthetic utilities are highlighted through the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products such as the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.

         <title>Actinorhodin Biosynthesis Terminates with an Unprecedented Biaryl Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last dimerization step of actinorhodin (ACT) biosynthesis was established through biochemical studies. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the biaryl&#8208;coupling reaction using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. ActVA&#8208;ORF3 is a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that forms DHK&#8208;OH and ACT. The present results complete the functional assignment of essential enzymes for ACT biosynthesis.







Abstract
A plethora of dimeric natural products exist with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. A major strategy for dimerization is aryl coupling catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or laccase. Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has a dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone structure connected by a C&#8722;C bond. In this study, we identified an NmrA&#8208;family dimerizing enzyme, ActVA&#8208;ORF4, and a cofactor&#8208;independent oxidase, ActVA&#8208;ORF3, both involved in the last step of ACT biosynthesis. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. On the other hand, ActVA&#8208;ORF3 was found to be a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that produces the coupling substrate, DHK&#8208;OH and the final product, ACT. Consequently, the functional assignment of all essential enzymes in the biosynthesis of ACT, one of the best&#8208;known model natural products, has been completed.

         <title>A Photoinduced, Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction for the Stereoselective Assembly of C&#8208;Linked Glycosides and Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyst mediated the union of glycosyl halides and redox&#8208;active derivatives of carboxylic acids and amines to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides diastereoselectively under photoinduced conditions. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction of glycosyl nickel species with alkyl radicals generated by visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted fragmentation of EDA complexes is amenable to the late&#8208;stage glycosylation of complex bioactive molecules and oligopeptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Alkyl glycosides and glycoproteins exist in natural products and are prized for their role as carbohydrate mimics in drug design. However, a practical strategy that merges glycosyl donors with readily accessible reagents, derived from abundant carboxylic acid and amine feedstocks, is yet to be conceived. Herein, we show that a nickel catalyst promotes C&#8722;C coupling between glycosyl halides and aliphatic acids or primary amines (converted into redox&#8208;active electrophiles in one step), in the presence of Hantzsch ester and LiI (or Et3N) under blue LED illumination to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies support the photoinduced formation of alkyl radicals that react with a glycosyl nickel species generated in situ to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling. Through this manifold, innate CO2H and NH2 motifs embedded within amino acids and oligopeptides are selectively capped and functionalized to afford glycopeptide conjugates through late&#8208;stage glycosylation.

         <title>f&#8208;block MOFs: A Pathway to Heterometallic Transuranics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like baking cookies to personal taste, preparation of a library of heterometallic actinide&#8208;MOFs allows for tailoring of the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of material properties. Mixing the radionuclide ingredients in proper ratios reveals structure&#8211;property relationships and unique design principles for new classes of actinide&#8208;based materials. In addition, the prepared frameworks provide a recipe for novel, pre&#8208;designed transuranic MOFs.







Abstract
A novel series of heterometallic f&#8208;block&#8208;frameworks including the first examples of transuranic heterometallic 238U/239Pu&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and a novel monometallic 239Pu&#8208;analog are reported. In combination with theoretical calculations, we probed the kinetics and thermodynamics of heterometallic actinide(An)&#8208;MOF formation and reported the first value of a U&#8208;to&#8208;Th transmetallation rate. We concluded that formation of uranyl species could be a driving force for solid&#8208;state metathesis. Density of states near the Fermi edge, enthalpy of formation, band gap, proton affinity, and thermal/chemical stability were probed as a function of metal ratios. Furthermore, we achieved 97&#8201;% of the theoretical maximum capacity for An&#8208;integration. These studies shed light on fundamental aspects of actinide chemistry and also foreshadow avenues for the development of emerging classes of An&#8208;containing materials, including radioisotope thermoelectric generators or metalloradiopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Assisted Coupling Manipulation for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface reconfiguration methodology (SRM) is reported for the first time as a general approach to tune the coupling between hybrid FAPbI3 perovskite QDs, which is exploited for improved charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and PV devices, leading to a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite QD solar cell.







Abstract
For emerging perovskite quantum dots (QDs), understanding the surface features and their impact on the materials and devices is becoming increasingly urgent. In this family, hybrid FAPbI3 QDs (FA: formamidium) exhibit higher ambient stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption and sufficient carrier lifetime. However, hybrid QDs suffer from difficulty in modulating surface ligand, which is essential for constructing conductive QD arrays for photovoltaics. Herein, assisted by an ionic liquid formamidine thiocyanate, we report a facile surface reconfiguration methodology to modulate surface and manipulate electronic coupling of FAPbI3 QDs, which is exploited to enhance charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and photovoltaic devices. Finally, a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15&#8201;% is achieved for FAPbI3 QD solar cells, and they retain over 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8211;30&#8201;% humidity, 25&#8201;&#176;C) for over 600&#8197;h.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Nanobarrel that Hosts and Solubilizes C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows and a diameter of 12.7&#8197;&#197; has been synthesized that is optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, and results in stable solutions of C60.







Abstract
Organic cages have gained increasing attention in recent years as molecular hosts and porous materials. Among these, barrel&#8208;shaped cages or molecular nanobarrels are promising systems to encapsulate large hosts as they possess windows of the same size as their internal cavity. However, these systems have received little attention and remain practically unexplored despite their potential. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows with a diameter of 12.7&#8197;&#197; optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, providing stable solutions of C60.

         <title>Design of a Fully Non&#8208;Fused Bulk Heterojunction toward Efficient and Low&#8208;Cost Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>

Incorporation of a strong polar substituent on a non&#8208;fused acceptor core can help to reduce donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8201;:&#8201;A) miscibility, leading to optimized D&#8201;:&#8201;A morphology and domain purity in fully non&#8208;fused organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Using this approach, high&#8208;efficient and stable OPV cells are achieved.







Abstract
To modulate the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials both possessing fully non&#8208;fused ring structures, a series of electron acceptors (A4T&#8208;16, A4T&#8208;31 and A4T&#8208;32) with different polar functional substituents were synthesized and investigated. The three acceptors show good planarity, high conformational stability, complementary absorption and energy levels with the non&#8208;fused polymer donor (PTVT&#8208;BT). Among them, A4T&#8208;32 possesses the strongest polar functional group and shows the highest surface energy, which facilitates morphological modulation in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approaching 16.0&#8201;% and a superior fill factor over 0.795 are achieved in the PTVT&#8208;BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non&#8208;fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains &#8776;84&#8201;% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000&#8197;h under the continuous simulated 1&#8208;sun&#8208;illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT&#8208;BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6&#8201;%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non&#8208;fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.

         <title>Benchmark Dynamics of Dipolar Molecular Rotors in Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8208;MOF, constructed with a wheelshaped ligand containing geminal rotating fluorine atoms shows a fluid configuration landscape in crystals, even at 2&#8197;K. The multiple configurational interchanges that arise from a correlated cascade mechanism propagating through the structure, as shown by Molecular Dynamics, phonon calculations and NMR relaxation, occur even at temperatures that usually prohibit any dipole rotation.







Abstract
Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel&#8208;shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2&#8197;K, with practically null activation energy (Ea=17&#8197;cal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). 1H T1 NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole&#8208;rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction at 4&#8197;K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized&#8208;Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal. Dynamic materials under limited thermal noise and high responsiveness enable the fabrication of molecular machines with low energy dissipation and controllable dynamics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Translation of Different mRNAs in Cells via Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Photouncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coumarin&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable 5&#8242; cap analog (CouCap) was synthesized and incorporated into mRNA. In combination with a nitropiperonyl&#8208;protected 5&#8242; cap analog, translation of multiple mRNAs can now be activated by light of different wavelengths. No mRNA sequence nor chemical modifications remain after photo&#8208;cleavage.







Abstract
The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo&#8208;cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo&#8208;cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7&#8208;(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap&#8208;mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450&#8197;nm. The native cap is restored and no non&#8208;natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin&#8208; and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable groups.

     alt="Light-Activated Translation of Different mRNAs in Cells via Wavelength-Dependent Photouncaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coumarin-based photo-cleavable 5&#8242; cap analog (CouCap) was synthesized and incorporated into mRNA. In combination with a nitropiperonyl-protected 5&#8242; cap analog, translation of multiple mRNAs can now be activated by light of different wavelengths. No mRNA sequence nor chemical modifications remain after photo-cleavage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo-cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo-cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7-(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap-mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450&#8197;nm. The native cap is restored and no non-natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin- and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl-based photo-cleavable groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Nanoparticles Protected by Chainmail&#8208;structured Graphene for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin graphene nanosheet layers were created as chainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticles (Fe@Gnc) using a simple hydrothermal method and in situ thermal reduction strategy, which can achieve nitrate reduction to nitrogen. The designed graphene nanochainmail protects the internal iron active sites and has excellent stability and durability over 40 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an appealing technology for regulating the nitrogen cycle. Metallic iron is one of the well&#8208;known electrocatalysts for NO3RR, but it suffers from poor durability due to leaching and oxidation of iron during the electrocatalytic process. In this work, a graphene&#8208;nanochainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticle (Fe@Gnc) electrocatalyst is reported. It displays superior nitrate removal efficiency and high nitrogen selectivity. Notably, the catalyst delivers exceptional stability and durability, with the nitrate removal rate and nitrogen selectivity remained &#8776;96&#8201;% of that of the first time after up to 40 cycles (24&#8197;h for one cycle). As expected, the conductive graphene nanochainmail provides robust protection for the internal iron active sites, allowing Fe@Gnc to maintain its long&#8208;lasting electrochemical nitrate catalytic activity. This research proposes a workable solution for the scientific challenge of poor lasting ability of iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts in large&#8208;scale industrialization.

A lyophilized preparation of an unspecific peroxygenase variant from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H) is a highly effective catalyst for the oxygenation of a diverse range of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. Scalable, high yielding and enantioselective biocatalytic oxygenations have been developed, including 27 preparative examples (ca. 100&#8197;mg scale) across a wide range of substrates, including alkyl pyridines, bicyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and indoles.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Upgrading to Triethanolamine by Bromine&#8208;Assisted C2H4 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2 upgrading strategy was developed by using Br&#8208;assisted C2H4 oxidation, which exploits the preferential adsorption of *Br over *OH on metal phthalocyanine electrocatalysts. The C2H4 oxidation was further coupled with the nitrite reduction to form triethanolamine. Using two electrolysis cells in tandem, the capability of electrochemical fixation of CO2 and nitrite ions into triethanolamine at ambient conditions was demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is a promising approach for converting this greenhouse gas into value&#8208;added chemicals, while the capability of producing products with longer carbon chains (Cn&gt;3) is limited. Herein, we demonstrate the Br&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene (C2H4), a major CO2 electroreduction product, into 2&#8208;bromoethanol by electro&#8208;generated bromine on metal phthalocyanine catalysts. Due to the preferential formation of Br2 over *O or Cl2 to activate the C=C bond, a high partial current density of producing 2&#8208;bromoethanol (46.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2) was obtained with 87.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. Further coupling with the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to ammonia at the cathode allowed the production of triethanolamine with six carbon atoms. Moreover, by coupling a CO2 electrolysis cell for in situ C2H4 generation and a C2H4 oxidation/nitrite reduction cell, the capability of upgrading of CO2 and nitrite into triethanolamine was demonstrated.

         <title>A Conformational Restriction Strategy for the Control of CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing with Photoactivatable Guide RNAs
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the discovery and development of conformationally restricted guide RNA, a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized molecule that can be easily prepared with only two or three modification sites. This is a superior approach for the spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas editing, which has enabled the precise cleavage of exogenous genes at a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakages in live cells and in embryos.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is one of the most powerful tools for gene editing. However, approaches for precise control of genome editing and regulatory events are still desirable. Here, we report the spatiotemporal and efficient control of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208; and Cas12a&#8208;mediated editing with conformationally restricted guide RNAs (gRNAs). This approach relied on only two or three pre&#8208;installed photo&#8208;labile substituents followed by an intramolecular cyclization, representing a robust synthetic method in comparison to the heavily modified linear gRNAs that often require extensive screening and time&#8208;consuming optimization. This tactic could direct the precise cleavage of the genes encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) protein within a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakage in live cells. We also achieved light&#8208;mediated myostatin (MSTN) gene editing in embryos, wherein a new bow&#8208;knot&#8208;type gRNA was constructed with excellent OFF/ON switch efficiency. Overall, our work provides a significant new strategy in CRISPR/Cas editing with modified circular gRNAs to precisely manipulate where and when genes are edited.

         <title>Continuous Modulation of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activities of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts through p&#8208;n Junction Rectification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;n junction single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) was designed by exploiting the p&#8208;type semiconducting character of the SAC having a metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors. Simply changing the n&#8208;type support material for ones with a different work function allows continuous, controllable modification of the electronic structure and intrinsic activity of catalytically active single&#8208;atom site.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to surpass their activity limit remains challenging at their atomic scale. Herein, we exploit p&#8208;type semiconducting character of SACs having a metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors (MeNx) and rectify their local charge density by an n&#8208;type semiconductor support. With iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as a model SAC, introducing an n&#8208;type gallium monosulfide that features a low work function generates a space&#8208;charged region across the junction interface, and causes distortion of the FeN4 moiety and spin&#8208;state transition in the FeII center. This catalyst shows an over two&#8208;fold higher specific oxygen&#8208;reduction activity than that of pristine FePc. We further employ three other n&#8208;type metal chalcogenides of varying work function as supports, and discover a linear correlation between the activities of the supported FeN4 and the rectification degrees, which clearly indicates that SACs can be continuously tuned by this rectification strategy.

         <title>Catalytic DNA&#8208;Assisted Mass Production of Arbitrary Single&#8208;Stranded DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on two newly identified classes of DNAzymes, we developed paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (PECAN) for mass production of scar&#8208;free single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). We demonstrated the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for in situ RNA detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage, and highlighted the advantages of using high&#8208;quality PECAN ssDNA in cutting&#8208;edge biotechnology.







Abstract
Synthetic single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is a cornerstone for life and materials science, yet the purity, quantity, length, and customizability of synthetic DNA are still limiting in various applications. Here, we present PECAN, paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (DNA enzymes or deoxyribozymes), which enables mass production of ssDNA of arbitrary sequence (up to 7000 nucleotides, or nt) with single&#8208;base precision. At the core of PECAN technique are two newly identified classes of DNAzymes, each robustly self&#8208;hydrolyzing with minimal sequence requirement up&#8208; or down&#8208;stream of its cleavage site. Flanking the target ssDNA with a pair of such DNAzymes generates a precursor ssDNA amplifiable by pseudogene&#8208;recombinant bacteriophage, which subsequently releases the target ssDNA in large quantities after efficient auto&#8208;processing. PECAN produces ssDNA of virtually any terminal bases and compositions with &gt;98.5&#8201;% purity at the milligram&#8208;to&#8208;gram scale. We demonstrate the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for RNA in situ detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage.

         <title>Zincophilic Electrode Interphase with Appended Proton Reservoir Ability Stabilizes Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protective coating is constructed on the Zn anodes (ZP@Zn), where the anionic group with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric characteristics achieves the reversible proton storage and accelerates the desolvation kinetics on the anode surface, thereby mitigating the parasitic side reactions derived from water, and facilitating homogeneous Zn nucleation and growth concomitantly.







Abstract
The rampant dendrites and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) resulting from the turbulent interfacial evolution at the anode/electrolyte are the main culprits of short lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal batteries. In this work, a versatile protective coating with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric features is constructed on the surface of Zn metal (ZP@Zn) as dendrite&#8208;free anodes. This kind of protective coating possesses the advantages of reversible proton storage and rapid desolvation kinetics, thereby mitigating the HER and facilitating homogeneous nucleation concomitantly. Furthermore, the space charge polarization effect promotes charge redistribution to achieve uniform Zn deposition. Accordingly, the ZP@Zn symmetric cell manifests excellent reversibility at an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 4700&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling at 80&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD). The ZP@Zn//V6O13 pouch cell also reveals superior cycling stability with a high capacity of 326.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode in a Dilute Aqueous Electrolyte Enabled by a pH Buffer Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, NH4H2PO4, is proposed to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions in a dilute aqueous electrolyte. Due to the pH buffer chemistry of NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; and the &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; of NH4+, promoted Coulombic efficiencies and lifespans of Zn based symmetric/asymmetric cells can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have drawn increasing attention due to the intrinsic safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density. However, parasitic reactions and non&#8208;uniform dendrite growth on the Zn anode side impede their application. Herein, a multifunctional additive, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NHP), is introduced to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions. The results show that the NH4+ tends to be preferably absorbed on the Zn surface to form a &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; and blocks the direct contact of water with Zn. Moreover, NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; jointly maintain pH values of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the NHP additive enables highly reversible Zn plating/stripping behaviors in Zn//Zn and Zn//Cu cells. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of Zn//MnO2 full cells and Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitors are improved. This work provides an efficient and general strategy for modifying Zn plating/stripping behaviors and suppressing side reactions in mild aqueous electrolyte.

One&#8208;electron reduction of the C2&#8208;biphenylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolinium cation (2&#8201;a+) affords the radical 3&#8201;a, which undergoes further 1e&#8208;reduction to yield the anion 4&#8201;a&#8722;. In the solid&#8208;state, 3&#8201;a is monomeric while 4&#8201;a&#8208;K has a hexameric tubular structure. In addition to 3&#8201;a and 4&#8201;a&#8208;K, synthesis, structures, and reactivity of stable radicals and anions based on unsaturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene frameworks have been presented.







Abstract
Herein, the first stable anions K[SIPrBp] (4&#8201;a&#8208;K) and K[IPrBp] (4&#8201;b&#8208;K) (SIPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CH2}2, IPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Bp=4&#8208;PhC6H4; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) derived from classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (i.e. SIPr and IPr) have been isolated as violet crystalline solids. 4&#8201;a&#8208;K and 4&#8201;b&#8208;K are prepared by KC8 reduction of the neutral radicals [SIPrBp] (3&#8201;a) and [IPrBp] (3&#8201;b), respectively. The radicals 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b as well as [Me&#8208;IPrBp] 3&#8201;c (Me&#8208;IPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CMe}2) are accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of the respective 1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides (SIPrBp)Br (2&#8201;a), (IPrBp)Br (2&#8201;b), and (Me&#8722;IPrBp)Br (2&#8201;c) with KC8. The cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c exhibit two one&#8208;electron reversible redox processes in &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;2.5&#8197;V region that correspond to the radicals 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c and the anions (4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;c)&#8722;. Computational calculations suggest a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state for (4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;c)&#8722; with the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 17&#8211;24&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Robust Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Cancer with Enhanced Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (M@O&#8208;A) nanoparticles for synergetic cancer chemotherapy, PDT, and immune checkpoint blockade with reduced immunotoxicity are reported. M@O&#8208;A selectively targets and blocks the highly PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing tumor cells and decomposes under laser irradiation to release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxaliplatin (OXA), eliciting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and therefore an enhanced immunotherapy and simultaneously attenuated irAEs.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade has become a paradigm&#8208;shifting treatment modality to combat cancer, while conventional administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), often shows unsatisfactory immune responses and lead to severe immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs). Herein, we develop a PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which consists of oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle core and a dense shell of aptPD&#8208;L1 (denoted as M@O&#8208;A). Upon light irradiation, this nanosystem enables concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and enhanced immunotherapy in one shot to inhibit both primary colorectal tumors and untreated distant tumors in mice. Notably, M@O&#8208;A shows scarcely any systemic immunotoxicity in a clinical irAEs&#8208;mimic transgenic mouse model. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy for priming robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer with enhanced safety.

         <title>Cu/SaBox&#8208;Catalyzed Photoinduced Coupling of Acylsilanes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species has been achieved, by harnessing &#945;&#8208;siloxyl carbene intermediates that were in situ generated from acylsilanes. Mechanistic studies suggested that the side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands are crucial for this coupling reaction.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with Fischer metal carbene intermediates bearing an electron&#8208;rich alkoxyl or siloxyl group remains a big challenge due to the lack of readily available corresponding carbene precursors. Herein, we report the coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species bearing a &#945;&#8208;siloxyl group, which could be in situ generated from acylsilanes catalytically under photoirradiation and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands prove to be crucial for this coupling reaction, which provides the corresponding alkynyl alcohol in high yields with remarkable heterocycle tolerance and broad substrate scope.

         <title>Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary electronic insulation strategy is proposed to tolerate the electronic conductivity of sulfide electrodes at the grain boundaries, which realizes dendrite&#8208; and self&#8208;discharge&#8208;free and humidity&#8208;stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivities are one of the most highly sought for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivities of sulfide electrolytes (&#8776;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) lead to electron smooth transport through the sulfide electrolyte pellets, resulting in Li dendrite directly depositing at the grain boundaries (GBs) and serious self&#8208;discharge. Here, a grain&#8208;boundary electronic insulation (GBEI) strategy is proposed to block electron transport across the GBs, enabling Li&#8722;Li symmetric cells with 30&#8197;times longer cycling life and Li&#8722;LiCoO2 full cells with three times lower self&#8208;discharging rate than pristine sulfide electrolytes. The Li&#8722;LiCoO2 ASSLBs deliver high capacity retention of 80&#8201;% at 650&#8197;cycles and stable cycling performance for over 2600&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The innovation of the GBEI strategy provides a new direction to pursue high&#8208;performance ASSLBs via tailoring the electronic conductivity.

&#8220;Fungal tree&#8221;&#8208;like hetero&#8208;structured AgNWs@BNNS fillers and thermally conductive AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite films with integrated capabilities of superior Joule heating, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties for next&#8208;generation versatile applications of energy conversion, 5G electronic devices and artificial intelligence have been developed.







Abstract
Thermal conduction for electronic equipment has grown in importance in light of the burgeoning of 5G communication. It is imperatively desired to design highly thermally conductive fillers and polymer composite films with prominent Joule heating characteristics and extensive mechanical properties. In this work, &#8220;solvothermal &amp; in situ growth&#8221; method is carried out to prepare &#8220;Fungal tree&#8221;&#8208;like hetero&#8208;structured silver nanowires@boron nitride nanosheet (AgNWs@BNNS) thermally conductive fillers. The thermally conductive AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite films are obtained by the method of &#8220;suction filtration self&#8208;assembly and hot&#8208;pressing&#8221;. When the mass fraction of AgNWs@BNNS is 50&#8197;wt%, AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite film presents the optimal thermal conductivity coefficient of 9.44&#8197;W/(m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K) and excellent tensile strength of 136.6&#8197;MPa, good temperature&#8208;voltage response characteristics, superior electrical stability and reliability, which promise a wide application potential in 5G electronic devices.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C(13)/C(13&#8242;) bis&#8208;desmethyl analogue of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z has been prepared by cyclodimerization through double Stille cross&#8208;coupling as the key enabling step. C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z binds to tubulin in a very similar mode as the natural product and inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro with low nanomolar potency, thus retaining the potent growth inhibitory capacity of disorazole&#8197;Z.







Abstract
We describe the total synthesis of the macrodiolide C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z through double inter&#8208;/intramolecular Stille cross&#8208;coupling of a monomeric vinyl stannane/vinyl iodide precursor to form the macrocycle. The key step in the synthesis of this precursor was a stereoselective aldol reaction of a formal Evans acetate aldol product with crotonaldehyde. As demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the binding mode of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z to tubulin is virtually identical with that of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z. Likewise, C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z inhibits tubulin assembly with at least the same potency as disorazole&#8197;Z and it appears to be a more potent cell growth inhibitor.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Crystalline Anions Based on Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 5/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable anions based on classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) can be prepared by KC8 reduction of the corresponding NHC radicals as reported by Diego&#8197;M. Andrada, Rajendra&#8197;S. Ghadwal, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215244). The key to the stability of these anions is the delocalization of the electron lone pair over the C2&#8208;biphenyl substituent. In the solid state, the anions form a hexameric tubular structure with biphenyl substituents pointing inwards, as a result of intriguing cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. The spider weaves its web.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing, and catalysis. In their Communication (e202212459), Petra&#8197;S. Dittrich et&#8197;al. demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need for additional capping agents. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt; (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing, and catalysis. In their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202212459"&gt;e202212459&lt;/a&gt;), Petra&#8197;S. Dittrich et&#8197;al. demonstrate the stabilizer-free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter-sized reactors. AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need for additional capping agents. This method opens the way to fine-tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles.

Carbon&#8208;13 radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate, as reported by Thomas Theis, Eduard&#8197;Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202215678). Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a 1.4&#8197;T NMR spectrometer equipped with a standard radiofrequency detection coil for over three minutes. RASER detection enables new detection schemes for 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized contrast agents and particular new opportunities for next&#8208;generation molecular imaging on clinical MRI scanners.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Techniques in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a summary of recent developments in piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The application of the piezoelectric effect, classification of piezoelectric materials, and piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation are discussed. Urgent problems and prospects of piezocatalytic techniques are also presented.







Abstract
As a consequence of rapid industrialization throughout the world, various environmental pollutants have begun to accumulate in water, air, and soil. This endangers the ecological environment of the earth, and environmental remediation has become an immediate priority. Among various environmental remediation techniques, piezocatalytic techniques, which uniquely take advantage of the piezoelectric effect, have attracted much attention. Piezoelectric effects allow pollutant degradation directly, while also enhancing photocatalysis by reducing the recombination of photogenerated carriers. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent developments in piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The origin of the piezoelectric effect as well as classification of piezoelectric materials and their application in environmental remediation are systematically summarized. We also analyze the potential underlying mechanisms. Finally, urgent problems and the future development of piezocatalytic techniques are discussed.

         <title>Modelling Development in Radical (Co)Polymerization of Multivinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major developments of modelling approaches in radical polymerization of multivinyl monomers (MVM) are summarized and their applications on FRP and RDRP are highlighted. This Minireview hopes to show that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer scientists. It aims to serve as a concise introduction to push the boundary of using modelling techniques to understand the mechanism and product structure in MVM polymerization.







Abstract
Radical polymerization (RP) of multivinyl monomers (MVMs) provides a facile solution for manipulating polymer topology and has received increasing attention due to their industrial and academic significance. Continuous efforts have been made to understand their mechanism, which is the key to regulating materials structure. Modelling techniques have become a powerful tool that can provide detailed information on polymerization kinetics which is inaccessible by experiments. Many publications have reported the combination of experiments and modelling for free radical polymerization (FRP) and reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRP) of MVMs. Herein, a minireview is presented for the most important modelling techniques and their applications in FRP/RDRP of MVMs. This review hopes to illustrate that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer researchers and inspire new thinking for the future MVMs experiment optimization and product design.

         <title>Sustainable and Selective Modern Methods of Noble Metal Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently developed solvometallurgical methods with the emphasis on green reagents, solvents and strategies are discussed in recycling noble metals Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Ag and Au. Sustainable and separative techniques including selective dissolution, precipitation and coordination for processing of multi&#8208;metal substrates like end of life catalysts and WEEE are highlighted.







Abstract
Noble metals exhibit broad arrange of applications in industry and several aspects of human life which are becoming more and more prevalent in modern times. Due to their limited sources and constantly and consistently expanding demand, recycling of secondary and waste materials must accompany the traditional mineral extractions. This Minireview covers the most recent solvometallurgical developments in regeneration of Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Ag and Au with emphasis on sustainability and selectivity. Processing&#8212;by selective oxidative dissolution, reductive precipitation, solvent extraction, co&#8208;precipitation, membrane transfer and trapping to solid media&#8212;of eligible multi&#8208;metal substrates for recycling from waste printed circuit boards to end&#8208;of&#8208;life automotive catalysts are discussed. Outlook for possible future direction for noble metal recycling is proposed with emphasis on sustainable approaches.

This Minireview highlights the advancements in the area of micro&#8208; and nanomotors and discusses current methods and mechanisms to control their movement. We review motors&#8217; design, modes of propulsion and incorporation of different modes in one motor chassis so that control can be achieved.







Abstract
Unprecedented opportunities exist for the generation of advanced nanotechnologies based on synthetic micro/nanomotors (MNMs), such as active transport of medical agents or the removal of pollutants. In this regard, great efforts have been dedicated toward controlling MNM motion (e.g., speed, directionality). This was generally performed by precise engineering and optimizing of the motors&#8242; chassis, engine, powering mode (i.e., chemical or physical), and mechanism of motion. Recently, new insights have emerged to control motors mobility, mainly by the inclusion of different modes that drive propulsion. With high degree of synchronization, these modes work providing the required level of control. In this Minireview, we discuss the diverse factors that impact motion; these include MNM morphology, modes of mobility, and how control over motion was achieved. Moreover, we highlight the main limitations that need to be overcome so that such motion control can be translated into real applications.

         <title>Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Catalyzes Benzene Ring Formation in the Biosynthesis of Trialkyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small group of P450 enzymes were identified to form a benzene ring from an acyclic polyene substrate in the biosynthesis of lorneic acid and other trialkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of this unique P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation.







Abstract
Lorneic acid and related natural products are characterized by a trialkyl&#8208;substituted benzene ring. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of the polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and able to produce trialkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work expands our knowledge of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome&#8197;P450.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T&#8197;NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor of 32 without any modifications for over 3&#8197;minutes, paving the way to new frontiers for HP 13C contrast agents.







Abstract
The feasibility of Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency (RF) Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate was prepared via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to vinyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate and polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen&#8208;derived protons to the carbon&#8208;13 nucleus via magnetic field cycling yielding C&#8208;13 nuclear spin polarization of approximately 6&#8201;%. RASER signals were detected from samples with concentration ranging from 0.12 to 1&#8197;M concentration using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T&#8197;NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor (Q) of 32 without any modifications. C&#8208;13 RASER signals were observed for several minutes on a single bolus of hyperpolarized substrate to achieve 21&#8197;mHz NMR linewidths. The feasibility of creating long&#8208;lasting C&#8208;13 RASER on biomolecular carriers opens a wide range of new opportunities for the rapidly expanding field of C&#8208;13 magnetic resonance hyperpolarization.

         <title>A Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution Strategy for the Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Streptonigrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;standing challenge of preparing P&#8208;streptonigrin with high levels of enantioenrichment has been addressed by the use of an atroposelective dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. The strategy highlights the versatility of organoboron chemistry, as it plays a central role in ring synthesis, atropisomer resolution and functional group installation.







Abstract
We report that axially chiral biaryl boronic esters can be generated with control of atroposelectivity by a Binol&#8208;mediated dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. These intermediates can be progressed to enantioenriched products through stereoretentive functionalization of the carbon&#8211;boron bond. Finally, we have exploited this method in the first highly stereoselective total synthesis of P&#8208;streptonigrin.

         <title>Coordination of Polyketide Release and Multiple Detoxification Pathways for Tolerable Production of Fungal Mycotoxins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of aurovertins involves a coordinated strategy for the tolerable production of fungal mycotoxins. A cyclase promotes the release of the polyketide backbone, while enzymatic acetylation functions as the major detoxification pathway, and non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways function as salvage routes to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites.







Abstract
Efficient biosynthesis of microbial bioactive natural products (NPs) is beneficial for the survival of producers, while self&#8208;protection is necessary to avoid self&#8208;harm resulting from over&#8208;accumulation of NPs. The underlying mechanisms for the effective but tolerable production of bioactive NPs are not well understood. Herein, in the biosynthesis of two fungal polyketide mycotoxins aurovertin&#8197;E (1) and asteltoxin, we show that the cyclases in the gene clusters promote the release of the polyketide backbone, and reveal that a signal peptide is crucial for their subcellular localization and full activity. Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of 1. If intermediates are over&#8208;produced, the non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self&#8208;protection. These findings provided new insight into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.

A photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds has been developed. By this method, a series of &#947;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds were synthesized in high yields and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Carbene insertion reactions initiated with diazo compounds have been widely used to develop unnatural enzymatic reactions. However, alternative functionalization of diazo compounds in enzymatic processes has been unexploited. Herein, we describe a photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds. This method generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals through an ene reductase catalyzed photoinduced electron transfer process from diazo compounds, enabling the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbonyl compounds in good yields and stereoselectivities. This study further expands the possible reaction patterns in photo&#8208;biocatalysis and offers a new approach to solving the selectivity challenges of radical&#8208;mediated reactions.

Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene or cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. The reaction initially provides the simple hydroarylated diborene, but in some cases proceeds further, providing unusual 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine and base&#8208;stabilized alkylidene products.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. A simple pyridyldiborene is formed when an NHC&#8208;stabilized diboryne is combined with pyridine, while a CAAC&#8208;stabilized diboryne leads to activation of two pyridine molecules to give a tricyclic alkylideneborane, which can be forced to undergo a further H&#8208;shift resulting in a zwitterionic, doubly benzo&#8208;fused 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine by heating. Use of the extended N&#8208;heteroaromatic quinoline leads to a borylmethyleneborane under mild conditions via an unprecedented boron&#8208;carbon exchange process.

         <title>Regulating the Mechanical and Optical Properties of Polymer&#8208;based Nanocomposites by Sub&#8208;Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simple mixing of hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and polyimide (PI), hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels displayed high viscosity and modulus. HSP films showed high transparency, regulable haze, and enhanced Young's modulus.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanowires (SNWs) exhibit great potential applications in nanocomposites owing to their high specific surface area, high flexibility, and similarity to polymer chains in dimension, which are a good entry point to bridge inorganic materials and polymer materials. Herein, we synthesized hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and engineered hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels and films by simple mixing of HAP SNWs and polyimide (PI). Benefiting from the interactions between HAP SNWs and PI, these nanocomposites were a continuous hybrid network. As the increase of HAP SNWs contents, the viscosity and modulus of HSP gels were greatly improved by one or two orders of magnitude compared with PI gel. HSP films not only maintained high transparency but also gained high haze, as well as exhibited enhanced Young's modulus. Thus, both HSP gels and films developed in this work are promising for various applications in coatings and high&#8208;performance films.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drugs via Alkene Formal Insertion into Benzylic C&#8722;F Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a new strategy of alkene&#8208;selective formal insertion into a benzylic C&#8722;F bond, which enables late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules. This transformation breaks a strong C&#8722;F bond and forms a somewhat weaker C&#8722;F bond at the same time, under mild conditions, thus providing an opportunity for straightforward access to partially fluorinated organic molecules via difunctionalization of alkenes.







Abstract
C&#8722;F insertion of carbon&#8208;atom units is underdeveloped although it poses significant potential applications in both drug discovery and development. Herein, we report a photocatalytic protocol for late&#8208;stage modification of trifluoromethyl aromatic drugs involving formal insertion of abundant alkene feedstocks into a benzylic C&#8722;F bond selectively. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation features mild conditions and extraordinary functional group tolerance. Preliminary studies are consistent with this transformation involving a radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway. Additionally, it offers an alternative strategy for difunctionalization of alkenes via quenching of the carbocation intermediate with nucleophiles other than external fluoride.

         <title>Isomeric Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Different Orientation of Imine Bonds and Distinct Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different orientations of their imine bonds were prepared by the introduction of oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties through a Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. The effects of the different orientation of imine bonds on the photoelectric properties of the COFs were evaluated through photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively studied in photocatalysis because of their easy synthesis and excellent crystallinity. The effect of imine&#8208;bond orientation on the photocatalytic properties of COFs, however, is still rarely studied. Herein, we report two novel COFs with different orientations of imine bonds using oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties. The COFs showed similar structures but great differences in their photoelectric properties. COF&#8208;932 demonstrated a superior hydrogen evolution performance compared to COF&#8208;923 when triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial agent. Interestingly, the use of ascorbic acid led to the protonation of the COFs, further altering the direction of electron transfer. The photocatalytic performances were increased to 23.4 and 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for protonated COF&#8208;923 and COF&#8208;932, respectively. This study provides a clear strategy for the design of imine&#8208;linked COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and advances the development of COFs.

         <dc:description>
A new type of cellulose aerogels with anisotropic and hierarchical porous architecture are developed via a petrochemical&#8208;free method. The aerogels display temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 105 compressive cycles at 50&#8201;% strain), large&#8208;strain recoverability (folding and twisting), angular recovery speed high up to 1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and exceptional fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Cellulose aerogels are plagued by intermolecular hydrogen bond&#8208;induced structural plasticity, otherwise rely on chemicals modification to extend service life. Here, we demonstrate a petrochemical&#8208;free strategy to fabricate superelastic cellulose aerogels by designing hierarchical structures at multi scales. Oriented channels consolidate the whole architecture. Porous walls of dehydrated cellulose derived from thermal etching not only exhibit decreased rigidity and stickiness, but also guide the microscopic deformation and mitigate localized large strain, preventing structural collapse. The aerogels show exceptional stability, including temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity, fatigue resistance (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 105&#8197;cycles), high angular recovery speed (1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&#8722;1), outperforming most cellulose&#8208;based aerogels. This benign strategy retains the biosafety of biomass and provides an alternative filter material for health&#8208;related applications, such as face masks and air purification.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched 2nd Order Non&#8208;Linear Optical Response in an Arylimido&#8208;Polyoxometalate with High Contrast and Cyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer transitions in a new arylimido&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) are turned off by reduction, enabling a high contrast (94&#8201;%) electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) response. The overall combination of on/off contrast, high visible transparency and multicycle stability is leading in switchable 2nd order NLO chromophores, and shows for the first time the strong potential of POM hybrids as redox&#8208;driven optical switches.







Abstract
Electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical responses have been demonstrated for the first time in polyoxometalates (POMs), with an arylimido&#8208;derivative showing a leading combination of high on/off contrast (94&#8201;%), high visible transparency, and cyclability. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical and TD&#8208;DFT studies indicate that the switch&#8208;off results from weakened charge transfer (CT) character of the electronic transitions in the reduced state. This represents the first study of an imido&#8208;POM reduced state, and demonstrates the potential of POM hybrids as electrochemically activated molecular switches.

         <title>Approaching Dianionic Tetraoxadiborecine Macrocycles: 10&#8208;Membered Bora&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating Borafluorenate Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dianionic tetraoxadiborecines are isolated via the reaction between 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion and non&#8208;benzenoid quinones. Remarkably, the bora&#8208;crown ether ring is able to capture a sodium ion from sodium tetrakis[3.5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate. Additionally, the position and/or binding of the metal ions to the bora&#8208;crown are easily observable via specific color changes.







Abstract
The addition of non&#8208;benzenoid quinones, acenapthenequinone or aceanthrenequinone, to the 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion (1) affords the first examples of dianionic 10&#8208;membered bora&#8208;crown ethers (2&#8211;5), which are characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 11B), X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These tetraoxadiborecines have distinct absorption profiles based on the positioning of the alkali metal cations. When compound 4, which has a vacant C4B2O4 cavity, is reacted with sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, a color change from purple to orange serves as a visual indicator of metal binding to the central ring, whereby the Na+ ion coordinates to four oxygen atoms. A detailed theoretical analysis of the calculated reaction energetics is provided to gain insight into the reaction mechanism for the formation of 2&#8211;5. These data, and the electronic structures of proposed intermediates, indicate that the reaction proceeds via a boron enolate intermediate.

         <title>Unveiling the High&#8208;valence Oxygen Degradation Across the Delithiated Cathode Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining synchrotron&#8208;based mRAS and APXPS, an integrated high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation scenario is established at the cathode surface. Compared with mRIXS, mRAS verified oxygen valence decrease from bulk to surface. APXPS further proves the CEI layer oxidized and deteriorated by O2. The high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation involving valence, chemical, and mechanical change can be general surface fading behavior in ARR active cathodes.







Abstract
Charge compensation on anionic redox reaction (ARR) has been promising to realize extra capacity beyond transition metal redox in battery cathodes. The practical development of ARR capacity has been hindered by high&#8208;valence oxygen instability, particularly at cathode surfaces. However, the direct probe of surface oxygen behavior has been challenging. Here, the electronic states of surface oxygen are investigated by combining mapping of resonant Auger electronic spectroscopy (mRAS) and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) on a model LiCoO2 cathode. The mRAS verified that no high&#8208;valence oxygen can sustain at cathode surfaces, while APXPS proves that cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer evolves and oxidizes upon oxygen gas contact. This work provides valuable insights into the high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation mode across the interface. Oxygen stabilization from surface architecture is proven a prerequisite to the practical development of ARR active cathodes.

         <title>Continuous Electroformation of Gold Nanoparticles in Nanoliter Droplet Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are generated on a microfluidic device. The droplets are then guided through a pair of parallel electrodes, where they are exposed to an electrical current, and gold nanoparticles are created.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are formed on a microfluidic device and exposed to an electrical current by guiding them through a pair of electrodes. We exploit the naturally occurring recirculation flows inside confined droplets (moving in rectangular microchannels) to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles after nucleation. Therefore, AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. The average particle size is defined by the precursor concentration and droplet velocity, while the charge dose given by the electric field strength has a minor effect. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles, and we believe it is a versatile method for the formation of other metal nanoparticles.

         <title>C&#8722;H Fluoromethoxylation of Arenes by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of [N&#8722;OCH2F] redox&#8208;active reagents were synthetized via electrodecarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O coupling of N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles with fluoroacetic acid and subsequent alkylation. By irradiation with blue LEDs in the presence of a photosensitizer, these bench stable reagents allow the synthesis of monofluoromethyl aryl ethers via functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active N&#8208;(fluoromethoxy)benzotriazoles were made accessible from fluoroacetic acid and hydroxybenzotriazoles via electrodecarboxylative coupling. After alkylation, they become effective monofluoromethoxylation reagents, enabling the photocatalytic C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes. Thus, irradiation of 1&#8208;(OCH2F)&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;6&#8208;(CF3)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers. This method allows the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant structures without relying on ecologically problematic halofluorocarbons.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Syngas Production: A Fe2O3 Photoanode Featuring Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Integrated with a Silver&#8208;Palladium Cathode</title>

Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 using a Ag/Pd cathode, integrated with a Fe2O3 photoanode decorated with single&#8208;atom cobalt, achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion efficiency of 2.69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical syngas production from aqueous CO2 is a promising technique for carbon capture and utilization. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and tunable syngas production by integrating a single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;catalyst&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with a bimetallic Ag/Pd alloy cathode. A record syngas production activity of 81.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (CO/H2 ratio: &#8776;1&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved under artificial sunlight (AM 1.5 G) with an excellent durability. Systematic studies reveal that the Co single atoms effectively extract the holes from Fe2O3 photoanodes and serve as active sites for promoting oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the Pd and Ag atoms in bimetallic cathodes selectively adsorb CO2 and protons for facilitating CO production. Further incorporation with a photovoltaic, to allow solar light (&gt;600&#8197;nm) to be utilized, yields a bias&#8208;free CO2 reduction device with solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO and solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion efficiencies up to 1.33 and 1.36 %, respectively.

         <title>Intramolecular Interception of the Remote Position of Vinylcarbene Silver Complex Intermediates by C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vinylogous position of a donor&#8208;donor silver vinyl carbene is trapped with an aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond for the first time to afford 1&#8208;benzoazepine scaffolds. The overall transformation entails a carbene alkyne metathesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene to furnish the key donor&#8208;donor silver vinyl carbene whose vinylogous position is selectively intercepted in a stepwise C&#8722;H bond insertion.







Abstract
The trapping of the elusive vinylogous position of a vinyl carbene with an aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been achieved for the first time during a silver&#8208;catalyzed carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM) process. A Tpx&#8208;containing silver complex first promotes the generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene which triggers CAM, generating a subsequent donor&#8208;donor vinyl silver carbene species, which then undergoes a selective vinylogous C(sp3)&#8722;H bond insertion, leading to the synthesis of a new family of benzoazepines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the reaction mechanism, which allows proposing that the C&#8722;H bond insertion reaction takes place in a stepwise manner, with the hydrogen shift being the rate determining step.

         <title>Azaarenes: 13 Rings in a Row by Cyclopentannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large, stable cyclopentannulated azaarenes, consisting of up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row, were prepared. Cyclopentannulation complements benzannulation strategies for the preparation of the higher (aza)arenes.







Abstract
Cyclopentannulation was explored as a strategy to access large, stable azaarenes. Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling of previously reported di&#8208; and tetrabrominated cyclopentannulated N,N&#8242;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacenes furnished stable azaarenes with up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row and a length of 3.1&#8197;nm. Their optoelectronic and semi&#8208;conducting properties as well as their aromaticity were investigated.

         <title>In Situ Reprogramming of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages with Internally and Externally Engineered Exosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reprogramming of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as an efficient strategy for immunotherapy. However, most of the approaches did not allow the in situ reprogramming of TAM because their low efficiency, non&#8208;specificity, or potential side effects. Herein, we produced exosomes with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) internally engineered and the TAM specific peptide externally engineered onto the exosome membrane. The  internally and  externally  engineered  exosomes (IEEE, also named as I3E) allowed the selective homing to tumor tissue and targeted to M2&#8208;like TAMs, which nearly repressed the expression of PI&#8208;3 kinase gamma (PI3K&#947;) completely, and induced the TAMs polarizing to M1 both in vitro and in vivo. The polarized M1 macrophages awakened the &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor&#8208;immunity, causing the increase of T lymphocyte infiltration and the decrease of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and inhibiting the tumor growth significantly. I3E reprogramed TAMs in situ precisely and efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Substantial Improvement of an Epimerase for the Synthesis of D&#8208;Allulose by&#160;Biosensor&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Microdroplet Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosynthesis of D&#8208;allulose has been achieved using ketose 3&#8208;epimerases (KEases), but its application is limited by poor catalytic performance. Here, we redesigned a genetically encoded biosensor based on a D&#8208;allulose&#8208;responsive transcriptional regulator for real&#8208;time monitoring of D&#8208;allulose. An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput droplet&#8208;based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D&#8208;allulose&#8208;detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of Sinorhizobium fredii D&#8208;allulose 3&#8208;epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3&#8208;2 was identified with 17&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Electrooxidative Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8211;H Annulation with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the merging of electrosynthesis with 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation has emerged as a sustainable and powerful technique in organic synthesis. Despite the impressive advantages, the development of an enantioselective version remains elusive and pose a daunting challenge. Herein, we reported the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins in a simple undivided cell at room temperature&#160;(up to 99% ee).  t Bu&#8208;Salox, a rationally designed Salox ligand bearing a bulky tert&#8208;butyl group at the ortho&#8208;position of phenol based on the mechanistic understanding, was found to be crucial for this asymmetric annulation reaction. A strong cooperative effect of  t Bu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8208;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins without secondary bond interaction (up to 96% ee and 97:3 rr). Cyclovoltametric studies, the preparation, characterization, and transformation of cobaltacycle intermediates shed light on the mechanism of this reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are promising and safe energy storage devices for mobile electronics and electric vehicles. In this work, we report a facile in situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane electrolytes to fabricate integrated solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The in situ polymerization and formation of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active materials is the key to realizing a high&#8208;performance battery with excellent interfacial contact among CNTs, active materials and electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes could be tightly integrated into batteries through the CNTs and electrolyte. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Electrodes with a low resistance of 4.5 &#937; &#9633;&#8208;1 and high lithium&#8208;ion diffusion efficiency of 2.5&#215;10&#8208;11 cm2 s&#8208;1 can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Bi Nanosheets Promotes CO2&#8226;&#8722; Formation for High&#8208;Performance and pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to chemical fuels such as formate offers a promising pathway to carbon&#8208;neutral future, but its practical application is largely inhibited by the lack of effective activation of CO2 molecules and pH&#8208;universal feasibility. Here, we report an electronic structure manipulation strategy to electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets, where electrons transfer from Cu donor to Bi acceptor in bimetallic Cu&#8208;Bi, enabling CO2RR towards formate with concurrent high activity, selectivity and stability in pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral and alkaline) electrolytes. Combined in situ Raman spectra and computational calculations unravel that electron&#8208;rich Bi promote CO2&#8226;&#8722; formation to activate CO2 molecules, and enhance the adsorption strength of *OCHO intermediate with an up&#8208;shifted p&#8208;band center, thus leading to its superior activity and selectivity of formate. Further integration of the robust electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets into III&#8208;V&#8208;based photovoltaic solar cell results in an unassisted artificial leaf with a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate (STF) efficiency of 13.7%.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide materials by using molecular cages serving as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. Reaction of the [2,2,2] cryptand (DHS) linker with Pb(II) in acidic media gave rise to the first porous and water stable 2D metal halide semiconductor (DHS)2Pb5Br14. The corresponding material is stable in liquid water for a year, while gas and vapor sorption studies revealed that it can selectively and reversibly adsorb H2O and D2O at room temperature (RT). Solid state NMR measurements and DFT calculations verified the incorporation of H2O and D2O in the organic linker cavities, and shed light on their molecular configuration. In addition to porosity, the material exhibits broad light emission centered at 617 nm with a full width at half&#8208;maximum (fwhm) of 284 nm (0.96 eV). The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens up new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid&#8208;state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuned Multicolor Emission of 2D Lead Halide Perovskites with Ultrahigh Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical diversity and structural flexibility of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) offer tremendous opportunities to tune their optical properties through internal molecular engineering and external stimuli. Herein, we report the wide&#8208;range and ultrapure photoluminescence emissions in a family of homologous 2D LHPs, [MeOPEA]2PbBr4&#8722;4xI4x (MeOPEA = 4&#8208;methoxyphenethylammonium; x = 0, 0.2, 0.425, 0.575, 1) enabled through internal chemical pressure and external hydrostatic pressure. The chemical pressure, induced by the C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and halogen doping/substitution strengthens the structural rigidity to give sustained narrow emissions, and regulates the emission energy, respectively. Further manipulation of physical pressure leads to wide&#8208;range emission tuning from 412 to 647 nm in a continuous and reversible manner. This work could open up new pathways for developing 2D LHP emitters with ultra&#8208;wide color gamut and high color purity which are highly useful for pressure sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Additive&#8208;derived Films on Cu Electrodes Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products Under Strongly Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) at low pH is desired for high CO2 utilization; the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge. High alkali cation concentration at a high operating current density has recently been used to promote electrochemical CO2R at low pH. Herein we report an alternative approach to selective CO2R (&gt;70% Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products, FEC2+) at low pH (pH = 2; H3PO4/KH2PO4) and low potassium concentration ([K+] = 0.1 M) using organic film&#8208;modified polycrystalline copper (Modified&#8208;Cu). Such an electrode effectively mitigates HER due to attenuated proton transport. Modified&#8208;Cu still achieves high FEC2+ (45% with Cu foil /55% with Cu GDE) even under 1.0 M H3PO4 (pH ~ 1) at low [K+] (0.1 M) even at low operating current, conditions where HER can otherwise dominate.</dc:description>

         <title>Concerted and Selective Electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived Alcohol to Glycolic Acid at an Industry&#8208;level Current Density over a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electro&#8208;reforming of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into fine chemicals and H2 is an ideal solution to address severe plastic pollution. Here we report the electrooxidation of EG to glycolic acid (GA) with a high Faraday efficiency and selectivity (&gt; 85%) even at an industry&#8208;level current density (600 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.15 V vs. RHE) over a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200 h can be achieved, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that 1) the OH* generation promoted by Ni(OH)2 plays a critical role in facilitating EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA oxidation and removing poisonous carbonyl species, thereby achieving high activity and stability; 2) Pd with a downshifted d&#8208;band center and the oxophilic Ni can synergistically facilitate the rapid desorption and transfer of GA from the active Pd sites to the inactive Ni sites, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and thus achieving high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly&#8208;Hydride [Au(I)7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 cluster complex: Structure, Transformation, and CO2 Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Hydride Au(I) bonds are labile due to the mismatch in electric potential of an oxidizing metal and reducing ligand, and therefore the structure and structure&#8208;activity relationships of nanoclusters that contain them are seldom studied. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of [Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (abbrev. Au7H52+), an Au cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, which decomposed to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (abbrev. Au82+) upon exposure to light (300 to 450 nm). The valence state of Au(I) and H&#8208; was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and XPS. The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5%). Further DFT calculations showed that the H&#8208; ligand inhibited the CO2RR process compared with the electron&#8208;donor H.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Experimentally Determined CO Adsorption Enthalpy with Electrochemical CO Reduction Performance on Cu Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO binding energy has been widely employed as a descriptor for effective catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR), however, it has yet to be determined experimentally at electrochemical interfaces due to the lack of suitable techniques. In this work, we developed a method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces with quantitative surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. On dendritic Cu at &#8208;0.75 V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5 &#177; 0.5 kJ/mol, ~37.9 &#177; 13.4 J/(mol&#215;K), and ~&#8208;9.8 &#177; 4.0 kJ/mol, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide&#8208;derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO(2)RR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>One Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have been well employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversities. However, the atomic utilization efficiency was still under improved, because of the catalytic centers located in the basal layers, which is difficult to access the electrolytes. Herein, we have first demonstrated 1D COFs for 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With using different four&#8208;connectivity blocks, the prepared 1D COFs display good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites made the 1D COFs showed higher electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8&#8208;fold of that of controlled 2D COF, and thus enable to catalyze ORR with higher H2O2 selectivity of 85.8% and activity with TOF value of 0.051 s&#8208;1 at 0.2 V, than those of 2D COF (72.9% and 0.032 s&#8208;1). This work paves the way to developing COFs with low dimension for electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Au(310)@Cu High&#8208;index Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical selectivity and faradaic efficiency of high&#8208;index Cu facets for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is investigated. More specifically, shape&#8208;controlled nanoparticles enclosed by Cu {hk0} facets are fabricated using Cu multilayer deposition at three distinct layer thicknesses on the surface facets of Au truncated ditetragonal nanoprisms (Au DTPs). Au DTPs are shapes enclosed by 12 high&#8208;index {310} facets. Facet angle analysis confirms DTP geometry. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. The 7 nm Au@Cu DTPs high&#8208;index {hk0} facets exhibit a CH4:CO product ratio of almost 10:1 compared to a 1:1 ratio for the reference 7 nm Au@Cu spherical nanoparticles (NPs). Operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra disclose reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate, whereas CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Biased Borate Esterification during Nucleoside Phosphorylase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Apparent Equilibrium Shifts and Kinetic Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic nucleoside (trans&#8208;)glycosylations catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylases have graduated to a practical and convenient approach to the preparation of modified nucleosides, which are important pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various cancers and viral infections. However, the obtained yields in these reactions are generally determined exclusively by the innate thermodynamic properties of the nucleosides involved, hampering the biocatalytic access to many sought&#8208;after target nucleosides. We herein report an additional means for reaction engineering of these systems. We show how apparent equilibrium shifts in phosphorolysis and glycosylation reactions can be effected through entropically driven, biased esterification of nucleosides and ribosyl phosphates with inorganic borate. Our multifaceted analysis further describes the kinetic implications of this in situ reactant esterification for a model phosphorylase.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simple unhindered aldimines tend to hydrolyze or oligomerize and are therefore spectroscopically not well characterized.&#160; Herein we report the formation and spectroscopic characterization of the simplest imino acid, namely glycine imine, by cryogenic matrix isolation IR and UV/Vis spectroscopy.&#160; Glycine imine forms after UV irradiation of 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid by N2 extrusion in anti&#8208;(E,E)&#8208; and anti&#8208;(Z,Z) conformation that can be photochemically interconverted.&#160; In matrix isolation pyrolysis experiments with 2&#8208;azidoacetic acid glycine imine cannot be trapped as it further decarboxylates to aminomethylene.&#160; In aqueous solution glycine imine is hydrolyzed to hydroxy glycine and hydrated glyoxylic acid.&#160; At higher concentrations or in the presence of Fe(II)SO4 as a reducing agent glycine imine undergoes self&#8208;reduction by oxidative decarboxylation chemistry.&#160; Glycine imine may be seen as one of the key reaction intermediates connecting prebiotic amino acid and sugar formation chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Reactions of the Cyaphide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyaphide anion, CP&#8722;, is shown to undergo three distinct oligomerization reactions in the coordination sphere of metals. Reductive coupling of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) by Sm(Cp*)2(OEt2) (Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), was found to afford a tetra&#8208;metallic complex containing a 2,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;butadiene&#8208;1,1,4,4&#8208;tetraide fragment. By contrast, non&#8208;reductive dimerization of Ni(SIDipp)(Cp)(CP) (SIDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazoleidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; Cp = cyclopentadienyl), gives rise to an asymmetric bimetallic complex containing a 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobuta&#8208;diene&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide moiety. Spontaneous trimerization of Sc(Cp*)2(CP) results in the formation of a trimetallic complex&#160;&#160;containing a 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triide fragment. These transformations show that while cyaphido transition metal complexes can be readily accessed using metathesis reactions, many such species are unstable to further oligomerization processes.</dc:description>
