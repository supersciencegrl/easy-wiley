         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8211;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst.    The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8 for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250 &#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250 &#176;C, 50 bar): 7.46 molmethanol molmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &gt;99%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Overall Splitting of Pure Water in a Porous Microreactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic overall splitting of pure water (H2O) without sacrificial reagent to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) holds a great potential for achieving carbon neutrality. Herein, by anchoring cobalt sulfide (Co9S8) as cocatalyst and cadmium sulfide (CdS) as light absorber to channel wall of a porous polymer microreactor (PP12), continuous violent H2 and O2 bubbling productions from photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent is achieved, with H2 and O2 production rates as high as 4.41 and 2.20 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1 respectively. These are significantly enhanced than those in the widely used stirred tank&#8208;type reactor in which no O2 is produced and H2 production rate is only 0.004 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1. Besides improved charge separation and interaction of H2O with photocatalyst in PP12, bonding interaction of Co9S8 with PP12 creates abundant catalytic active sites for simultaneous productions of H2 and O2, thus leading to the significantly enhanced H2 and O2 bubbling productions in PP12. This offers a new strategy to enhance photocatalytic overall splitting of pure H2O without sacrificial reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Homopropargylic Alcohols via Cycloisomerization: Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopentenes Featuring a Quaternary Chiral Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentene rings possessing a chiral quaternary center are important structural motifs found in various natural products. In this work, we disclose expedient and efficient access to this class of synthetically valuable structures via highly enantioselective desymmetrization of prochiral propargylic alcohols. The efficient chirality induction in this asymmetric gold catalysis is achieved via two&#8208;point bindings between a gold catalyst featuring a bifunctional phosphine ligand and the substrate homopropargylic alcohol moiety &#8211; an H&#8208;bonding interaction between the HO group and a ligand phosphine oxide moiety and the gold&#8208;alkyne complexation. The propargylic alcohol substrates can be prepared readily via propargylation of ketone precursors, and spirocyclic and bicyclic cyclopentenes are formed with additional neighboring chiral centers of flexible stereochemistry in addition to the quaternary center. This work represents rare gold&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective cycloisomerization of 1,5&#8208;enynes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the chirality induction model and suggest that the rate acceleration enabled by the bifunctional ligand can be attributed to a facilitated protodeauration step at the end of the catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Responsive Crystalline B&#8592;N Host Adducts with Solvent&#8208;Induced Allosteric Effect for Guest Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;responsive organic crystals, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy to initiate conformational transitions, present an emerging strategy for developing lightweight and versatile smart materials. However, visible light&#8208;triggered tailored guests capture and release behaviors in all&#8208;organic solids are rarely reported. Here, we introduce a photoreactive crystalline boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) host adduct with the ability to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition upon 447 nm light exposure. This process facilitates single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) photodimerization in the mother liquor, maintaining the original B&#8592;N host structure. Weakened intermolecular interactions within the photodimer host contribute to fast guest release in air under irradiation. Furthermore, the dynamic B&#8592;N bonds enable reversible transformations between organic host adducts and adduct cocrystals under the solvent&#8208;induced allosteric effect. As a result, four B&#8592;N host adduct crystals containing individual alkane guest are easily obtained and exhibited the ability of photo&#8208;controlled alkane release. Therefore, the integration of photo reactivity and structural transformation within B&#8592;N host adduct enables customized capture and release of guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Solid&#8208;Solution Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Porous Molecular Crystals for In&#8208;situ Generation of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional synthetic methods of organic luminescent molecules often involve labor&#8208;intensive solution&#8208;phase organic synthesis, which violate the principles of atom&#8208;economic transformation. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) offers a promising alternative, allowing direct transformation from one fluorophore to another. Although PSM is commonly implemented in extended frameworks, its application in porous molecular crystals remains challenging. Herein, we focus on utilizing porous molecular crystals, specifically tetraphenylethylene&#8208;cored frameworks, as versatile platforms for tandem PSM reactions to customize organic fluorophores. The tailored skeleton design ensures both the formation of porous structures and the occurrence of tandem solid&#8208;solution reactions while maintaining the solid state of reactants and products in each step. The inherent non&#8208;covalent bonding nature of the frameworks facilitates processing and characterization, offering unparalleled advantages for porous networks. The accompanying solid&#8208;state fluorescence transition from green to blue and then to green (or yellow) enables real&#8208;time monitoring of tandem reactions and provides intuitive mechanistic insights. This phenomenon is exploited for the facile construction of a dynamic information encryption system using fluorescent quick response codes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in&#8208;situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8208;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in&#8208;situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8208;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8208;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in&#8208;situ formed Fe&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4 mV at current density of 18.0 mA cm&#8208;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8208;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>A General Descriptor for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Axial Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general descriptor &#963; was constructed to predict the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activity of axial coordination ligand single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACL&#8208;SACs). We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8722;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Importantly, an axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL was also identified that can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment.







Abstract
Decoration of an axial coordination ligand (ACL) on the active metal site is a highly effective and versatile strategy to tune activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the regulation mechanism of ACLs on SACs is still incompletely known. Herein, we investigate diversified combinations of ACL&#8208;SACs, including all 3d&#8211;5d transition metals and ten prototype ACLs. We identify that ACLs can weaken the adsorption capability of the metal atom (M) by raising the bonding energy levels of the M&#8722;O bond while enhancing dispersity of the d orbital of M. Through examination of various local configurations and intrinsic parameters of ACL&#8208;SACs, a general structure descriptor &#963; is constructed to quantify the structure&#8211;activity relationship of ACL&#8208;SACs which solely based on a few key intrinsic features. Importantly, we also identified the axial ligand descriptor &#963;ACL, as a part of &#963;, which can serve as a potential descriptor to determine the rate&#8208;limiting steps (RLS) of ACL&#8208;SACs in experiment. And we predicted several ACL&#8208;SACs, namely, CrN4&#8208;, FeN4&#8208;, CoN4&#8208;, RuN4&#8208;, RhN4&#8208;, OsN4&#8208;, IrN4&#8208; and PtN4&#8208;ACLs, that entail markedly higher activities than the benchmark catalysts of Pt and IrO2 for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, thereby supporting that the general descriptor &#963; can provide a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to assess efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cationic Bis(hydrosilane)&#8212;Coinage&#8208;Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Characterization, and Use as Catalysts for Outer&#8208;Sphere C=O Hydrosilylation Not Involving Metal Hydrides</title>

Coinage&#8208;metal hydrides or Lewis acidic cationic hydrosilane&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes? The synthesis and characterization of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes are reported. These can catalyze carbonyl hydrosilylation without the addition of an external base. Mechanistic control experiments and DFT calculations reveal a new mechanism in which the coinage&#8208;metal&#8211;alkoxides act as the key intermediates.







Abstract
The preparation of cationic bis(hydrosilane)&#8211;coinage&#8208;metal complexes by chloride abstraction from the neutral metal chloride precursors with Na[BArF4] is described. Unlike previously reported hydrosilane&#8208;stabilized copper and silver complexes, the presented complexes are cationic and feature two bidentate (ortho&#8208;silylphenyl)phosphine ligands. These complexes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, revealing that both Si&#8722;H bonds are activated by the Lewis acidic cationic metal center. The new complexes were found to be effective in catalytic carbonyl hydrosilylation, leading to the corresponding silyl ethers under mild conditions without the addition of an external base. Combined mechanistic control experiments and quantum chemical calculations support an ionic outer&#8208;sphere mechanism, in which a neutral metal alkoxide species instead of a metal hydride is the key intermediate that interacts with the silylcarboxonium ion to generate the silyl ether.

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of 2D and 3D bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying dimensions, topologies, and linkages were employed to systematically investigate their piezochromic behavior, revealing significant pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement with an increase of 16&#8208;fold, as well as rare instances of blue&#8208;shifted emission.







Abstract
Achieving enhanced or blue&#8208;shifted emission from piezochromic materials remains a major challenge. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for the development of piezochromic materials owing to their dynamic structures and adjustable optical properties, where the emission behaviors are not solely determined by the functional groups, but are also greatly influenced by the specific geometric arrangement. Nevertheless, this area remains relatively understudied. In this study, a successful synthesis of a series of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying topologies, dimensions, and linkages was conducted, followed by an investigation of their structural and emission properties under hydrostatic pressure generated by a diamond anvil cell. Consequently, these COFs exhibited distinct piezochromic behaviors, particularly a remarkable pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE) phenomenon with a 16&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity from three&#8208;dimensional COFs, surpassing the performance of CPMs and most organic small molecules with PIEE behavior. On the contrary, three two&#8208;dimensional COFs with flexible structures exhibited rare blue&#8208;shifted emission, whereas the variants with rigid and conjugated structures showed common red&#8208;shifted and reduced emission. Mechanism research further revealed that these different piezochromic behaviors were primarily determined by interlayer distance and interaction. This study represents the first systematic exploration of the structures and emission properties of COFs through pressure&#8208;treated engineering and provides a new perspective on the design of piezochromic materials.

Combining with the surface sensitive heterodyne mode and volume sensitive homodyne mode of infrared photo induced force microscopy, the 3&#8208;dimensional organic ion migration behaviors in organic metal halide perovskite has been imaged with sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm resolution, revealing the bias&#8208;dependent transition of MA+ migration channels from grain boundaries to grains and allowing the calculation of MA+ drift velocity across GBs.







Abstract
The performance and stability of organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) optoelectronic devices have been associated with ion migration. Understanding of nanoscale resolved organic cation migration mechanism would facilitate structure engineering and commercialization of OMHP. Here, we report a three&#8208;dimensional approach for in situ nanoscale infrared imaging of organic ion migration behavior in OMHPs, enabling to distinguish migrations along grain boundary and in crystal lattice. Our results reveal that organic cation migration along OMHP film surface and grain boundaries (GBs) occurs at lower biases than in crystal lattice. We visualize the transition of organic cation migration channels from GBs to volume upon increasing electric field. The temporal resolved results demonstrate the fast MA+ migration kinetics at GBs, which is comparable to diffusivity of halide ions. Our findings help understand the role of organic cations in the performance of OMHP devices, and the proposed approach holds broad applicability for revealing migration mechanisms of organic ions in OMHPs based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Interface Engineering via Manipulating Solvation Chemistry for Liquid Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH) = &#916;G(*OH) + 3.2 &#177; 0.2 eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8208;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenophene&#8208;fused Perylene Diimide&#8208;Based Cathode Interlayer Enables 19&#8201;% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells via Stimulative Charge Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.







Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

         <title>A Dual Cobalt&#8208;Photoredox Catalytic Approach for Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles with Aryl Amides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we showcase cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric dearomatization of indoles with aryl amides, achieving remarkable enantioinduction and exceptional regioselectivity. This dual catalytic strategy, which integrates photocatalyst and cobalt, represents a pioneering approach in asymmetric C&#8722;H bond functionalization. Through detailed experimental investigations and DFT calculations, we present a plausible mechanism to elucidate the reaction pathway.







Abstract
In this study, we unveil a novel method for the asymmetric dearomatization of indoles under cobalt/photoredox catalysis. By strategically activating C&#8722;H bonds of amides and subsequent migratory insertion of &#960;&#8208;bonds present in indole as reactive partner, we achieve syn&#8208;selective tetrahydro&#8208;5H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;c]isoquinolin&#8208;5&#8208;one derivatives with excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. The developed method operates without a metal oxidant, relying solely on oxygen as the oxidant and employing an organic dye as a photocatalyst under irradiation. Control experiments and stoichiometric studies elucidate the reversible nature of the enantiodetermining C&#8722;H activation step, albeit not being rate&#8208;determining. This study not only expands the horizon of cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond functionalization, but also showcases the potential synergy between cobalt and photoredox catalysis in enabling asymmetric synthesis of complex molecules.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Frameworks with Controlled and Uniform Pore Apertures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline supramolecular polymer frameworks (SPFs) with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are readily prepared using three&#8208;arm rigid polyisocyanides as building block via intermolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1&#8197;nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.

         <title>Unexpected Elevated Working Voltage by Na+/Vacancy Ordering and Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage by Transition&#8208;Metal Honeycomb Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material featuring dual&#8208;site ordering superstructures is prepared by simply regulating the calcination time, where the optimized Na+/vacancy ordering significantly elevates the operating voltage and the transition&#8208;metal honeycomb ordering effectively stabilizes the structure, leading to the increased energy density and high cycling stability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Na+/vacancy ordering in sodium&#8208;ion layered oxide cathodes is widely believed to deteriorate the structural stability and retard the Na+ diffusion kinetics, but its unexplored potential advantages remain elusive. Herein, we prepared a P2&#8208;Na0.8Cu0.22Li0.08Mn0.67O2 (NCLMO&#8208;12&#8197;h) material featuring moderate Na+/vacancy and transition&#8208;metal (TM) honeycomb orderings. The appropriate Na+/vacancy ordering significantly enhances the operating voltage and the TM honeycomb ordering effectively strengthens the layered framework. Compared with the disordered material, the well&#8208;balanced dual&#8208;ordering NCLMO&#8208;12&#8197;h cathode affords a boosted working voltage from 2.85 to 3.51&#8197;V, a remarkable ~20&#8201;% enhancement in energy density, and a superior cycling stability (capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;solution reaction with a nearly &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; character, the charge compensation mechanisms, and the reversible inter&#8208;layer Li migration upon sodiation/desodiation are unraveled by systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study breaks the stereotype surrounding Na+/vacancy ordering and provides a new avenue for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;durability sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and tunable ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2O is presented, where the plasma activates inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species reacting with the confined H2O molecules in porous MOF reactors with various compositions and structures.







Abstract
While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the excited nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8722;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Insight into C4 Selectivity in the Light&#8208;Driven C&#8211;H Fluoroalkylation of Pyridines and Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the prevalence of pyridine motifs in FDA&#8208;approved drugs, selective fluoroalkylation of pyridines and quinolines is essential for preparing diverse bioisosteres. However, conventional Minisci reactions often face challenges in achieving precise regioselectivity due to competing reaction sites of pyridine and the limited availability of fluoroalkyl radical sources. Herein, we present a light&#8208;driven, C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation of azines utilizing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts and readily available sulfinates. Our approach employs electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, achieving highly C4&#8208;selective fluoroalkylation under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst. This practical method not only enables the installation of CF2H groups but also allows for the incorporation of CF2&#8208;alkyl groups with diverse functional entities, surpassing the limitations of previous methods. The versatility of the radical pathway is further demonstrated through straightforward three&#8208;component reactions involving alkenes and [1.1.1]propellane. Detailed experimental and computational studies have elucidated the origins of regioselectivity, providing profound insights into the mechanistic aspects.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia&#160;at 1000 &#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8211;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#948;&#8211;&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#948;+&#183;&#183;&#183;:N&#8211;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124 kJ mol&#8211;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating nucleic acid catalysis using active droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell's pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>An Engineered Imine Reductase for Highly Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Branched Amines with Contiguous Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9% ee, &gt;99:1 dr, and &gt;99% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74% yield, &gt;99.9% ee, and 98:2 dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110 g L&#8722;1. Our study provides a highly capable imine reductase and a protocol for developing an efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination reaction system.</dc:description>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8211;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210 nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.</dc:description>

Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8211;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210 nm NIR-II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR-II emitting phosphors to promote its response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures and performance with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Computation&#8208;guided Design of Highly Defined and Dense Bimetallic Active Sites on a Two&#8208;dimensional Conductive Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) provides an alternative method to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. Metal macrocycles with precise coordination are widely used for 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalysis, but they have to be commonly loaded on conductive substrates, thus exposing a large number of 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites that result in poor H2O2 production rate and efficiency. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principle predictions, a substrate&#8208;free and two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co)), composed of Co&#8208;N4 sites in porphine(Co) centers and Ni2O8 nodes, is designed as a multi&#8208;site catalyst for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The approperiate distance between the CoN4 and Ni2O8 sites in Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) weakens the electron transfer between them, thus ensuring their inherent activities and creating high&#8208;density active sites. Meanwhile, the intrinsic electronic conductivity and porosity of Ni&#8208;TCPP(Co) further facilitate rapid reaction kinetics. Therefore, outstanding 2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR electrocatalytic performance has been achieved in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes (&gt;90%/85% H2O2 selectivity within 0&#8208;0.8 V vs. RHE and &gt;18.2/18.0 mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 H2O2 yield under alkaline/neutral conditions), with confirmed feasibility for water purification and disinfection applications.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structure and compact p&#8208;p interaction in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis is a primary global health concern due to its high morbidity and mortality. This disease is characterized by a complex interplay of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Traditional imaging techniques struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes within atherosclerotic plaques. Herein, we have developed a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) that combines specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8226;&#8210;/GSH into a cohesive molecular platform, allowing in vivo monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils within plaques. UMAPP features a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide, and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, enabling NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer, affecting the photoacoustic intensity at 685 nm (PA685), while oxidation and reduction of the catechol groups by O2&#8226;&#8210; and GSH lead to reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum. Preliminary applications of UMAPP have successfully differentiated between atherosclerotic and healthy mice, assessed the impact of pneumonia on plaque composition, and validated the probe&#8217;s efficacy in drug&#8208;treatment studies, detecting molecular changes prior to observable histopathological alterations. UMAPP's integrated molecular imaging approach holds significant promise for advancing the diagnosis and management of atherosclerosis by enabling earlier and more precise detection of vulnerable plaques.</dc:description>

This disease is characterized by a complex interplay of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Traditional imaging techniques struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes within atherosclerotic plaques. Herein, we have developed a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) that combines specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8226;&#8210;/GSH into a cohesive molecular platform, allowing in vivo monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils within plaques. UMAPP features a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE-cleavable tetrapeptide, and dual oxidative stress-responsive catechol moieties, enabling NE-mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer, affecting the photoacoustic intensity at 685 nm (PA685), while oxidation and reduction of the catechol groups by O2&#8226;&#8210; and GSH lead to reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum. Preliminary applications of UMAPP have successfully differentiated between atherosclerotic and healthy mice, assessed the impact of pneumonia on plaque composition, and validated the probe&#8217;s efficacy in drug-treatment studies, detecting molecular changes prior to observable histopathological alterations. UMAPP's integrated molecular imaging approach holds significant promise for advancing the diagnosis and management of atherosclerosis by enabling earlier and more precise detection of vulnerable plaques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30 pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrapodal Hole&#8208;Collecting Monolayer Materials Based on Saddle&#8208;Like Cyclooctatetraene Core for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole&#8208;collecting monolayers have greatly advanced the development of positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs). To date, however, most of the anchoring groups in the reported monolayer materials are designed to bind to the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) surface, resulting in less availability for other functions such as tuning the wettability of the monolayer surface. In this work, we developed two anchorable molecules, 4PATTI&#8208;C3 and 4PATTI&#8208;C4, by employing a saddle&#8208;like indole&#8208;fused cyclooctatetraene as a p&#8208;core with four phosphonic acid anchoring groups linked through propyl or butyl chains. Both molecules form monolayers on TCO substrates. Thanks to the saddle shape of a cyclooctatetraene skeleton, two of the four phosphonic acid anchoring groups were found to point upward, resulting in hydrophilic surfaces. Compared to the devices using 4PATTI&#8208;C4 as the hole&#8208;collecting monolayer, 4PATTI&#8208;C3&#8208;based devices exhibit a faster hole&#8208;collection process, leading to higher power conversion efficiencies of up to 21.7% and 21.4% for a mini&#8208;cell (0.1 cm2) and a mini&#8208;module (1.62 cm2), respectively, together with good operational stability. This work represents how structural modification of multipodal molecules could substantially modulate the functions of the hole&#8208;collecting monolayers after being adsorbed onto TCO substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Confining Conversion Chemistry in Intercalation Host for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host enables an integrated anode structure of iron oxide/hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate. The iron&#8208;based conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer of titanate, achieving long cycle life, fast kinetics, and universal generality to the electrolyte medium. Two unique types of full batteries are further assembled, exhibiting low redox polarization and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type anode materials with high theoretical capacities play a pivotal role in developing future aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs). However, their sustainable applications have long been impeded by the poor cycling stability and sluggish redox kinetics. Here we show that confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host could overcome the above challenges. Using sodium titanates as a model intercalation host, an integrated layered anode material of iron oxide hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate (FeNTO) is demonstrated. The conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer, enabling superlow redox polarization (ca. 4&#8211;6&#8197;times reduced), ultralong lifespan (up to 8700&#8197;cycles) and excellent rate performance. Notably, the charge compensation of interlayer via universal cation intercalation into host endows FeNTO with the capability of operating well in a broad range of aqueous electrolytes (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, etc.). We further demonstrate the large&#8208;scale synthesis of FeNTO thin film and powder, and rational design of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state high&#8208;voltage ARB pouch cells powering wearable electronics against extreme mechanical abuse. This work demonstrates a powerful confinement means to access disruptive electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy devices.

Abstract
A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone-based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. The resultant DS-COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three-fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ranking among the highest reported for organic-based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar-to-fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

         <dc:description>
A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Comprehensive characterization, isotope-labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl-group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl-group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Learning from Protein Engineering by Deconvolution of Multi&#8208;Mutational Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First derivative of a typical experimental enzyme fitness pathway landscape mapped on the basis of &#916;G values, in this case of 24&#8197;trajectories in the deconvolution of a 4&#8208;mutational variant. Green areas indicate negative slopes and define trajectories involved in energetically favored stages, while red areas indicate positive slopes representing energetically disfavored pathways.







Abstract
This review analyzes a development in biochemistry, enzymology and biotechnology that originally came as a surprise. Following the establishment of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes in organic chemistry, the concept of partial or complete deconvolution of selective multi&#8208;mutational variants was introduced. Early deconvolution experiments of stereoselective variants led to the finding that mutations can interact cooperatively or antagonistically with one another, not just additively. During the past decade, this phenomenon was shown to be general. In some studies, molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computations were performed in order to shed light on the origin of non&#8208;additivity at all stages of an evolutionary upward climb. Data of complete deconvolution can be used to construct unique multi&#8208;dimensional rugged fitness pathway landscapes, which provide mechanistic insights different from traditional fitness landscapes. Along a related line, biochemists have long tested the result of introducing two point mutations in an enzyme for mechanistic reasons, followed by a comparison of the respective double mutant in so&#8208;called double mutant cycles, which originally showed only additive effects, but more recently also uncovered cooperative and antagonistic non&#8208;additive effects. We conclude with suggestions for future work, and call for a unified overall picture of non&#8208;additivity and epistasis.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).

         <title>Harnessing Cooperative Multivalency in Thioguanine for Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)&#8208;Based Differentiation of Polyfunctional Analytes Differing by a Single Functional Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6&#8208;Thioguanine (TG), as a receptor capable of forming multidentate cooperative hydrogen bonding, enables the interaction with less&#8208;reactive functional groups and strengthens receptor&#8208;analyte complexation to achieve analyte&#8208;specific surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for accurate polyfunctional analog identification.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule receptors are increasingly employed to probe various functional groups for (bio)chemical analysis. However, differentiation of polyfunctional analogs sharing multiple functional groups remains challenging for conventional mono&#8208; and bidentate receptors because their insufficient number of binding sites limits interactions with the least reactive yet property&#8208;determining functional group. Herein, we introduce 6&#8208;thioguanine (TG) as a supramolecular receptor for unique tridentate receptor&#8208;analyte complexation, achieving &#8805;97&#8201;% identification accuracy among 16 polyfunctional analogs across three classes: glycerol derivatives, disubstituted propane, and vicinal diols. Crucially, we demonstrate distinct spectral changes induced by the tridentate interaction between TG's three anchoring points and all the analyte's functional groups, even the least reactive ones. Notably, hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) networks formed in the TG&#8208;analyte complexes demonstrate additive effects in binding strength originating from good bond linearity, cooperativity, and resonance, thus strengthening complexation events and amplifying the differences in spectral changes induced among analytes. It also enhances spectral consistency by selectively forming a sole configuration that is stronger than the respective analyte&#8208;analyte interaction. Finally, we achieve 95.4&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex identification of a mixture consisting of multiple polyfunctional analogs. We envisage that extension to other multidentate non&#8208;covalent interactions enables the development of interference&#8208;free small molecule&#8208;based sensors for various (bio)chemical analysis applications.

         <title>Coordination Desymmetrization of Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that asymmetric coordination of single&#8208;atom copper catalysts can greatly enhance the efficiency and stability of NO3RR catalysis, which attributes to the accumulation of NO3&#8722; on the surface and the reduction of the energy barrier regarding the formation of the key reaction intermediate.







Abstract
Coordination engineering strategy for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has been rapidly developed over the last decade. However, previous reports on copper SACs for nitrate reduction reactions (NO3RR) have mostly focused on symmetric coordination configurations such as Cu&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3. In addition, the mechanism in terms of the regulation of coordination environment and catalytic properties of SACs has not been well demonstrated. Herein, we disrupted the local symmetric structure of copper atoms by introducing unsaturated heteroatomic coordination of Cu&#8722;O and Cu&#8722;N to achieve the coordination desymmetrization of Cu&#8208;N1O2 SACs. The Cu&#8208;N1O2 SACs exhibit an efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with a high FE of ~96.5&#8201;% and a yield rate of 3120&#8197;&#956;g NH3 h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#8197;V vs RHE. As indicated by in situ Raman spectra, the catalysts facilitate the accumulation of NO3&#8722; and the selective adsorption of *NO2, which were further confirmed by the theoretical study of surface dipole moment and orbital hybridization. Our work illustrated the correlation between the coordination desymmetrization and the catalytic performance of copper SACs for NO3RR.

         <title>2,2&#8208;Difluoroethylation of Heteroatom Nucleophiles via a Hypervalent Iodine Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hypervalent iodine(III) reagent is disclosed for 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation of thiols, amines and alcohols via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. A range of pharmaceutically relevant nucleophiles are difluoroethylated, including morpholine, glucose and the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.







Abstract
The 2,2&#8208;difluoroethyl group is an important lipophilic hydrogen bond donor in medicinal chemistry, but its incorporation into small molecules is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate electrophilic 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation of thiol, amine and alcohol nucleophiles with a hypervalent iodine reagent, (2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;ethyl)(aryl)iodonium triflate, via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. This transformation offers a complementary strategy to existing 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylation methods and allows access to a wide range of 2,2&#8208;difluoroethylated nucleophiles, including the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.

&lt;p&gt;A new hypervalent iodine(III) reagent is disclosed for 2,2-difluoroethylation of thiols, amines and alcohols via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. A range of pharmaceutically relevant nucleophiles are difluoroethylated, including morpholine, glucose and the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2,2-difluoroethyl group is an important lipophilic hydrogen bond donor in medicinal chemistry, but its incorporation into small molecules is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate electrophilic 2,2-difluoroethylation of thiol, amine and alcohol nucleophiles with a hypervalent iodine reagent, (2,2-difluoro-ethyl)(aryl)iodonium triflate, via a proposed ligand coupling mechanism. This transformation offers a complementary strategy to existing 2,2-difluoroethylation methods and allows access to a wide range of 2,2-difluoroethylated nucleophiles, including the drugs Captopril, Normorphine and Mefloquine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stable Site&#8208;Isolated Mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst on a Metal&#8208;Organic Layer for Highly Efficient Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a highly efficient and reusable metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) catalyst is described. The stable site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;rhodium complex on the MOL exhibits high catalytic efficiency in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes and the reduction of nitriles to primary amines with turnover numbers of up to 390000 due to the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;ligated transition metal complexes play a pivotal role in modern catalysis, but our understanding of the impact of ligand counts on the catalysis performance of the metal center is limited. Here we report the synthesis of a low&#8208;coordinate mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh catalyst on a metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL), P&#8208;MOL&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;Rh, and its applications in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes as well as aryl nitriles with turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 390000. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations revealed the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh sites on the MOL to provide superior catalytic activity over homogeneous Rh catalysts. The MOL also prevents catalyst deactivation to enable recycle and reuse of P&#8208;MOL&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;Rh in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>In situ Generation of Cyclohexanone Drives Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Phenol to Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling in situ generated intermediates with other substrates/intermediates is a viable approach for diversifying product outcomes of catalytic reactions involving two or multiple reactants. Cyclohexanone oxime is a key precursor for caprolactam synthesis (the monomer of Nylon&#8208;6), yet its current production uses unsustainable carbon sources, noble metal catalysts, and harsh conditions. Herein, we report the first work to synthesize cyclohexanone oxime through electroreduction of phenol and hydroxylamine. The Faradaic efficiency reached 69.1% over Cu catalyst, accompanied by a corresponding cyclohexanone oxime formation rate of 82.0 g h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1. In addition, the conversion of phenol was up to 97.5%. In situ characterizations, control experiments, and theoretical calculations suggested the importance of balanced activation of water, phenol, and hydroxylamine substrates on the optimal metallic Cu catalyst for achieving high&#8208;performance cyclohexanone oxime synthesis. Besides, a tandem catalytic route for the upgrading of lignin to caprolactam has been successfully developed through the integration of thermal catalysis, electrocatalysis, and Beckmann rearrangement, which achieved the synthesis of 0.40 g of caprolactam from 4.0 g of lignin raw material.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Highly Reversible Flexible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. However, most of hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for highly reversible flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100 kPa and 5338%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400 h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalized tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8211;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8211;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8211;Tz in an in vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time.&#160;Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation.&#160;Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8211; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion.&#160;Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8211; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolved Protein Imaging Using Bifunctional Light&#8208;Up Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient labeling methods for protein visualization with minimal tag size and appropriate photophysical properties are required for single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), providing insights into the organization and interactions of biomolecules in cells at the molecular level. Among the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers (FLAPs) originally developed for RNA imaging, RhoBAST stands out due to its remarkable brightness, photostability, fluorogenicity, and rapid exchange kinetics, enabling super&#8208;resolved imaging with high localization precision. Here, we expand the applicability of RhoBAST to protein imaging by fusing it to protein&#8208;binding aptamers. The versatility of such bifunctional aptamers is demonstrated by employing a variety of protein&#8208;binding aptamers and different FLAPs. Moreover, fusing RhoBAST with the GFP&#8208;binding aptamer AP3 facilitates high&#8208; and super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP&#8208;tagged proteins, which is particularly valuable in view of the widespread availability of plasmids and stable cell lines expressing proteins fused to GFP. The bifunctional aptamers compare favorably with standard antibody&#8208;based immunofluorescence protocols, as they are 7&#8208;fold smaller than antibody conjugates and exhibit higher bleaching&#8208;resistance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in super&#8208;resolution microscopy in secondary mammalian cell lines and primary neurons by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, an SMLM protein imaging technique that leverages the transient binding of the fluorogenic rhodamine dye SpyRho to RhoBAST.</dc:description>

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Brings High Electron Delocalization for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike many studies that regulate transport and separation behaviour of photogenerated charge carriers through controlling the chemical composite, our work demonstrates this goal can be achieved through simply tuning the molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) without altering the building blocks or network topology. Further investigations reveal that the long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking significantly promotes electron delocalization and enhances electron density, thereby effectively suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination and augmenting the charge transfer rate. Simultaneously, acting as a porous substrate, it boosts electron density of Pd nanoparticle loaded on its surfaces, resulting in remarkable CO2 photoreduction catalytic activity (CO generation rate: 48.1 &#956;mol/g/h) without the need for hole scavengers. Our study provide insight into regulating the charge carrier behaviours in molecular assemblies based on hydrogen bonds, offering a new clue for efficient photocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8208;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4% and 56.5% at &#8208;1.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480 mA cm&#8208;2. The in situ Raman measurements and control experiments indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Intermediate&#8208;Size&#160;m&#8208;Xylene from Xylenes via a Length&#8208;Matched Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Optimal Oxygen Sites Distribution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xylene separation is crucial but challenging, especially for the preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene from xylene mixtures. Herein, exploiting the differences in molecular length and alkyl distribution among xylenes, we present a length&#8208;matched metal&#8208;organic framework, formulated as Al(OH)[O2C&#8208;C4H2O&#8208;CO2], featuring an effective&#160;pore size corresponding to m&#8208;xylene molecular length combined with multiple negative O hydrogen bond donors distribution, can serve as a molecular trap for efficient preferential separation of the intermediate&#8208;size m&#8208;xylene. Benchmark separation performance was achieved for separating m&#8208;xylene from a ternary mixture of m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene, with simultaneous record&#8208;high m&#8208;xylene uptake (1.3 mmol g&#8208;1) and m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene selectivity (5.3) in the liquid&#8208;phase competitive adsorption. Both vapor&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase fixed&#8208;bed tests confirmed its practical separation capability with benchmark dynamic m&#8208;xylene/p&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene/o&#8208;xylene selectivities, as well as excellent regenerability. The selective and strong m&#8208;xylene binding affinity among xylene molecules was further elucidated by simulations, validating the effectiveness of such a pore environment for the separation of intermediate&#8208;size molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, the practical application is still suffering from the decreased function, inadequate infiltration, and immunosuppressive microenvironment in solid tumor. Herein, we construct the light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on NK cell surface, it forms a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories, capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. The NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, the NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze to produce FDA approved immune agonist, imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role by inducing DC maturation for NK cells activation and reshaping tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cells infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a new strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles to generate valuable carbonyl derivatives under visible light irradiation. This method is mild, robust, highly selective, and proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions to prepare a range of structurally diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. In addition, we highlight the application of this activation strategy for 13C isotopic incorporation. We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford radical anions from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron&#8208;oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.</dc:description>

We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford radical anions from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron-oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas, their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emission to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense nonradiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710 nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e.&#65292;crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8208;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the nonradiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs, but also helps understand the NIR RTP origin to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Cage Membranes Constructed Using Fortified Intermolecular Interactions for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage (POC) membranes were constructed via interfacial polymerization at room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions for molecular sieving. The crystalline POC membranes were fabricated by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Among the various types of materials with intrinsic porosity, porous organic cages (POCs) are distinctive as discrete molecules that possess intrinsic cavities and extrinsic channels capable of facilitating molecular sieving. However, the fabrication of POC membranes remains highly challenging due to the weak noncovalent intermolecular interactions and most reported POCs are powders. In this study, we constructed crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage membranes by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To elucidate the driving forces behind, a series of terephthaldehyde building blocks containing different substitutions were reacted with flexible triamine under different conditions via interfacial polymerization (IP). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can significantly boost the intermolecular interactions. The resulting membranes exhibited fast solvent permeance and high rejection of dyes not only in water, but also in organic solvents. In addition, the membrane demonstrated excellent performance in precise molecular sieving in organic solvents. This work opens an avenue to designing and fabricating free&#8208;standing membranes composed of porous organic materials for efficient molecular sieving.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative (&lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt;) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (&lt;b&gt;TTF&lt;/b&gt;) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (&lt;b&gt;PEG&lt;/b&gt;) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (&lt;b&gt;PerF&lt;/b&gt;) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two-electron-active &lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt; catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|&lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt; batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of &lt;b&gt;(PEG3/PerF)-TTF&lt;/b&gt;, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two&#8208;electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(dxpy)2]NTf2 (x=P&#8208;substituent, y=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the RhI parents, Rh&#8722;I d10&#8208;complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including 103Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first E0(RhI/0) and second E0(Rh0/&#8722;I) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh&#8208;P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two&#8208;electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Like Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Materials Based on Polyfluorinated Imidazolium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures. This study may pave the way towards a new class of perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability (331 mAh g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles at 100 mA g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of 167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.4 A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8211;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39 pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to the ampere level (achieving over 80% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859 mA cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. The best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers.







Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling leads to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</dc:description>

         <title>[19]Starphene: Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis Towards the Largest Starphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9 eV).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8208;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type 2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8208;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9 nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ON&#8208;OFF effect of amine ligand enabled Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of propargyl ester bearing a terminal alkyne moiety using hydrosilane was achieved. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the improvement of reactivity. The tertiary amine plays a significant role in assisting the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.







Abstract
Described herein is a dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON&#8208;OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts Allenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuning Localized Excitons Toward Enhanced Emission, Photocurrent Enhancement and Piezochromism in Unconventional ACI&#8208;Type 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous enhancement of free excitons (FEs) emission and self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission remains greatly challenging because of the radiative pathway competition. Here, a significant fluorescence improvement, associated with the radiative recombination of both FEs and STEs is firstly achieved in an unconventional ACI&#8208;type hybrid perovskite, (ACA)(MA)PbI4 (ACA=acetamidinium) crystals with {PbI6} octahedron units, through hydrostatic pressure processing. Note that (ACA)(MA)PbI4 exhibits a 91.5&#8208;fold emission enhancement and considerable piezochromism from green to red in a mild pressure interval of 1 atm to 2.5 GPa. The substantial distortion of both individual halide octahedron and the Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angles between two halide octahedra under high pressure indeed determines the pressure&#8208;tuning localized excitons behavior. Upon higher pressure, photocurrent enhancement is also observed, which is attributed to the promoted electronic connectivity in (ACA)(MA)PbI4. The anisotropic compaction reduces the distance between neighboring organic molecules and {PbI6} octahedra, leading to the enhancement of hydrogen bonding interactions. This work not only offers a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;optical relationships of ACI&#8208;type perovskites, but also presents insights into breaking the limits of luminescent efficiency by pressure&#8208;suppressed nonradiative recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8208; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8208; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;S&#8211;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8211;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37 mg L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97% for over 200 hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8211;S&#8211;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Interactions Promoted Activation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia over Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers a promising pathway for ammonia synthesis. The interfacial electronic interactions (IEIs) can regulate the physicochemical capabilities of catalysts in electrochemical applications, while the impact of IEIs on electrocatalytic NRA remains largely unexplored in current literature. In this study, the high&#8208;efficiency electrode Ag&#8208;modified Co3O4 (Ag1.5Co/CC) is prepared for NRA in neutral media, exhibiting an impressive nitrate conversion rate of 96.86%, ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 96.11%, and ammonia selectivity of ~100%. Notably, the intrinsic activity of Ag1.5Co/CC is ~81 times that of Ag nanoparticles (Ag/CC). Multiple characterizations and theoretical computations confirm the presence of IEIs between Ag and Co3O4, which stabilize the CoO6 octahedrons within Co3O4 and significantly promote the adsorption of reactants (NO3&#8722;) as well as intermediates (NO2&#8722; and NO), while suppressing the Heyrovsky step, thereby improving nitrate electroreduction efficiency. Furthermore, our findings reveal a synergistic effect between different active sites that enables tandem catalysis for NRA: NO3&#8722; reduction to NO2&#8722; predominantly occurs at Ag sites while NO2&#8722; tends to hydrogenate to ammonia at Co sites. This study offers valuable insights for the development of high&#8208;performance NRA electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Hydroxyallylation of Cyclopropenes with Cyclopropanols via NHC Catalysis of Transient Organozinc Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stereoselective hydroxyallylation reaction of cyclopropenes with cyclopropanols is achieved under zinc&#8208;mediated conditions, affording densely functionalized cyclopropanes with excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters within and outside the cyclopropane ring. A racemic variant of the reaction is synergistically promoted by catalytic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and organic base, whereas chiral amino alcohol&#8208;derived bifunctional NHC enables a catalytic enantioselective variant. The reaction likely involves the generation of enolized zinc homoenolate via ring&#8208;opening of zinc cyclopropoxide and enolization of the resulting homoenolate, followed by its addition to the cyclopropene as a prochiral allylzinc nucleophile. Our mechanistic investigations highlighted the transient nature of enolized homoenolate, which, once generated from thermodynamically predominant cyclopropoxide, immediately proceeds to allylzincation with cyclopropene. The NHC not only promotes the rate&#8208;determining generation of enolized homoenolate but also engages in the allylzincation process. The resulting cyclopropylzinc species undergoes partial in situ protonation while partially remaining intact, thereby leaving an opportunity for trapping with an external electrophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589 nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out switch of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.</dc:description>

Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC-co-NBDAP)-b-P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co-crystallization-assistant self-assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi-stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle-like, curved rod-like micelles, finally to end-to-end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy-PS while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self-assembly to co-crystallization-assistant self-assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in-to-out switch of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion&#160;Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M = 5, 6; N = 4&#8722;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33 examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt; 20:1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. We introduce a novel cleavable&#160;&#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of&#160;&#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with&#160;&#946;&#8208;ketoester through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, cross&#8208;links&#160;with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. Cross&#8208;linking improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young&#8217;s modulus and toughness that reach up to 656 MPa and 84 MJ cm&#8208;3, i.e. 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, allowing the almost PVA excellent recovery (&gt; 90%) . In the absence of thermal or acidic treatment, cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advancements in catalytic synthesis of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. In this study, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <title>Front Cover: Poly(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)&#8208;Capped Alloy and Core&#8208;Shell AuAg Bimetallic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are employed to covalently anchor Au and Ag atoms, resulting in bimetallic random copolymers, as reported by Ali Nazemi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409800). When these polymers are used as substrates and undergo reduction, they produce polyNHC&#8208;capped alloy and core&#8208;shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, whose structures are influenced by the proportion of each metal in the metallopolymer. These nanomaterials have been shown to be effective in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction.

When these polymers are used as substrates and undergo reduction, they produce polyNHC-capped alloy and core-shell AuAg bimetallic nanoparticles, whose structures are influenced by the proportion of each metal in the metallopolymer. These nanomaterials have been shown to be effective in electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

         <title>The Use of Photocycloaddition Reactions to Drive Mechanical Motions Resembling Humanoid Movements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline molecular material with olefinic groups has been used to achieve photomechanical motion in both single crystals and single&#8208;crystal composite films. This dimerization of dipyridyl ligands by [2+2] photocycloaddition introduces strain within the crystal, resulting in a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical including reversible bending and curling, movements that resemble a human performing various gymnastic exercises.







Abstract
With the aim of producing a photomechanical material for incorporation in soft microrobots, a one&#8208;dimensional diene coordination polymer (CP) [Cd(F&#8208;bpeb)(3&#8208;CBA)2]n (CP1, F&#8208;bpeb=4,4&#8242;&#8208;((1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(ethene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl))dipyridine, 3&#8208;HCBA=3&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid) was synthesized and characterized. Irradiation of CP1 with ultraviolet (UV) or visible light causes [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions resulting in the introduction of crystal strain which triggers various types of crystal movements. Composite films of CP1&#8208;PVA (SC) fabricated by dispersing CP1 crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution allow amplification of the crystal movement so that the film strips exhibit fast and flexible curling upon photoirradiation. The composite films may be cut into long rectangular strips and folded to simulate soft microrobots which exhibit a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical movements resembling a human performing various gymnastic exercises.

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this combined experimental (X&#8208;ray structure analysis) and computational (DFT&#8208;D3 calculations) study we have systematically evaluated the &#960;&#8208;hole donor ability of elements across Groups 9 to 12 using metalated porphyrins (ppys) as model systems. The results obtained will make impact in the fields supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and catalysis, where noncovalent Lewis Base&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal interactions play a crucial role.







Abstract
Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M=Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of 2D/3D frameworks from 2D aromatics is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Ken Tanaka, Yuki Nagashima et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403461). The cover mage shows transformations from 2D quinolines into triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D rings through nucleophilic addition, borate complex formation, and photocycloaddition. Mechanistic studies revealed that the borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state.

         <title>Front Cover: Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion into a Mott&#8211;Hubbard system emerges as an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical materials. In their Research Article (e202406941), Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang employ lattice distortion to provide two distinct transition pathways with varying probabilities, while the Mott&#8211;Hubbard configuration ensures the transition sequence.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion into a Mott&#8211;Hubbard system emerges as an effective strategy for developing high-performance nonlinear optical materials. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202406941"&gt;e202406941&lt;/a&gt;), Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang employ lattice distortion to provide two distinct transition pathways with varying probabilities, while the Mott&#8211;Hubbard configuration ensures the transition sequence. This synergistic design unveils the excited-state absorption in (MA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling these materials to simultaneously exhibit a large nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synapse&#8208;mimicking nanopipette method was developed to electrochemically monitor single vesicle dynamics induced by lipid&#8208;tau interactions. To mimic the lipid environment in synapses, model vesicles and a modified lipid layer were confined within a nanopipette, as reported by Ru&#8208;Jia Yu, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202406677). Characteristic ionic current oscillations were recorded and could be used to evaluate the binding affinity of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylated tau inhibits vesicle dynamics through strong interactions with synaptic vesicles.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;Valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional assembles were successfully obtained from spherical polyoxometalates and multinuclear platinum complexes. Each assemble has mixed&#8208;valent metal oxidation states and unpaired electrons on metal d orbitals, showing semiconducting behaviours, which was 105 times greater than that of the parent polyoxometalates.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt;10&#8722;10&#8201;Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown-6 (&lt;b&gt;TPy18C6&lt;/b&gt;), for COF fabrication (&lt;b&gt;ACE-COF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;ACE-COF-2&lt;/b&gt;) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped COFs (&lt;b&gt;Ni@ACE-COF-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ni@ACE-COF-2&lt;/b&gt;) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and exceptional cycling stability (&amp;gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel-zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic-synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconstruction of Ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic Cobalt&#8208;based Electrocatalysts under Gradient Magnetic Fields for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8208;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering the Site Distance of Atomic Cu&#8208;Cu Pairs by First&#8208;Shell Halogen Coordination Boosts CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C&#8208;C coupling to unravel their structure&#8208;performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first&#8208;shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu (Cu&#8208;I&#8208;Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu dual site is accelerated to C2H4 generation and short&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu (Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cu) dual site is beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long&#8208;range Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C&#8208;C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site&#8208;distance&#8208;dependent electrochemical property to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of haloboranes: from synthesis of hydroboranes to formal hydroboration reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroboranes are versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we report a new method for the preparation of hydroboranes from hydrogen and the corresponding haloboranes. Triethylamine (NEt3) form with dialkylchloroboranes a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H2 and afford the desired hydroborane with ammonium salts. Unreactive haloboranes were unlocked using a catalytic amount of Cy2BCl, enabling the synthesis of commonly used hydroboranes such as pinacolborane or catecholborane. The mechanisms of these reactions have been examined by DFT studies, highlighting the importance of the base selection. Finally, the system's robustness has been evaluated in one&#8208;pot B&#8208;Cl hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Reliable Operation of All&#8208;Climate 4.8 V Li||NCM811 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes with lithium metal anodes is among the most promising approaches for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. However, most current electrolytes fail to simultaneously satisfy the compatibility requirements for the lithium metal anode and the tolerance for the ultra&#8208;high voltage NCM811 cathode. Here, we have designed an ultra&#8208;oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte by meticulously adjusting the composition of fluorinated carbonates. Our study reveals that a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in LiF and Li2O is constructed on the lithium anode through the synergistic decomposition of the fluorinated solvents and PF6&#8208; anion, facilitating smooth lithium metal deposition. The superior oxidation resistance of our electrolyte enables the Li||NCM811 cell to deliver a capacity retention of 80% after 300 cycles at an ultrahigh cut&#8722;off voltage of 4.8 V. Additionally, a pioneering 4.8 V&#8208;class lithium metal pouch cell with an energy density of 462.2 Wh kg&#8208;1 stably cycles for 110 cycles under harsh conditions of high cathode loading (30 mg cm&#8208;2), low N/P ratio (1.18), and lean electrolytes (2.3 g Ah&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8211;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar chiral skeletons widely exist in natural products, bioactive compounds, and other functional molecules. Although significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric synthesis of central or axial chiral molecules over the past years, enantioselective constructing of planar chirality is still a big obstacle and numerous efforts have been made in this field. Previous works have mainly focused on the assembly of planar chiral [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes and metallocenes. This Minireview describes the recent advancements on asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar chiral macrocycles, including ansa chain construction, plane formation and asymmetric transformation strategies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will sever as a source of inspiration for developing new unconventional procedures for access to planar chiral skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Redox&#8208;active Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;based Memristors for&#160;Highly&#8208;efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic memristors based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant potential for future neuromorphic computing applications. The preparation of high&#8208;quality COF nanosheets through appropriate structural design and building block selection is critical for the enhancement of memristor performance. In this study, a novel room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;phase method was used to synthesize Ta&#8208;Cu3 COF, which contains two redox&#8208;active units: trinuclear copper and triphenylamine. The resultant COF nanosheets were dispersed through acid&#8208;assisted exfoliation and subsequently spin&#8208;coated to fabricate a high&#8208;quality COF film on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. The synergistic effect of the dual redox&#8208;active centers in the COF film, combined with its distinct crystallinity, significantly reduces the redox energy barrier, enabling the efficient modulation of 128 non&#8208;volatile conductive states in the Al/Ta&#8208;Cu3 COF/ITO memristor. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on these 128 conductance states, image recognition for ten representative campus landmarks was successfully executed, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.13% after 25 training epochs. Compared to devices based on binary conductance states, the memristor with 128 conductance states exhibits a 45.56% improvement in recognition accuracy and significantly enhances the efficiency of neuromorphic computing.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;On&#8208;Line&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive.&#160;&#160;&#160;Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid sidechain required for biological activity. Here, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with 6 asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0&#160;and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid Orbitrap&#8208;Nanoelectromechanical Systems Approach for the Analysis of Individual, Intact Proteins in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectromechanical systems&#8208;based mass spectrometry (NEMS&#8208;MS) determines the mass of individual particles by monitoring resonance frequency changes in tiny mechanical devices. Incorporating NEMS into an Orbitrap instrument enhances the dynamic range and enables deep proteomic analysis. This work measures E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules, showing good agreement with the known mass.







Abstract
Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)&#8208;based mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technique that enables determination of the mass of individual adsorbed particles by driving nanomechanical devices at resonance and monitoring the real&#8208;time changes in their resonance frequencies induced by each single molecule adsorption event. We incorporate NEMS into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and report our progress towards leveraging the single&#8208;molecule capabilities of the NEMS to enhance the dynamic range of conventional MS instrumentation and to offer new capabilities for performing deep proteomic analysis of clinically relevant samples. We use the hybrid instrument to deliver E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules (801&#8197;kDa) to the NEMS devices in their native, intact state. Custom ion optics are used to focus the beam down to 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter with a maximum flux of 25&#8197;molecules/second. The mass spectrum obtained with NEMS&#8208;MS shows good agreement with the known mass of GroEL.

         <title>Precise Helium Sieving from Hydrogen Using Fluorine&#8208;Decorated Carbon Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fiber membranes enables the tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities.







Abstract
Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H2), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large&#8208;scale, energy&#8208;efficient He/H2 separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers. We demonstrate that the fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fibers enables tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The fluorinated HFM&#8208;550&#8208;F&#8208;1&#8197;min membrane exhibits exceptional mixed&#8208;gas separation performance, with a binary mixed&#8208;gas He/H2 selectivity of 10.5 and a ternary mixed&#8208;gas He/(H2+CO2) selectivity of 20.8, at 40&#8197;bar feed pressure and 35&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing all previously reported polymer&#8208;based gas separation membranes, and remarkable plasticization resistance and long&#8208;term continuous stability over 30&#8197;days.

         <title>Photoredox/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling to Access C(sp3)&#8208;Rich gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and highly selective decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling diborylmethylation of various alkyl carboxylic acids with a gem&#8208;diboryl metallic reagent has been accomplished via dual photoredox/copper catalysis providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176;&#8201;&#946; positions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes are highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry due to their ability to participate in multi&#8208;step cross&#8208;coupling transformations, allowing for the rapid generation of molecular complexity. While progress has been made in their synthetic metholodology, the construction of &#946;&#8208;tertiary and C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes remains a synthetic challenge due to substrate limitations and steric hindrance issues. An approach is presented that utilizes synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis to achieve efficient C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, which can easily be obtained from alkyl carboxylic acids, with diborylmethyl species, providing a series of C(sp3)&#8208;rich gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176; &#946; positions. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to complex medicinal compounds and natural products, offering rapid access to molecular complexity and late&#8208;stage functionalization of C(sp3)&#8208;rich drug candidates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that diborylmethyl Cu(I) species participated in both the photoredox process and the key C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming step.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-Diborylalkanes are highly valuable building blocks in organic synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry due to their ability to participate in multi-step cross-coupling transformations, allowing for the rapid generation of molecular complexity. While progress has been made in their synthetic metholodology, the construction of &#946;-tertiary and C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diborylalkanes remains a synthetic challenge due to substrate limitations and steric hindrance issues. An approach is presented that utilizes synergistic photoredox and copper catalysis to achieve efficient C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) cross-coupling of alkyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphthalimide esters, which can easily be obtained from alkyl carboxylic acids, with diborylmethyl species, providing a series of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diborylalkanes with 1&#176;, 2&#176;, and even 3&#176; &#946; positions. Furthermore, this approach can also be applied to complex medicinal compounds and natural products, offering rapid access to molecular complexity and late-stage functionalization of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich drug candidates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that diborylmethyl Cu(I) species participated in both the photoredox process and the key C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond-forming step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycol Monomethyl Ether&#8208;Substituted Carbazolyl Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 25.52&#8201;%</title>

A novel hole&#8208;transporting material [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) is synthesized by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) at carbazolyl unit, which facilitates the spreading of perovskite, has well matching energy band with perovskite, suppresses defects and releases residual stress at buried interface of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Consequently, GM&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based IPSCs engender a high efficiency of 25.52&#8201;% and an excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled molecules (OSAMs) based hole&#8208;transporting materials play a pivotal role in achieving highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, the reported carbazol&#8208;based OSAMs have serious drawbacks, such as poor wettability for perovskite solution spreading due to the nonpolar surface, worse matched energy arrangement with perovskite, and limited molecular species, which greatly limit the device performance. To address above problems, a novel OSAM [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) was synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting material by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) side chains at carbazolyl unit. GM groups enhance the surface energy of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/SAM substrate to facilitate the nucleation and growth of up perovskite film, suppress cation defects, release the residual stress at SAM/perovskite interface, and evaluate energy level for matching with perovskite. Consequently, the GM&#8208;4PACz based IPSC achieves a champion PCE of 25.52&#8201;%, a respectable open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.21&#8197;V, a high stability, possessing 93.29&#8201;% and 91.75&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 2000&#8197;h or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>Hyperpolarization of 15N&#8208;Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 15N&#8208;labelled tracer for magnetic resonance is introduced that is signal enhanced using parahydrogen and the feasibility for first pilot 15N in vivo studies is demonstrated.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on 13C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of 15N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported 15N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced 15N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para&#8208;hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H2O2 level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H2O2 probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H2O2 and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N signal detection. The present work manifests its great potential not only for reaction based reactive sensing probes but also promises to serve as a platform to develop other contrast agents.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Activation of Copper/Silicon Interface for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedentedly reveals the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu/BSi interface during photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, which was validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by a light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The adaptive junction is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.







Abstract
Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially the possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is unprecedentedly demonstrated to reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface during photoelectrocatalysis, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu&#8722;Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance for CO2 electroreduction, which efficiently restricts the C&#8722;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products and an intriguing selectivity switch. This work offers new insights into dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction and design of highly efficient catalysts toward photosynthesis.

         <title>Construction of Benzoxazine&#8208;linked One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Using the Mannich Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline 1D benzoxazine&#8208;linked covalent organic polymers have been successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques.







Abstract
Covalent polymerization of organic molecules into crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polymers is effective for achieving desired thermal, optical, and electrical properties, yet it remains a persistent synthetic challenge for their inherent tendency to adopt amorphous or semicrystalline phases. Here we report a strategy to synthesize crystalline 1D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composing quasi&#8208;conjugated chains with benzoxazine linkages via the one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. Through [4+2] and [2+2] type Mannich condensation reactions, we fabricated stoichiometric and sub&#8208;stoichiometric 1D covalent polymeric chains, respectively, using doubly and singly linked benzoxazine rings. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalizations of them with a chiral MacMillan catalyst produce crystalline organic photocatalysts that demonstrated excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in light&#8208;driven asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes, affording up to 94&#8201;% enantiomeric excess

The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state-of-the-art cryogenic low-dose electron microscopy techniques. Post-synthetic functionalizations of them with a chiral MacMillan catalyst produce crystalline organic photocatalysts that demonstrated excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in light-driven asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes, affording up to 94&#8201;% enantiomeric excess&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing An Oxyhalide Interface for 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;Tolerant High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high voltage stable uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is synthesized via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Compared with conventional coating, this oxyhalide coating exhibits high ionic conductivity and excellent high voltage stability. Therefore, the interfacial side reactions between NCM811 and sulfide solid electrolytes can be effectively suppressed even at high voltage, thus the interfacial products can be well abridged.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high&#8208;voltage conditions. However, the interface compatibility issues remain to be solved at the interface between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte. To circumvent this issue, we propose a simple but effective approach to magic the adverse surface alkali into a uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Due to the enhancement of the close contact at interface, the ASSBs exhibit improved kinetic performance across a broad temperature range, especially at the freezing point. Besides, owing to the high&#8208;voltage tolerance of the protective layer, ASSBs demonstrate excellent cyclic stability under high cutoff voltages (500&#8197;cycles~94.0&#8201;% at 4.5&#8197;V, 200&#8197;cycles~80.4&#8201;% at 4.8&#8197;V). This work provides insights into using a high voltage stable oxyhalide coating strategy to enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.

         <title>Umpolung&#8208;Enabled Divergent Dearomative Carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dearomative carbonylation mode involving sequential nucleophile/nucleophile addition across benzene &#960;&#8208;bonds enables the divergent synthesis of esters and amides by tolerating a broad spectrum of benzene derivatives, nucleophilic partners, alcohols, and amines. The versatility of the process further allows for the tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes and the construction of quaternary carbon centers.







Abstract
Although dearomative functionalizations enable the direct conversion of flat aromatics into precious three&#8208;dimensional architectures, the case for simple arenes remains largely underdeveloped owing to the high aromatic stabilization energy. We herein report a dearomative sequential addition of two nucleophiles to arene &#960;&#8208;bonds through umpolung of chromium&#8211;arene complexes. This mode enables divergent dearomative carbonylation reactions of benzene derivatives by tolerating various nucleophiles in combination with alcohols or amines under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, thus providing modular access to functionalized esters or amides. The tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes as well as the construction of carbon quaternary centers further highlight the versatility of this dearomatization. Diverse late&#8208;stage modifications and derivatizations towards synthetically challenging and bioactive molecules reveal the synthetic utility. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments and intermediate tracking.

         <title>Expedited Synthesis of Metal Phosphides Maximizes Dispersion, Air Stability, and Catalytic Performance in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis based on cheap and safe precursors delivers a wide range of supported metal phosphides with small particle diameters and high dispersion. Ni2P/Al2O3 prepared in this fashion is a bench&#8208;stable catalyst that delivers activity on par with the Pd&#8208;based benchmark catalyst in alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have been hailed as potential replacements for scarce noble metal catalysts in many aspects of the hydrogen economy from hydrogen evolution to selective hydrogenation reactions. But the need for dangerous and costly phosphorus precursors, limited support dispersion, and low stability of the metal phosphide surface toward oxidation substantially lower the appeal and performance of metal phosphides in catalysis. We show here that a 1&#8208;step procedure that relies on safe and cheap precursors can furnish an air&#8208;stable Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3.2&#8197;nm nanoparticles. Ni2P/Al2O3&#8201;1&#8208;step is kinetically competitive with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst in selective hydrogenation catalysis, and a loading corresponding to 4&#8197;ppm Ni was sufficient to convert 0.1&#8197;mol alkyne. The 1&#8208;step synthetic procedure alters the surface ligand speciation of Ni2P/Al2O3, which protects the nanoparticle surface from oxidation, and ensures that 85&#8201;% of the initial catalytic activity was retained after the catalyst was stored under air for 1.5&#8197;years. Preparation of Ni2P on a variety of supports (silica, TiO2, SBA&#8208;15, ZrO2, C and HAP) as well as Co2P/Al2O3, Co2P/TiO2 and bimetallic NiCoP/TiO2 demonstrates the generality with which supported metal phosphides can be accessed in a safe and straightforward fashion with small sizes and high dispersion.

         <title>Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Silver Electrocatalysts for Selective and Stable Syngas Production from Reactive Carbon Capture Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a simple yet effect strategy to enhance CO selectivity and electrode stability using a titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayer and a chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA). This strategy is ideally suited for the direct electrolysis of reactive CO2 capture solution towards carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production.







Abstract
Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50&#8201;% at potentials more negative than &#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33&#8201;% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5&#8197;ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47&#8201;% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.

         <title>Tailoring d&#8211;p Orbital Hybridization to Decipher the Essential Effects of Heteroatom Substitution on Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The moderate&#8208;concentration Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 simultaneously with suitable Se vacancies adsorbing OH&#8722; (Co(M)&#8722;Ni3Se4(VM)&#8722;OH&#8722;) presents optimal d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, substantially deciphering the effects of Co atoms substitution on the fast redox kinetics and ultrahigh rate capability of Ni3Se4 cathodes.







Abstract
The heteroatom substitution is considered as a promising strategy for boosting the redox kinetics of transition metal compounds in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) although the dissimilar metal identification and essential mechanism that dominate the kinetics remain unclear. It is presented that d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal and electrolyte ions can be utilized as a descriptor for understanding the redox kinetics. Herein, a series of Co, Fe and Cu heteroatoms are respectively introduced into Ni3Se4 cathodes, among them, only the moderate Co&#8208;substituted Ni3Se4 can hold the optimal d&#8208;p orbital hybridization resulted from the formed more unoccupied antibonding states &#960;*. It inevitably enhances the interfacial charge transfer and ensures the balanced OH&#8722; adsorption&#8208;desorption to accelerate the redox kinetics validated by the lowest reaction barrier (0.59&#8197;eV, matching well with the theoretical calculations). Coupling with the lower OH&#8722; diffusion energy barrier, the prepared cathode delivers ultrahigh rate capability (~68.7&#8201;% capacity retention even the current density increases by 200&#8197;times), and an assembled HSC also presents high energy/power density. This work establishes the principles for determining heteroatoms and deciphers the underlying effects of the heteroatom substitution on improving redox kinetics and the rate performance of battery&#8208;type electrodes from a novel perspective of orbital&#8208;scale manipulation.

         <title>Unusual Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity in Oxidation of Pyrroles and Indoles Enabled by a Thianthrenium Salt Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
TTSO (thianthrene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide) in conjunction with TFAA (trifluoroacetic anhydride) and Br&#248;nsted acid is able to oxidize pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones via a thianthrenium salt intermediate. In the case of 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles, the product isomer formed is that in which oxygenation has been introduced at the more sterically hindered position.







Abstract
A dearomative oxidation of pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones is described, which employs a sulfoxide as oxidant, in conjunction with a carboxylic acid anhydride and a Br&#248;nsted acid additive. 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles undergo regioselective oxidation to give the product isomer in which oxygen has been introduced at the more hindered position. Regioselectivity is rationalized by a proposed mechanism that proceeds by initial thianthrenium introduction at the less&#8208;hindered pyrrole &#945;&#8208;position, followed by distal attack of an oxygen nucleophile and subsequent elimination of thianthrene. The same reaction conditions are also able to effect a chemoselective oxidation of indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and additionally of indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones to 2&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. Here again, the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities are rationalized through the intermediacy of a thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxidation of Alcohols in Gold&#8208;Coated Milling Vessels via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovating in selective alcohol oxidation, our study unveils a gold&#8208;catalyzed direct mechanocatalytic approach, boasting &gt;95&#8201;% aldehyde conversion with &lt;0.3&#8201;% overoxidation and minimal gold abrasion. Optimized parameters ensure efficiency and sustainability across alcohols, with high catalyst reusability. XPS surface analysis of the gold milling balls highlight the oxidation mechanism and its potential in green chemistry.







Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99&#8201;% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77&#8197;s&#8722;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

         <dc:description>
A series of pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) with different skeleton torsion&#8208;angles have been rationally prepared, which exhibits significant differences in its exciton behavior, reactive oxygen species, photocatalytic activity, and mechanisms. It provides a valuable reference and inspiration for the rational design of novel, high&#8208;efficiency, and high&#8208;selectivity CPPs photocatalysts.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in determining photocatalytic reaction pathways, intermediate species, and product selectivity. However, research on ROS regulation in polymer photocatalysts is still in its early stages. Herein, we successfully achieved series of modulations to the skeleton of Pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based (Tetraethynylpyrene (TEPY)) conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) by altering the linkers (1,4&#8208;dibromobenzene (BE), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (IP), and 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (BP)). Experiments combined with theoretical calculations indicate that BE&#8208;TEPY exhibits a planar structure with minimal exciton binding energy, which favors exciton dissociation followed by charge transfer with adsorbed O2 to produce &#8901;O2&#8722;. Thus BE&#8208;TEPY shows optimal photocatalytic activity for phenylboronic acid oxidation and [3+2] cycloaddition. Conversely, the skeleton of BP&#8208;TEPY is significantly distorted. Its planar conjugation decreases, intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency increases, which makes it more prone for resonance energy transfer to generate 1O2. Therefore, BP&#8208;TEPY displays best photocatalytic activity in [4+2] cycloaddition and thioanisole oxidation. Both above reactant conversion and its product selectivity exceed 99&#8201;%. This work systematically reveals the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationship among the skeleton structure of CPPs, excitonic behavior, and selective generation of ROS, providing new insights for the rational design of highly efficient and selective CPPs photocatalysts.

         <title>Role of Cu Oxide and Cu Adatoms in the Reactivity of CO2 on Cu(110)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With in situ near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the CuO/Cu(110) interface reacts with CO2 at room temperature, yielding the formation of Cu adatom&#8208;CO3 complexes. The reaction&#8208;induced surface structure resulting from CO2 exposes Cu adatoms and CuO segments as potential active sites on Cu(110), whose presence favor CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over sites on the bare Cu surface.







Abstract
We investigate the interaction of CO2 with metallic and oxidized Cu(110) surfaces using a combination of near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and theoretical calculations. While the Cu(110) and full CuO films are inert, the interface between bare Cu(110) and the CuO film is observed to react instantly with CO2 at a 10&#8197;mbar pressure. The reaction is observed to proceed from the interfacial sites of CuO/Cu(110). During reaction with CO2, the CuO/Cu(110) interface releases Cu adatoms which combine with CO3 to produce a variety of added Cu&#8722;CO3 structures, whose stability depends on the gas pressure of CO2. A main implication for the reactivity of Cu(110) is that Cu adatoms and highly undercoordinated CuO segments are created on the Cu(110) surface through the interaction with CO2, which may act as reaction&#8208;induced active sites. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, our theoretical assessment of such sites indicates that their presence may significantly promote CH3OH formation. Our study thus implies that the CuO/Cu(110) interfacial system is highly dynamic in the presence of CO2, and it suggests a possible strong importance of reaction&#8208;induced Cu and CuO sites for the surface chemistry of Cu(110) in CO2&#8208;related catalysis.

         <title>Merged Molecular Switches Excel as Optoacoustic Dyes: Azobenzene&#8211;Cyanines Are Loud and Photostable NIR Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic dyes used in photoacoustic imaging are often photobleachable and hard to quantify as they respond nonlinearly to excitation intensity. However, a systematic method that uses molecular switches to shorten their nonradiative decay times to 4&#8197;ps converts them into reliably quantifiable linear absorbers that are up to &gt;1000&#8208;fold more photostable and several times better signal generators in photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Optoacoustic (or photoacoustic) imaging promises micron&#8208;resolution noninvasive bioimaging with much deeper penetration (&gt;cm) than fluorescence. However, optoacoustic imaging of enzyme activity would require loud, photostable, NIR&#8208;absorbing molecular contrast agents, which remain unknown. Most organic molecular contrast agents are repurposed fluorophores, with severe shortcomings of photoinstability or phototoxicity under optoacoustic imaging, as consequences of their slow S1&#8594;S0 electronic relaxation. We now report that known fluorophores can be rationally modified to reach ultrafast S1&#8594;S0 rates, without much extra molecular complexity, simply by merging them with molecular switches. Here, we merge azobenzene switches with cyanine dyes to give ultrafast relaxation (&lt;10&#8197;ps, &gt;100&#8208;fold faster). Without even adapting instrument settings, these azohemicyanines display outstanding improvements in signal longevity (&gt;1000&#8208;fold increase of photostability) and signal loudness (&gt;3&#8208;fold even at time zero). We show why this simple but unexplored design strategy can still offer stronger performance in the future, and can also increase the spatial resolution and the quantitative linearity of photoacoustic response over extended longitudinal imaging. By bringing the world of molecular switches and rotors to bear on problems facing optoacoustic agents, this practical strategy will help to unleash the full potential of optoacoustic imaging in fundamental studies and translational uses.

         <title>Amorphous MnRuOx Containing Microcrystalline for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal amorphous MnRuOx and RuO2 crystalline heterostructures are critical in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the acidic OER. The microcrystalline regions in the catalyst serve as a supporting framework, while the amorphous phase fills the microcrystalline interstices, thus providing substantial defects and active sites at the interfaces to facilitate efficient adsorption/conversion of OH&#8722; and charge transfer.







Abstract
Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8722;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8211;Active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We inserted Mn dopants in Co4N, to promote the formation of high&#8208;valence Co4+ during the pre&#8208;catalyst activation process. The energy barrier of phase transformation from CoOOH to CoO2 was lowered by introducing J&#8211;T active Mn3+ cations, because the violent distortion of the Mn3+ (t32ge1g)&#8208;centered octahedra MnO6 reduces the structural stability, and facilitates the H desorption. The consistent relationship between the J&#8211;T dopants and the deep&#8208;oxidation process is proved, and this concept can be extended to other elements. Moreover, the lattice oxygen in Mn doped CoO2 (Mn&#8208;CoO2) is activated to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the direct formation of oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (

) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn&#8208;doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8211;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of the catalyst's electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.

         <title>Force Transduction Through Distant Force&#8208;Bearing Regioisomeric Linkages Affects the Mechanochemical Reactivity of Cyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the p&#8208;position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force&#8208;bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.

         <title>Chromium Catalyzed Asymmetric Reformatsky Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Cr&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction of aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;chlorinated esters and amides has been developed, providing modular access to valuable chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
This study describes an unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction, enabling the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;&#8208;chlorinated or &#945;&#8208;brominated esters and amides. By employing a chiral chromium/diarylamine bis(oxazoline) catalyst, we achieved relatively broad functional group tolerance. Distinct from known reports, the protocol operates under both classical and photoredox conditions, facilitated by the in situ formation of a nucleophilic chiral chromium intermediate through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, identify the nucleophilic aldehyde addition as the key stereo&#8208;determining step. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of existing Reformatsky reactions but also provides a versatile strategy for accessing complex chiral molecules.

         <title>20.1&#8201;% Certified Efficiency of Planar Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells by Spacer Cation Chain Length Engineering of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cation is proposed to achieve systematic control of key properties of 2D perovskite in 3D/2D perovskite heterojunctions. The 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium spacer cations realizes the optimal balance between defect passivation, energy level structure, and charge transport. The planar hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.40&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar triple&#8208;layer hole transport layer (HTL)&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have outstanding advantages of low cost and high stability, but are limited by low efficiency. The formation of a 3D/2D heterojunction has been widely proven to enhance device performance. However, the 2D perovskite possesses multiple critical properties associated with 3D perovskite, including defect passivation, energy level, and charge transport properties, all of which can impact device performance. It is challenging to find a powerful means to achieve comprehensive regulation and trade&#8208;off of these key properties. Herein, we propose a chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cations to achieve this goal. The results show that the 2D perovskite formed by short&#8208;chain alkylammonium cations primarily acts to passivate defects. With the increase in cation chain length, the 2D perovskite achieves a more matched energy level with 3D perovskite, enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and promoting charge separation. However, the further increase in chain length impedes the charge transport due to the insulativity of organic cations. Comprehensively, the 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium cations achieves the optimal balance of defect passivation, interface charge separation, and charge transport. The planar HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs exhibit a new record efficiency of 20.40&#8201;% (certified 20.1&#8201;%).

         <title>Re&#8208;Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is presented to dissect fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases into &#8220;splitting unit&#8221; pairs (SUPs). Collaboration in SUPs is facilitated by artificial duplication of the thiolation domain and its linkers, and an optimized split site. The productivities of SUPs match or exceed those of the corresponding single&#8208;subunit chimeras or even those of native fungal enzymes, boding well for generating novel peptide natural product analogues.







Abstract
Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules. Functional collaboration between the subunits is then facilitated by artificially duplicating, at the N&#8208;terminus of the downstream subunit, the linker &#8208; thiolation domain &#8208; linker fragment that is resident at the C&#8208;terminus of the upstream subunit. Using the suggested split site that follows a conserved motif in the linker connecting the adenylation and the thiolation domains allows cognate or chimeric splitting unit pairs to achieve productivities that match, and in many cases surpass those of hybrid chimeric enzymes, and even those of intact NRPSs, upon production in a heterologous chassis. Our strategy provides facile options for the rational engineering of fungal NRPSs and for the combinatorial reprogramming of nonribosomal peptide production.

         <title>Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the odilorhabdin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was elucidated by engineering of the central non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Therefore, specific modules of the odilorhabdin synthetase were assembled to well&#8208;studied NRPS systems, which resulted in small and non&#8208;toxic NRPS test systems. This method enabled an in vivo investigation of the biosynthesis of targeted NRPS modules and accessory genes of the BGC in E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
The recently identified natural product NOSO&#8208;95A from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO&#8208;502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood.

     alt="Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biosynthesis of the odilorhabdin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was elucidated by engineering of the central non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Therefore, specific modules of the odilorhabdin synthetase were assembled to well-studied NRPS systems, which resulted in small and non-toxic NRPS test systems. This method enabled an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; investigation of the biosynthesis of targeted NRPS modules and accessory genes of the BGC in &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently identified natural product NOSO-95A from entomopathogenic &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO-502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO-95A in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co-expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug-activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Xanthene&#8208;backbone FLPs featuring secondary borane functions &#8722;B(ArX)H (where ArX=C6F5 (ArF) or C6Cl5 (ArCl)) have been targeted through reactions of the dihydroboranes Me2S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BArXH2 with [4,5&#8208;xanth(PR2)Li]2 (R=Ph, iPr), and investigated in the synthesis of related cationic systems via hydride abstraction. The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8722;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four&#8208;coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8722;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N&#8208;to&#8208;P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]&#8722; conjugate base through N&#8208;to&#8208;B &#960; bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B&#8208;bound ArX group. It is viable in the case of C6F5 substituents, but is prevented by the more sterically encumbering and secondary donor&#8208;stabilising capabilities of the C6Cl5 substituent.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient PEC strategy is developed to produce urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; over a cubic Cu2O photocathode, achieving high formation rate (29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Faraday efficiency (12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;%) of urea. Experimental and theoretical data demonstrate the reaction mechanism, showing the key intermediates and details of C&#8722;N couplings.







Abstract
Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;% at low external potential (&#8722;0.017&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.

         <title>Roles of Ferric Peroxide Anion Intermediates (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) in Cytochrome P450 19A1 Steroid Aromatization and a Cytochrome P450 2B4 Secosteroid Oxidation Model</title>

         <dc:description>
Although most cytochrome P450&#8208;catalyzed oxidations are believed to utilize perferryl oxygen (Compound I) as a reactive iron species, the ferric peroxide species (Compound 0) is thought to catalyze some oxidative deformylations. This study revealed the dominant contribution of Compound 0 in the P450 19A1&#8208;catalyzed steroid aromatization and P450 2B4&#8208;catalyzed model aromatization reactions, utilizing deuterium and 18O labeling approaches.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) 19A1 is the steroid aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the 3&#8208;step conversion of androgens (androstenedione or testosterone) to estrogens. The final step is C&#8722;C bond scission (removing the 19&#8208;oxo group as formic acid) that proceeds via a historically controversial reaction mechanism. The two competing mechanistic possibilities involve a ferric peroxide anion (Fe3+O2&#8722;, Compound 0) and a perferryl oxy species (FeO3+, Compound I). One approach to discern the role of each species in the reaction is with the use of oxygen&#8208;18 labeling, i.e., from 18O2 and H218O of the reaction product formic acid. We applied this approach, using several technical improvements, to study the deformylation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione by human P450 19A1 and of a model secosteroid, 3&#8208;oxodecaline&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;10&#8208;carboxaldehyde (ODEC), by rabbit P450 2B4. Both aldehyde substrates were sensitive to non&#8208;enzymatic acid&#8208;catalyzed deformylation, yielding 19&#8208;norsteroids, and conditions were established to avoid issues with artifactual generation of formic acid. The Compound 0 reaction pathway predominated (i.e., Fe3+O2&#8722;) in both P450 19A1 oxidation of 19&#8208;oxo&#8208;androstenedione and P450 2B4 oxidation of ODEC. The P450 19A1 results contrast with our prior conclusions (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 15016&#8211;16025), attributed to several technical modifications.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Covalent C=C/C=N Metathesis Reaction for Associative Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the C=C/C=N metathesis reaction, we have successfully incorporated tunable plasticity into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating catalyst&#8208;free and associative covalent adaptable networks with superior thermal and mechanical properties. The rapid exchange of C=C/C=N bonds significantly accelerates stress relaxation, enhancing malleability and enabling recovery under mild conditions. This plasticity also led to advanced shape memory properties with complex 3D permanent shapes.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), leveraging the dynamic exchange of covalent bonds, emerge as a promising material to address the challenge of irreversible cross&#8208;linking in thermosetting polymers. In this work, we explore the introduction of a catalyst&#8208;free and associative C=C/C=N metathesis reaction into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating CANs with superior stability, solvent resistance, and thermal/mechanical properties. By incorporating this dynamic exchange reaction, stress&#8208;relaxation is significantly accelerated compared to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;only networks, with the rate adjustable by modifying substituents in the ortho position of the dynamic double bonds. The obtained plasticity enables recycle without altering the chemical structure or mechanical properties, and is also found to be vital for achieving shape memory functions with complex spatial structures. This metathesis reaction as a new dynamic crosslinker of polymer networks has the potential to accelerate the ongoing exploration of malleable and functional thermoset polymers.

         <title>Enzymes in Synergy: Bacteria Specific Molecular Probe for Locoregional Imaging of Urinary Tract Infection in vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>

We developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared uropathogenic E. coli (UPECs) peptide fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs via the collaborative response of bacterial enzymes (OmpT and APN), enabling locoregional imaging of urinary tract infections both in vitro and in vivo, opening new avenues for timely and precise UTI diagnosis.







Abstract
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPECs) is a leading cause for urinary tract infections (UTI), accounting for 70&#8211;90&#8201;% of community or hospital&#8208;acquired bacterial infections owing to high recurrence, imprecision in diagnosis and management, and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Current methods for clinical UPECs detection still rely on labor&#8208;intensive urine cultures that impede rapid and accurate diagnosis for timely UTI therapeutic management. Herein, we developed a first&#8208;in&#8208;class near&#8208;infrared (NIR) UPECs fluorescent probe (NO&#8722;AH) capable of specifically targeting UPECs through its collaborative response to bacterial enzymes, enabling locoregional imaging of UTIs both in vitro and in vivo. Our NO&#8722;AH probe incorporates a dual protease activatable moiety, which first reacts with OmpT, an endopeptidase abundantly present on the outer membrane of UPECs, releasing an intermediate amino acid residue conjugated with a NIR hemicyanine fluorophore. Such liberated fragment would be subsequently recognized by aminopeptidase (APN) within the periplasm of UPECs, activating localized fluorescence for precise imaging of UTIs in complex living environments. The peculiar specificity and selectivity of NO&#8722;AH, facilitated by the collaborative action of bacterial enzymes, features a timely and accurate identification of UPECs&#8208;infected UTIs, which could overcome misdiagnosis in conventional urine tests, thus opening new avenues towards reliable UTI diagnosis and personalized antimicrobial therapy management.

         <title>Biomimetic Charge&#8208;Neutral Anion Receptors for Reversible Binding and Release of Highly Hydrated Phosphate in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic charge&#8208;neutral anion receptor for reversible binding and release of highly hydrated phosphate in water is reported.







Abstract
Control of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8722;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1&#8211;L4), which were equipped with morpholine and polyethylene glycol terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8722; anion in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100&#8201;% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100&#8201;% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Thiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes occur under silyl catalysis to generate sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts. Conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when optically&#8208;enriched epoxide was used. A desulfurizing transformation provides functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks. DFT calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these cycloadditions.







Abstract
Unexpectedly facile dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy enolsilanes, providing sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts, are reported. A total of fifteen thiophene substrates have been found to undergo (4+3) cycloaddition smoothly to produce endo and exo (4+3) adducts in yields of up to 83&#8201;% with moderate to good diastereoselectivity. Complete conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when the optically enriched epoxide was used. The desulfurizing transformations of the sulfur&#8208;bridged skeleton of the cycloadducts provide functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks consisting of 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadiene subunits. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these (4+3) cycloadditions.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 Using a Dual&#8208;Sites Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework Coupled with Cu2O Nanoparticles via a Synergetic&#8208;Tandem Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy was developed to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst by dispersing Cu2O nanoparticles on CuPOF&#8208;Bpy@CNT comprising dual active sites for CO2 electroreduction. The synergetic interaction in dual active sites efficiently reduces CO2 to *CO with high concentration, which transferred to the nearby Cu2O sites for *CO dimerization to form *COCOH, affording an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 71&#8201;% for C2H4 production.







Abstract
Low *CO coverage on the active sites is a major hurdle in the tandem electrocatalysis, resulting in unsatisfied C2H4 production efficiencies. In this work, we developed a synergetic&#8208;tandem strategy to construct a copper&#8208;based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4, which was constructed via the template&#8208;directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu2O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8722;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu2O nanoparticles for further C2H4 production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FEC2H4) of 71.0&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper&#8208;based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.

The synergetic interaction in dual active sites efficiently reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to *CO with high concentration, which transferred to the nearby Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O sites for *CO dimerization to form *COCOH, affording an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 71&#8201;% for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low *CO coverage on the active sites is a major hurdle in the tandem electrocatalysis, resulting in unsatisfied C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiencies. In this work, we developed a synergetic-tandem strategy to construct a copper-based composite catalyst for the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which was constructed via the template-directed polymerization of ultrathin Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework incorporating atomically isolated Cu(II) porphyrin and Cu(II) bipyridine sites on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, and then Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on the CNT scaffold. The presence of dual active sites within the Cu(II) porphyrin organic framework create a synergetic effect, leading to an increase in local *CO availability to enhance the C&#8722;C coupling step implemented on the adjacent Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanoparticles for further C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production. Accordingly, the resultant catalyst affords an exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;C2H4&lt;/sub&gt;) of 71.0&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), making it one of the most effective copper-based tandem catalysts reported to date. The superior performance of the catalyst is further confirmed through operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs. The optimized ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions, provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.







Abstract
One&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures (C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) can greatly reduce the energy consumption of the separation process, but it is extremely challenging. Herein, we use crystal engineering and reticular chemistry to introduce unsaturated bonds (ethynyl and alkyne) into ligands, and successfully design and synthesized two novel Zr&#8208;MOCs (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne). The introduction of carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds provides abundant adsorption sites within the framework while modulating the pore window size. Comprehensive characterization techniques including single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) confirm that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;alkyne possess an isostructural framework with ZrT&#8208;1 and ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;Me, respectively. Adsorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can effectively remove trace C2H2 and C2H6 in C2H4 and achieve separation of C2H2 from C2H4 and CO2. ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;ethenyl can also directly purify C2H4 in liquid solutions. This work provides a benchmark for MOCs that one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Catalysed n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is introduced by using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles with alkylthiolated species (f&#8208;AuNPs) as a catalyst, which is activated at temperatures~70&#8201;&#176;C. This method ensures stables semiconductor+dopant+catalyst formulations and films but enables, upon mild heating, rapid and efficient n&#8208;doping as well as high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is reported using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles (f&#8208;AuNPs) with alkylthiols acting as the catalyst only upon mild thermal activation. To demonstrate the versatility of this methodology, the reaction of the n&#8208;type dopant precursor N&#8208;DMBI&#8208;H with several molecular and polymeric semiconductors at different temperatures with/without f&#8208;AuNPs, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the unfunctionalized catalyst AuNPs, was investigated by spectroscopic, morphological, charge transport, and kinetic measurements as well as, computationally, the thermodynamic of catalyst activation. The combined experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that while f&#8208;AuNPs is inactive at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state, catalyst activation occurs rapidly at mild temperatures (~70&#8201;&#176;C) and the doping reaction completes in few seconds affording large electrical conductivities (~10&#8211;140&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The implementation of this methodology enables the use of semiconductor+dopant+catalyst solutions and will broaden the use of the corresponding n&#8208;doped films in opto&#8208;electronic devices such as thin&#8208;film transistors, electrochemical transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectrics well as guide the design of new catalysts.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship of p&#8208;block Bi element for selectivity CH4 was found. The CH4 selectivity of the p&#8208;block Bi element is also positively correlated with adsorption energy of *CHO. Further analysis indicates that the interaction in VO/Bi heterosites on Bi2MoO6 enhances the absorption and activation of *CHO, facilitates the *CO&#8208;*CHO process, and enriches carriers at the active site for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion.







Abstract
Selective photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels, such as CH4, is highly desirable due to its high mass&#8208;energy density. Nevertheless, achieving selective CH4 with higher production yield on p&#8208;block materials is hindered by non&#8208;ideal adsorption of *CHO key intermediate and an unclear structure&#8208;function relationship. Herein, we unlock the key reaction steps of CO2 and found a volcano&#8208;type structure&#8208;function relationship for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion by gradual reduction of the p&#8208;band center of the p&#8208;block Bi element leading to formation of Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites. The selectivity of CH4 is also positive correlation with adsorption energy of *CHO. The Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites with an appropriate filled Bi&#8208;6p orbital electrons and p band center (&#8722;0.64) enhance the coupling between C&#8208;2p of *CHO and Bi&#8208;6p orbitals, thereby resulting in high selectivity (95.2&#8201;%) and productivity (17.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) towards CH4. Further studies indicate that the synergistic effect between Bi&#8208;oxygen vacancy heterosites reduces Gibbs free energy for *CO&#8208;*CHO process, activates the C&#8722;H and C=O bonds of *CHO, and facilitates the enrichment of photoexcited electrons at active sites for multielectron photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion. This work provides a new perspective on developing p&#8208;block elements for selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Alloy&#8208;Doped SEI Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and High&#8208;Rate Li Metal Anode</title>

The electron&#8208;donating feature of the spontaneously formed Li&#8722;Au alloy promotes the directional decomposition of LiTFSI to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped composite functional SEI layer, which is more conducive to the rapid and uniform transport of Li ions, and a high&#8208;rate dendrite&#8208;free stable anode interface was obtained.







Abstract
Li metal is regarded as the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; in the next generation of anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, sluggish Li ions interfacial transport kinetics and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth limit practical application of the energy storage system in high&#8208;power device. Herein, separators are modified by the addition of a coating, which spontaneously grafts onto the Li anode interface for in situ lithiation. The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron&#8208;donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high&#8208;power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 8000&#8197;h (20,000&#8197;cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra&#8208;high currents (40&#8197;C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68&#8197;s to provide high capacity of 151&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode.

         <title>Interfacial Domino Effect Triggered by &#946;&#8208;Alanine Cations Realized Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;ionized Ala+ cations trigger a domino effect after electrostatic adsorption at IHP. The electrostatic shielding regulates crystal energetic preference and realizes crystallographic optimization. The moderative electro&#8208;reduction kinetics caused by the adsorbed Ala+ realize the balance between interfacial consumption rate of Zn2+ ions and mass transfer rate, restrains the formation of concentration polarization and anion&#8208;depleted boundary.







Abstract
Realizing durative dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and no by&#8208;product deposition configuration on Zn anodes is crucial to solving the short circuit and premature failure of batteries, which is simultaneously determined by the Zn interface chemistry, electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, mass transfer process, and their interaction. Herein, this work unmasks a domino effect of the &#946;&#8208;alanine cations (Ala+) within the hydrogel matrix, which effectively triggers the subsequent electrostatic shielding and beneficial knock&#8208;on effects via the specifical adsorption earliest event on the Zn anode surface. The electrostatic shielding effect regulates the crystallographic energetic preference of Zn deposits and retards fast electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, thereby steering stacked stockier block morphology and realizing crystallographic optimization. Meanwhile, the mass transfer rate of Zn2+ ions was accelerated via the SO42&#8722; anion immobilized caused by Ala+ in bulk electrolyte, finally bringing the balance between electroreduction kinetics and mass transfer process, which enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition behavior. Concomitantly, the interfacial adsorbed Ala+ cations facilitate the electrochemical reduction of interfacial SO42&#8722; anions to form the inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase layer. The above domino effects immensely improve the utilization efficiency of Zn anodes and long&#8208;term stability, as demonstrated by the 12&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn cells (3650&#8197;h) and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.4&#8201;%).

         <title>Anisotropic Dual S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Mimic Natural Photosynthetic System for Boosting Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative biomimetic artificial photosynthetic system for the first time. The anisotropic migration of BiOBr carriers demonstrates exceptional charge pre&#8208;separation properties, effectively mimicking the role of electron transport chain observed in natural photosynthesis. The incorporation of a stepped dual S&#8208;Scheme band structure ensures the optimal simulation of the photosystem (PSII/PSI).







Abstract
The design of heterojunctions that mimic natural photosynthetic systems holds great promise for enhancing photoelectric response. However, the limited interfacial space charge layer (SCL) often fails to provide sufficient driving force for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Drawing inspiration from the electron transport chain (ETC) in natural photosynthesis system, we developed a novel anisotropic dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction artificial photosynthetic system composed of Bi2O3&#8722;BiOBr&#8722;AgI for the first time, with Bi2O3 and AgI selectively distributed along the bicrystal facets of BiOBr. Compared to traditional semiconductors, the anisotropic carrier migration in BiOBr overcomes the recombination resulting from thermodynamic diffusion, thereby establishing a potential ETC for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Importantly, this pioneering bioinspired design overcomes the limitations imposed by the limited distribution of SCL in heterojunctions, resulting in a remarkable 55&#8208;fold enhancement in photoelectric performance. Leveraging the etching of thiols on Ag&#8208;based materials, this dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is further employed in the construction of photoelectrochemical sensors for the detection of acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus pesticides.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Plastic and Biomass&#8208;Derived Polyols to Formamide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrocatalytic strategy to upgrade plastic and biomass to formamide in the presence of NH3 over a WO3 catalyst under ambient conditions. Facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, the C&#8722;C bond in PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and biomass&#8208;derived polyols were effectively cleaved with C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of wasted plastic and renewable biomass represents a sustainable method to produce chemicals but is limited to carbohydrates, leaving other value&#8208;added chemicals, such as organonitrogen compounds, being scarcely explored. Herein, we reported an electrocatalytic oxidation strategy to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) and biomass&#8208;derived polyols into formamide, in the presence of ammonia (NH3) over a tungsten oxide (WO3) catalyst. Taking EG&#8208;to&#8208;formamide as an example, we achieved a high formamide productivity of 537.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with FE of 43.2&#8201;% at a constant current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow electrolyzer with 12&#8208;h test, representing a more advantageous performance compared with previous reports for formamide electrosynthesis. Mechanistic understanding revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the EG was facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, with resultant C&#8722;N bond construction and eventually formamide production. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to transformation of PET bottle and a series of biomass&#8208;derived polyols with carbon number from three (glycerol) to six (glucose), producing formamide with high efficiencies. This work demonstrates a sustainable upgrading strategy of plastic and biomass that may have implications to more value&#8208;added chemicals production beyond carbohydrates.

         <title>SERS Detection of Trace Carcinogenic Aromatic Amines Based on Amorphous MoO3 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers exhibit high SERS performance due to the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic effect. It is capable of trace detection and identification of carcinogenic aromatic amines with good uniformity, acid resistance and thermal stability, which is of great significance for reducing cancer risk.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are important commercial chemicals, but their carcinogenicity poses a threat to humans and other organisms, making their rapid quantitative detection increasingly urgent. Here, amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible region are designed for the trace detection of carcinogenic aromatic amine molecules. The hot&#8208;electron fast decay component of a&#8208;MoO3 decreases from 301&#8197;fs to 150&#8197;fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon&#8208;induced hot&#8208;electron transfer (PIHET) process from a&#8208;MoO3 to MO. Therefore, a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers present high SERS performance due to the synergistic effect of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and PIHET, proposing the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic mechanism in a&#8208;MoO3. In addition, a&#8208;MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c&#8208;MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o&#8208;aminoazotoluene (o&#8208;AAT) is 10&#8722;9&#8197;M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.

         <title>Super Hydrous Solvated Structure of Chaotropic Ca2+ Contributes Superior Anti&#8208;Freezing Aqueous Electrolytes and Stabilizes the Zn anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure is proposed to solve the problem of low temperature poor performance and Zn anode instability for AZIBs. Based on the Hofmeister series, the addition of chaotropic Ca2+ forms an eight&#8208;coordination solvation, which breaks the HBs between water molecules and results in a water&#8208;poor solvation of Zn2+. Zn||PTO batteries display excellent cycling stability and rate performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The further development of aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is constrained by the high freezing points and the instability on Zn anodes. Current improvement strategies mainly focus on regulating hydrogen bond (HB) donors (H) of solvent water to disrupt HBs, while neglecting the environment of HB&#8208;acceptors (O). Herein, we propose a mechanism of chaotropic cation&#8208;regulated HB&#8208;acceptor via a &#8220;super hydrous solvated&#8221; structure. Chaotropic Ca2+ can form a solvated structure via competitively binding O atoms in H2O, effectively breaking the HBs among H2O molecules, thereby reducing the glass transition temperature of hybrid 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 (M) ZnCl2+4&#8197;M CaCl2 electrolyte (&#8722;113.2&#8201;&#176;C). Meanwhile, the high hydratability of Ca2+ contributes to the water&#8208;poor solvated structure of Zn2+, suppressing side reactions and uneven Zn deposition. Benefiting from the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte and high reversible Zn anode, the Zn||Pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 183.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 1600&#8208;time stable cycling at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a cheap and efficient aqueous electrolyte to simultaneously improve low&#8208;temperature performances and Zn stability, broadening the design concepts for antifreeze electrolytes.

         <title>Selective Increase in CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Activity at Nanograin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich Mixed Cu(I)/Cu(0) Sites via Enriching Co&#8208;Adsorbed CO and Hydroxyl Species</title>

         <dc:description>
The ethylene generation pathway is usually thermodynamically preferred due to its lower activation energy barrier relative to ethanol product. Herein, we showed a method to high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion by enhancing the co&#8208;adsorption of *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species over a Cu2O&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured boundaries.







Abstract
Selective producing ethanol from CO2 electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion (53.5&#8201;% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured grain&#8208;boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2&#8201;% energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor. In situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis identified that these dualphase Cu(I) and Cu(0) sites stabilized by grain&#8208;boundaries are very robust over the operating potential window, which maintains a high concentration of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of *OHad not only promote the easier dimerization of *CO to form *OCCO (&#916;G~0.20&#8197;eV) at low overpotentials but also preferentially favor the key *CHCOH intermediate hydrogenation to *CHCHOH (ethanol pathway) while suppressing its dehydration to *CCH (ethylene pathway), which is believed to determine the remarkable ethanol selectivity. Such imperative intermediates associated with the bifurcation pathway were directly distinguished by isotope labelling in situ infrared spectroscopy. Our work promotes the understanding of bifurcating mechanism of CO2ER&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons more deeply, providing a feasible strategy for the design of efficient ethanol&#8208;targeted catalysts.

         <title>Digital Light Processing to Afford High Resolution and Degradable CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiol&#8208;ene based 3D printing of a low molar mass CO2&#8208; and bio&#8208;derived ABA triblock copolymer through digital light processing is reported. A series of sustainable elastomers are produced with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker lengths and poly(ethylene glycol) content to print complex geometries at high resolution. The materials display printing induced phase separation, tunable hydrophilicity, and complete hydrolytic degradation.







Abstract
Vat photopolymerization 3D printing has proven very successful for the rapid additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric parts at high resolution. However, the range of materials that can be printed and their resulting properties remains narrow. Herein, we report the successful AM of a series of poly(carbonate&#8208;b&#8208;ester&#8208;b&#8208;carbonate) elastomers, derived from carbon dioxide and bio&#8208;derived &#1013;&#8208;decalactone. By employing a highly active and selective Co(II)Mg(II) polymerization catalyst, an ABA triblock copolymer (Mn=6.3&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, &#208;M=1.26) was synthesized, formulated into resins which were 3D printed using digital light processing (DLP) and a thiol&#8208;ene&#8208;based crosslinking system. A series of elastomeric and degradable thermosets were produced, with varying thiol cross&#8208;linker length and poly(ethylene glycol) content, to produce complex triply periodic geometries at high resolution. Thermomechanical characterization of the materials reveals printing&#8208;induced microphase separation and tunable hydrophilicity. These findings highlight how utilizing DLP can produce sustainable materials from low molar mass polyols quickly and at high resolution. The 3D printing of these functional materials may help to expedite the production of sustainable plastics and elastomers with potential to replace conventional petrochemical&#8208;based options.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atom Sites with the Irving&#8211;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to engineer single&#8208;atom sites from d5 to d10, the Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the highest stability and fastest charge&#8208;transfer efficiency. As predicted, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits a higher activity towards the photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs.







Abstract
The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8211;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8211;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8722; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8211;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.

         <title>Synthesis of All&#8208;Benzene Multi&#8208;Macrocyclic Nanocarbons by Post&#8208;Functionalization of meta&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;functionalization approach of meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes has been successfully established as a key to access topologically diverse, all&#8208;benzene multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons. Employing iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation followed by inter&#8208; and intramolecular C&#8722;C couplings, this approach enables the divergent and facile synthesis of novel all&#8208;benzene structural types including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane.







Abstract
Expanding the diversity of multi&#8208;macrocyclic nanocarbons, particularly those with all&#8208;benzene scaffolds, represents intriguing yet challenging synthetic tasks. Complementary to the existing synthetic approaches, here we report an efficient and modular post&#8208;functionalization strategy that employs iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation of the highly strained meta&#8208;cycloparaphenylenes (mCPPs) and an mCPP&#8208;derived catenane. Based on the functionalized macrocyclic synthons, a number of novel all&#8208;benzene topological structures including linear and cyclic chains, polycatenane, and pretzelane have been successfully prepared and characterized, thereby showcasing the synthetic utility and potential of the post&#8208;functionalization strategy.

Insights into the oxygen&#8208;stable state of the H&#8208;cluster are revealed. Terminal Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context, demonstrate a striking structural resemblance to the enzymatic Hinact state. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, and labile and kinetically controlled binding of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group.







Abstract
[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of these enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron center bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to the advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and the integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Generation from Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis on a Tandem Ruthenium&#8211;Platinum&#8211;Titanium Catalyst</title>

The RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site is utilized to investigate the activation pathways of hydrogen atoms during AB hydrolysis. RuPt&#8722;Ti exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity with a high TOF of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1, outperforming most noble metals.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) involves multiple undefined steps and complex adsorption and activation, so single or dual sites are not enough to rapidly achieve the multi&#8208;step catalytic processes. Designing multi&#8208;site catalysts is necessary to enhance the catalytic performance of AB hydrolysis reactions but revealing the matching reaction mechanisms of AB hydrolysis is a great challenge. In this work, we propose to construct RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts to clarify the multi&#8208;site tandem activation mechanism of AB hydrolysis. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi&#8208;site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H2 on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single&#8208;site Ru, dual&#8208;site RuPt and Ru&#8722;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi&#8208;site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low&#8208;carbon, and high&#8208;performance hydrogen production systems.

Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi-site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8722;Ti multi-site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency &lt;i&gt;(TOF)&lt;/i&gt; of 1293&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single-site Ru, dual-site RuPt and Ru&#8722;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi-site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low-carbon, and high-performance hydrogen production systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Backbone Editing for Controlled Degradation of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrocarbon backbone of vinyl polymers can be edited by mechanical force to achieve controlled degradation, wherein the cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide comonomer can be incorporated into the backbone of vinyl polymers through a photo&#8208;iniferter RAFT copolymerization pathway. The key aspect is that the cyclobutane units preserve the integrity of the polymer backbone during material application, while the cleavable imide groups can be selectively exposed through backbone editing upon mechanochemical activation. Subsequent hydrolysis of the imides facilitates efficient degradation and upcycling, resulting in the production of telechelic oligomers. This research holds the potential to inspire the design and modification of vinyl polymers through backbone editing.







Abstract
The chemically inert nature of fully saturated hydrocarbon backbones endows vinyl polymers with desirable durability, but it also leads to their significant environmental persistence. Enhancing the sustainability of these materials requires a pivotal yet challenging shift: transforming the inert backbone into one that is degradable. Here, we present a versatile platform for mechanochemically editing the fully saturated backbone of vinyl polymers towards degradable polymer chains by integrating cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide (CBS) units along backbone through photo&#8208;iniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) copolymerization. Significantly, the evenly insertion of CBS units does not compromise thermal or chemical stability but rather offers a means to adjust the properties of polymethylacrylate (PMA). Meanwhile, reactive acyclic imide units can be selectively introduced to the backbone through mechanochemical activation (pulse ultrasonication or ball&#8208;milling grinding) when required. Subsequent hydrolysis of the acyclic imide groups enables efficient degradation, yielding telechelic oligomers. This approach holds promise for inspiring the design and modification of more environmentally friendly vinyl polymers through backbone editing.

         <title>Lithium Borate Polycarbonates for High&#8208;Capacity Solid&#8208;State Composite Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
More elastic, softer, lithium borate substituted polycarbonates show higher ionic conductivity than counterparts with more rigid structures. These leading polymers are used as binders in composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich cathode, sulfide solid electrolyte and carbon. The cells show higher capacity and excellent retention of capacity over 300&#8197;charge/discharge cycles at a commercially realistic 1&#8197;MPa applied pressure.







Abstract
Improving composite cathode function is key to the success of the solid&#8208;state battery. Maximizing attainable cathode capacity and retention requires integrating suitable polymeric binders that retain a sufficiently high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term chemo&#8208;mechanical stability of the cathode active material&#8208;solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;carbon mixture. Herein, we report block copolymer networks composed of lithium borate polycarbonates and poly(ethylene oxide) that improved the capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and capacity retention (94&#8201;% over 300&#8197;cycles) of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode active material, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and carbon. Tetrahedral B(OR)2(OH)2&#8722; anions immobilized on the polycarbonate segments provide hydrogen&#8208;bonding chain crosslinking and selective Li&#8208;counterion conductivity, parameterized by Li&#8208;ion transference numbers close to unity (tLi+~0.94). With 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% polycarbonate content and a flexible low glass transition temperature backbone, the single&#8208;ion conductors achieved high Li&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The work should inform future binder design for improving the processability of cathode composites towards commercializing solid&#8208;state batteries, and allow use in other cell configurations, such as lithium&#8208;sulphur cathode designs.

         <title>Shape Shifting and Locking in Mechanically Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials for Thermoelastic Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>

Thermoelastic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy=2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) undergo two phase transitions at 310&#8197;K and 380&#8197;K. When heated to 380&#8197;K, the crystals show shape shifting and expand along the b&#8208;axis by about 13.4&#8201;%, corresponding to a larger deformation than that of thermally activated shape memory alloys (8.5&#8201;%), and exhibits a strong actuation force. During cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreases to 305&#8197;K.







Abstract
The construction of mechanically responsive materials with reversible shape&#8208;shifting, shape&#8208;locking, and stretchability holds promise for a wide range of applications in fields such as soft robotics and flexible electronics. Here, we report novel thermoelastic one&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (R/S&#8208;Hmpy)PbI3 (Hmpy=2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;pyrrolidinium) to show mechanical responses. The single crystals undergo two phase transitions at 310&#8197;K and 380&#8197;K.

During the cooling process, the stretched crystal shape maintains and a shape&#8208;locking phenomenon occurs, which is lifted when the temperature decreases to 305&#8197;K. Meanwhile, due to the introduction of chiral ions, the thermal switching shows a 10&#8208;fold second&#8208;order nonlinear switching contrast (common values typically below 3&#8208;fold). This study presents a thermoelastic actuator based on shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;locking of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for the first time. The dielectric and nonlinear optical switching properties of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids broaden the range of applications of mechanically responsive crystals.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Azo Cathodes Enabled by N&#8208;Heteroatomic Substitution for Zinc Batteries with a Self&#8208;Charging Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatomic substitution strategy is used to optimize the chemical and electronic properties of azo compounds. The developed 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine cathode exhibits significantly improved operating voltage, thermal stability, and reaction kinetics. Remarkably, the depleted batteries exhibit a distinctive self&#8208;charging feature upon air exposure.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active azo compounds are emerging as promising cathode materials due to their multi&#8208;electron redox capacity and fast redox response. However, their practical application is often limited by low output voltage and poor thermal stability. Herein, we use a heteroatomic substitution strategy to develop 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine. This modification results in a 350&#8197;mV increase in reduction potential compared to traditional azobenzene, increasing the energy density at the material level from 187 to 291&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The introduced heteroatoms not only raise the melting point of azo compounds from 68&#8201;&#176;C to 112&#8201;&#176;C by forming an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network but also improves electrode kinetics by reducing energy band gaps. Moreover, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine forms metal&#8208;ligand complexes with Zn2+ ions, which further self&#8208;assemble into a robust superstructure, acting as a molecular conductor to facilitate charge transfer. Consequently, the batteries display a good rate performance (192&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 60,000&#8197;cycles. Notably, we disclose that the depleted batteries spontaneously self&#8208;charge when exposed to air, marking a significant advancement in the development of self&#8208;powered aqueous systems.

This modification results in a 350&#8197;mV increase in reduction potential compared to traditional azobenzene, increasing the energy density at the material level from 187 to 291&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The introduced heteroatoms not only raise the melting point of azo compounds from 68&#8201;&#176;C to 112&#8201;&#176;C by forming an intermolecular hydrogen-bond network but also improves electrode kinetics by reducing energy band gaps. Moreover, 4,4&#8242;-azopyridine forms metal-ligand complexes with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which further self-assemble into a robust superstructure, acting as a molecular conductor to facilitate charge transfer. Consequently, the batteries display a good rate performance (192&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;C) and an ultra-long lifespan of 60,000&#8197;cycles. Notably, we disclose that the depleted batteries spontaneously self-charge when exposed to air, marking a significant advancement in the development of self-powered aqueous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Anhydrous Proton Transport in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pore Chemistry and its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal, and Kagome topologies was explored to design porous frameworks, which led to the creation of 1D nanochannels of different shapes and sizes. The pore shape and size play a vital role in developing proton carrier networks and determines proton conduction functions, unveiling a full picture of pore chemistry and offering a general yet transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials.







Abstract
Proton conduction is important in both fundamental research and technological development. Here we report designed synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks as a new platform for high&#8208;rate anhydrous proton conduction. By developing nanochannels with different topologies as proton pathways and loading neat phosphoric acid to construct robust proton carrier networks in the pores, we found that pore topology is crucial for proton conduction. Its effect on increasing proton conductivity is in an exponential mode other than linear fashion, endowing the materials with exceptional proton conductivities exceeding 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 over a broad range of temperature and a low activation energy barrier down to 0.24&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the pore size controls conduction mechanism, where mesopores promote proton conduction via a fast&#8208;hopping mechanism, while micropores follow a sluggish vehicle process. Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well&#8208;developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high&#8208;rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.

         <title>Flexible Aqueous Cr&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors with Remarkable Electrochemical Properties in all Climates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid supercapacitor assembled from a chromium metal anode based on an electroplating/stripping mechanism and a porous graphitized carbon fabric cathode is proposed. This research made an advance in developing a reversible chromium metal deposition/dissolution process, and the device obtained an efficient and stable energy storage capability under all climate circumstances.







Abstract
The integration of hostless battery&#8208;like metal anodes for hybrid supercapacitors is a realistic design method for energy storage devices with promising future applications. With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and accessible redox potential (&#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus. This work presents a breakthrough design of a flexible Cr&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (CHSC) based on a porous graphitized carbon fabric (PGCF) substrate prepared by K2FeO4 activation. In the CHSC device, PGCF acts as both a current collector and cathode material due to its high specific surface area and superior conductivity. The use of a highly concentrated LiCl&#8722;CrCl3 electrolyte with high Cr plating/stripping efficiency and excellent antifreeze properties enables the entire PGCF&#8208;based CHSC to achieve well&#8208;balanced performance in terms of energy density (up to 1.47&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2), power characteristics (reaching 9.95&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durability (95.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000&#8197;cycles), while realizing it to work well under harsh conditions of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work introduces a new concept for low&#8208;temperature energy storage technology and confirms the potential application of Cr anodes in hybrid supercapacitors.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Like Diffusion of Fast Ions in Framework Energy Materials for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assisted by density functional theory calculations, we found in this study that the origin of the ultra&#8208;low migration energy barrier of intercalated ions in framework energy materials (e.g. Prussian blue analogs) is a unique surface&#8208;like diffusion mechanism. The mobile ion will move along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance similar to surface diffusion.







Abstract
The rate performance, power density, and energy efficiency of electrochemical devices are often limited by ionic conductivities in electrolyte and electrode materials. Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high&#8208;rate electrodes for sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid&#8208;state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra&#8208;low activation energy and anomalous pre&#8208;exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid&#8208;state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface&#8208;like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface&#8208;like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle&#8208;point geometry and high migration barrier. We found that the shifting from solid&#8208;state lattice diffusion to surface&#8208;like diffusion is determined by the size difference between the mobile ion and the diffusion channel, and a lowest migration energy barrier can be reached by mediating the channel size. The analogy to gas diffusion in molecular sieves shall be discussed. Additionally, the effects of defects and crystal water in Prussian blue analogs were also discussed for better understanding their rate performances in experimental scenarios.

ATPP2SnCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ (ATPP=acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) was derived from the rational construction of emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and Sn4+ to form rigid structure, and the subsequent doping of Sb3+. Multi&#8208;excitonic emissions with one from organic cation and the other from the extrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons were investitated, and the tunable photoluminescence could be realized by varing the excitaton wavelengths. Leveraging the multi&#8208;excitonic centers for the doped samples, information encryption and decryption could be achieved, showing the potential anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;excitonic emitting materials in luminescent metal halides are emerging candidates for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. Herein, ATPP2SnCl6 (ATPP=acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) phase was designed and synthesized by rationally choosing emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and non&#8208;toxic stable metal ions of Sn4+, and Sb3+ was further doped into ATPP2SnCl6 to tune the photoluminescence with external self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The derived non&#8208;toxic ATPP2SnCl6 shows multi&#8208;excitonic luminescent centers verified by optical study and differential charge&#8208;density from density functional theory calculations. Incorporation of Sb3+ dopants and the increasing concentrations induce the efficient energy transfer therein, thus enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield from 5.1&#8201;% to 73.8&#8201;%. The multi&#8208;excitonic emission inspires the creation of information encryption and decryption by leveraging the photoluminescence from ATPPCl to ATPP2SnCl6 host and ATPP2SnCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+. This study facilitates the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application by employing solution&#8208;processable luminescent metal halides materials with excitation&#8208;dependent PL properties.

The multi-excitonic emission inspires the creation of information encryption and decryption by leveraging the photoluminescence from ATPPCl to ATPP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; host and ATPP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. This study facilitates the anti-counterfeiting application by employing solution-processable luminescent metal halides materials with excitation-dependent PL properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea over Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Electronic Metal Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy on CeO2 nanorods are designed for efficient electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2. Cu single atoms modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Alloy sites accelerate the formation of C&#8722;N bond through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO. Electronic metal support interaction further modulates the interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. Herein, we report a CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) with electronic metal support interaction (EMSI), achieving a high urea yield rate of 813.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.94&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. RHE. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that single&#8208;atom Cu sites modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Bimetallic sites synergistically accelerate C&#8722;N bond formation through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO to form *ONCO as key intermediates. More importantly, electronic metal support interaction between CuAu SAA and CeO2 carrier further modulates electron structure and interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability. This work constructs SAA electrocatalysts with EMSI effect to tailor C&#8722;N coupling at the atomic level, which can provide guidance for the development of C&#8722;N coupling systems.

         <title>Triphenylamine[3]arenes: Streamlining Synthesis of a Versatile Macrocyclic Platform for Supramolecular Architectures and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>

Efficient synthesis of triphenylamine[3]arenes using triphenylamine derivatized monomers via a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with paraformaldehyde is presented. These three&#8208;fold symmetric macrocycles, featuring alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, exhibit versatile properties in luminescence and iodine adsorption, and serve as building blocks for extended frameworks and molecular cages.







Abstract
Triphenylamine[3]arenes (TPA[3]s), featuring [16]paracyclophane backbone with alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, were synthesized through a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction using triphenylamine derivatized monomers and paraformaldehyde. This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron&#8208;donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three&#8208;fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.

         <title>Variant&#8208;Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte without Phase Separation for Low&#8208;Temperature Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal low&#8208;temperature electrolyte with variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) structure was designed to avoid the phase separation, which endowed DIBs with long&#8208;term cycling stability, excellent discharge characteristic, and outstanding low&#8208;temperature performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low&#8208;temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual&#8208;ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation structure for universal low&#8208;temperature electrolytes (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;&#8208;LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+&#8208;solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases. Thus, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high&#8208;voltage stability of &gt;5.5&#8197;V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures. Consequently, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte enables different types of batteries to achieve excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and good rate capability at both room and low temperatures. Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7&#8201;% and 51.6&#8201;%, at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, indicating great potential for low&#8208;temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration, emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.

Designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY and strong crystallinity can effectively reduce non&#8208;radiative energy losses and enhance OSC performance. We synthesized DM&#8208;F, an A&#8211;D&#8211;A fused&#8208;ring acceptor, which hinders H&#8208;aggregate formation, boosts PLQY, and shows strong near&#8208;infrared absorption and crystallinity. DM&#8208;F&#8208;based OSCs exhibit low &#9653;Enr (0.14&#8197;eV) and high PCE, reaching 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;% in binary and ternary cells, respectively.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing narrow band gap acceptors that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and strong crystallinity is a highly effective, yet challenging, approach to reducing non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#9653;Enr) and boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). We have successfully designed and synthesized an A&#8211;D&#8211;A type fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, named DM&#8208;F, which features a planar molecular backbone adorned with bulky three&#8208;dimensional camphane side groups at its central core. These bulky substituents effectively hinder the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of the acceptors, promoting the formation of more J&#8208;aggregates and notably elevating the PLQY of the acceptor in the film. As anticipated, DM&#8208;F showcases pronounced near&#8208;infrared absorption coupled with impressive crystallinity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) leveraging DM&#8208;F exhibit a high EQEEL value and remarkably low &#9653;Enr of 0.14&#8197;eV&#8208;currently the most minimal reported value for OSCs. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary OSCs utilizing DM&#8208;F has reached 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;%, respectively, marking a new apex in reported efficiency within the OSCs field. In conclusion, our study reveals that designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY is an effective way to reduce &#9653;Enr and improve the PCE of OSCs.

&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.14&#8197;eV-currently the most minimal reported value for OSCs. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary OSCs utilizing DM-F has reached 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;%, respectively, marking a new apex in reported efficiency within the OSCs field. In conclusion, our study reveals that designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY is an effective way to reduce &#9653;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; and improve the PCE of OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Upcycling of Polyethylene to Long Chain Diacid over Co&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long chain diacid was prepared by controllable oxidation of polyethylene with cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Plastic pollution is an emerging global threat due to lack of effective methods for transforming waste plastics into useful resources. Here, we demonstrate a direct oxidative upcycling of polyethylene into high&#8208;value and high&#8208;volume saturated dicarboxylic acids in high carbon yield of 85.9&#8201;% in which the carbon yield of long chain dicarboxylic (C10&#8208;C20) acids can reach 58.9% over cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 molecular sieves, in the absence of any solvent or precious metal catalyst. The distribution of the dicarboxylic acids can be controllably adjusted from short&#8208;chain (C4&#8208;C10) to long&#8208;chain ones (C10&#8208;C20) through changing cobalt loading of MCM&#8208;41 under nanoconfinement. Highly and sparsely dispersed cobalt along with confined space of mesoporous structure enables complete degradation of polyethylene and high selectivity of dicarboxylic acid in mild condition. So far, this is the first report on highly selective one&#8208;step preparation of long chain dicarboxylic acids. The approach provides an attractive solution to tackle plastic pollution and a promising alternative route to long chain diacids.

         <title>Inside Cover: Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 33/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
Low selectivity is a key scientific challenge that hinders the commercialization of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In their Research Article (e202407287), Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu et&#8197;al. found that the CH4 selectivity of p&#8208;block Bi element exhibits a &#8220;volcanic&#8221; structure&#8208;function relationship when gradually decreasing the p&#8208;band center. This CH4 selectivity of Bi element is also positively correlated with the adsorption energy of key intermediate *CHO and the photoexcited carriers separation efficiency.

Light&#8208;induced dynamic metal nanocrystal/semiconductor interfaces during carbon dioxide electroreduction were investigated by utilizing synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, as reported by Hao Ming Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403333). The dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction under illumination result in an intriguing selectivity switch and realize an improvement of at least 16&#8208;fold in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrogen Fixation Using Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Catalysts under Ambient or Mild Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalysts to convert N2 into NH3 under ambient reaction conditions, where involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer has been effective for high catalytic activity. Direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic NH3 formation, selective catalytic hydrazine formation, and catalytic C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;N bond formation have been also established.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is industrially produced from dinitrogen (N2) and dihydrogen (H2) by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, although H2 is prepared from fossil fuels, and the reaction requires harsh conditions. On the other hand, microorganisms have fixed nitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. Recently, well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalyst to convert N2 into NH3 by reactions with chemical reductants and proton sources under ambient reaction conditions. Among them, involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer is found to be very effective for high catalytic activity. Furthermore, direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions of N2 into NH3 have been recently achieved. In addition to catalytic formation of NH3, selective catalytic conversion of N2 into hydrazine (NH2NH2) and catalytic silylation of N2 into silylamines have been reported. Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation has been more recently established to afford cyanate anion (NCO&#8722;) under ambient reaction conditions. Further development of direct conversion of N2 into nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds as well as green ammonia synthesis leading to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier is expected.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Frameworks (SAFs): Shaping the Future of Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) emerge as a novel class of porous structures distinguished by their strategic use of non&#8208;covalent interactions. SAFs not only exhibit exceptional porosity, crystallinity, and structural stability, but also offer a solution to the limitations of MOFs and COFs caused by their dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics. This development represents a significant advance in porous material chemistry, opening avenues for new applications and research.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) represent a new category of porous materials, utilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions, setting them apart from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This category includes but is not restricted to hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks. SAFs stand out for their outstanding porosity, crystallinity, and stability, alongside unique dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics that enable significant structural and functional modifications. Crucially, their non&#8208;covalent assembly strategies allow for a balanced manipulation of porosity, symmetry, crystallinity, and dimensions, facilitating the creation of advanced crystalline porous materials unattainable through conventional covalent or coordination bond synthesis. Despite their considerable promise in overcoming several limitations inherent to MOFs and COFs, particularly in terms of solution&#8208;processability, SAFs have received relatively little attention in recent literature. This Minireview aims to shed light on standout SAFs, exploring their design principles, synthesis strategies, and characterization methods. It emphasizes their distinctive features and the broad spectrum of potential applications across various domains, aiming to catalyze further development and practical application within the scientific community.

Highly stereoselective Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins was promoted by a designer artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue through enamine catalysis. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroketones were prepared by this efficient biocatalytic strategy for ketone functionalization in a study highlighting the utility of artificial enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions.







Abstract
Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% e.e., &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86&#8201;%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization, and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Amino Acid Building Blocks for Bioorthogonal Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids (NPAAs) containing hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208;ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs)&#8208; is described. These NPAAs were compatible with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution peptide synthesis (SPS), allowing the introduction of reactive handles on specific sites in the presence of multiple identical residues. The obtained peptide&#8208;EBXs can be applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides with unique topological properties.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EB(X)xs) reagents have emerged as useful reagents for peptide/protein modification due to their versatile reactivity and high selectivity. Herein, we report the successful introduction of ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs) on different amino acid building blocks (Lys/Orn/Dap), and show their compatibility with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution phase peptide synthesis (SPS). The selective incorporation of the EBx core into peptide sequences enable efficient macrocyclizations under mild conditions for the synthesis of topologically unique cyclic and bicyclic peptides.

         <title>Chiral Teropyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a chiral teropyrene was achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation, leveraging InCl3 catalysis. This compound exhibits both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, underscoring its significance in advancing chiral optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
We present the inaugural synthesis of a chiral teropyrene achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation catalyzed by InCl3, resulting in good yields. The product underwent thorough characterization using FT&#8208;Raman and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies, demonstrating a close agreement with calculated spectra. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unveiled a notable twist in the molecule&#8216;s backbone, with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 51&#176;, consistent with computational predictions. Experimentally determined enantiomeric inversion barriers revealed a significant energy barrier of 23&#8197;kcal/mol, facilitating the isolation of enantiomers for analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopies. These findings mark significant strides in the synthesis and characterization of chiral teropyrenes, offering insights into their structural and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nucleobase Diversification of 4&#8242;&#8208;Thionucleosides and Application of Derived 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine for RNA Synthesis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic platform towards 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides is presented that enables both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This approach delivers entry to pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, and chemoenzymatic synthesis provided 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine as a novel nucleoside probe to monitor RNA synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven to be transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this compound class is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. We exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine on multi&#8208;milligram scale and from here switch to complete chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this probe to monitor RNA synthesis in proliferating HeLa cells, validating its capability as a new metabolic RNA labelling tool.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly efficient and enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes promoted by an easily accessible cobalt&#8208;based complex was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a wide range of alkenyl groups with diversified substitution patterns as well as axial stereogenicity into enantioenriched allylic alcohols.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes with easily accessible alkenyl halides promoted by a chiral cobalt complex derived from a newly developed tridentate bisoxazolinephosphine is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis and a general approach that enable rapid construction of highly diversified enantioenriched allylic alcohols containing a 1,1&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and trisubstituted alkene as well as axial stereogenicity in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er without the need of preformation of alkenyl&#8211;metal reagents. DFT calculations revealed the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation using a metallaphotoredox approach is a key method for rapidly building molecular complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride, a heterogeneous semiconductor, can act as a suitable photocatalyst to induce decarboxylative bond formation.

The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.

     alt="Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decarboxylative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formation using a metallaphotoredox approach is a key method for rapidly building molecular complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride, a heterogeneous semiconductor, can act as a suitable photocatalyst to induce decarboxylative bond formation. A broad scope of coupling partners is presented, in addition to photocatalyst recycling, analysis, and mechanistic investigations.

         <title>Isolable T&#8208;Shaped Planar Silyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of an unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt. The non&#8208;classical geometry enables this silyl anion to feature a silicon&#8208;centred HOMO, LUMO and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. It not only exhibits nucleophilic behaviour but also undergoes oxidative additions to CO2 and arylisonitrile. Notably, it represents the first example of silyl anions capable of cleaving C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silyl anions have garnered significant attention due to their synthetic abilities. However, previously reported silyl anions have been limited to either trigonal&#8208;pyramidal or trigonal&#8208;planar geometries, which confine them primarily as nucleophiles in substitution reactions. Herein, we report the isolation of the unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt 2 by employment of a geometrically constrained triamido pincer ligand. Theoretical calculations disclosed that the silicon centre in 2 possesses both a lone pair of electrons and an empty 3pz orbital. In addition to nucleophilic substitution reactions with Ph3PAuCl and W(CO)6, 2 readily undergoes oxidative additions with CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylisonitrile at room temperature. Furthermore, under mild conditions, compound 2 cleaves Csp2&#8722;H, Csp2&#8722;H, and H&#8722;H bonds in 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene, an intramolecular iPr group, and dihydrogen, representing the first examples of C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H activations mediated by a silyl anion, respectively. This work unveils new reactivity of silyl anions owing to the non&#8208;classical geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from C64 Nanographene Tetraimide by &#960;&#8208;Stacking Complexation with Platinum Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) at the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum is challenging to achieve. Here, we show the sensitization of C64 nanographene tetraimide's triplet state by supramolecular complexation with a platinum porphyrin that exerts an external heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling involving Pt d&#8208;orbitals and nanographene &#960;&#8208;orbitals.







Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at room temperature is challenging to achieve for organic molecules due to negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling and a low energy gap leading to fast non&#8208;radiative transitions. Here, we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to harvest the energy from the low&#8208;lying triplet state of C64 nanographene tetraimide 1. 1H&#8197;NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometric binding of a Pt(II) porphyrin on the two &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1. While the free 1 does not show emission in the NIR, the host&#8211;guest complex solution shows NIR phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. Further, between 860&#8211;1100&#8197;nm, room temperature NIR phosphorescence (&#955;max=900&#8197;nm, &#964;avg=142&#8197;&#956;s) was observed for a solid&#8208;state sample drop&#8208;casted from a preformed complex in solution. Theoretical calculations reveal a non&#8208;zero spin&#8211;orbit coupling between isoenergetic S1 and T3 of &#960;&#8208;stacked [1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pt(II) porphyrin] complex. External heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling along with rigidification and protection from oxygen in the solid&#8208;state promotes both the intersystem crossing from the first excited singlet state into the triplet manifold and the NIR phosphorescence from the lowest triplet state of 1.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Distal C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination of Aliphatic Amines as a Gateway for Forging Nitrogen&#8208;Containing sp3 Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in unprotected aliphatic amines has been developed, achieved by tuning of the electronics properties of the proximal C&#8722;H bonds via substrate protonation. Consecutive intramolecular cyclization of alkyl bromide offered a series of N&#8208;containing heterocycles characterized by high ring strains. Moreover, the resulting C(sp3)&#8722;Br serves as a synthetic linchpin can be readily transferred to C(sp3)&#8722;C, N, O bonds, enabling diverse functionalization at previously untouched C(sp3)&#8722;H sites.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new strategy that rapidly and reliably incorporates bromine atoms at distal, secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H sites in aliphatic amines with an excellent and predictable site&#8208;selectivity pattern. The resulting halogenated building blocks serve as versatile linchpins to enable a series of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;formations at remote C(sp3) sites, thus offering a new modular and unified platform that expediates the access to advanced sp3 architectures possessing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles of interest in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first enantioselective method for the cyclopropanation of difluorinated olefins is presented. Using engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts in combination with diazoacetonitrile as the carbene precursor, the present method enables the production of different fluorinated cyclopropanes with high yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigid nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8722;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono&#8208;fluorinated and gem&#8208;difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8201;e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods.

     alt="Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first enantioselective method for the cyclopropanation of difluorinated olefins is presented. Using engineered myoglobin-based catalysts in combination with diazoacetonitrile as the carbene precursor, the present method enables the production of different fluorinated cyclopropanes with high yields and high enantioselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigid nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8722;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono-fluorinated and gem-difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin-based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem-difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8201;e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods. The synthetic utility of the present approach is further exemplified through the gram-scale synthesis of a key gem-difluorinated cyclopropane intermediate useful for the preparation of fluorinated bioactive molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Ions Trigger the Gelation of Cysteine&#8208;Containing Peptide&#8208;Appended Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three FeII4L4 metal&#8208;organic cages were fabricated via a L&#8722;D&#8722;L&#8208;tripeptide ligand with different sequences. The cages could form gels triggered by coordinating thiol groups of peripheral peptides around metal vertices to the second metal ion. This strategy might allow for the modular and conventional design of other recyclable and functional cage&#8208;gel materials.







Abstract
We report a series of coordination cages that incorporate peptide chains at their vertices, prepared through subcomponent self&#8208;assembly. Three distinct heterochiral tripeptide subcomponents were incorporated, each exhibiting an L&#8722;D&#8722;L stereoconfiguration. Through this approach, we prepared and characterized three tetrahedral metal&#8208;peptide cages that incorporate thiol and methylthio groups. The gelation of these cages was probed through the binding of additional metal ions, with the metal&#8208;peptide cages acting as junctions, owing to the presence of sulfur atoms on the peripheral peptides. Gels were obtained with cages bearing cysteine at the C&#8208;terminus. Our strategy for developing functional metal&#8208;coordinated supramolecular gels with a modular design may result in the development of materials useful for chemical separations or drug delivery.

         <title>Photoinitiated Transient Self&#8208;Assembly in a Catalytically Driven Chemical Reaction Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a catalytically&#8208;driven chemical reaction network (CRN) photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light. By combining photoredox and organometallic catalysis relying on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release deactivating fuel, we can control the formation of transient supramolecular fibers. Irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of deactivating fuel, leading to faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light activation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.







Abstract
Chemically fueled chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential in controlling dissipative self&#8208;assembly. A key challenge in the field is to store chemical fuel&#8208;precursors or &#8220;pre&#8208;fuels&#8221; in the system that are converted into activating or deactivating fuels in a catalytically controlled CRN. In addition, real&#8208;time control over catalysis in a CRN by light is highly desirable, but so far not yet achieved. Here we show a catalytically driven CRN that is photoinitiated with 450&#8197;nm light, producing activated monomers that go on to perform transient self&#8208;assembly. Monomer activation proceeds via photoredox catalysis, converting the monomer alcohol groups into the corresponding aldehydes that self&#8208;assemble into large supramolecular fibers. Monomer deactivation is achieved by organometallic catalysis that relies on pre&#8208;fuel hydrolysis to release formate (i.e. the deactivating fuel). Additionally, irradiation with 305&#8197;nm light accelerates the release of formate by photo&#8208;uncaging the pre&#8208;fuel, leading to a factor of ca. 2 faster deactivation of the monomer. Overall, we show transient self&#8208;assembly upon visible light photoactivation, and tunable life&#8208;times by ultraviolet light.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 33, August 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled redox gold catalysis. Unlike the classical Cope rearrangement involving 1,5&#8208;hexadienes, a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes using the merger of &#960;&#8208;activation and cross&#8208;coupling reactivity, has been achieved.







Abstract
Cope rearrangements have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to undergo structural reorganization in stereoselective manner. While substantial advances have been achieved over decades, these rearrangements remained applicable exclusively to parent 1,5&#8208;hexadienes. Herein, we disclose the gold&#8208;catalyzed arylative Cope rearrangement of 1,6&#8208;heptadienes via a cyclization&#8208;induced [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement employing ligand&#8208;enabled gold redox catalysis. Detailed mechanistic investigations including several control experiments, cross&#8208;over experiment, HRMS analysis, 31P&#8197;NMR and DFT studies have been performed to underpin the mechanism.

CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;-amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds.
