         <title>Detection and Imaging of the Plant Pathogen Response by Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Polyphenol Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are presented. These sensors probe the polyphenol content in complex biological systems such as the plant rhizosphere. In summary, this approach enables real&#8208;time spatiotemporal visualization of plant defense via polyphenols release.







Abstract
Plants use secondary metabolites such as polyphenols for chemical defense against pathogens and herbivores. Despite their importance in plant pathogen interactions and tolerance to diseases, it remains challenging to detect polyphenols in complex plant tissues. Here, we create molecular sensors for plant polyphenol imaging that are based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We identified polyethylene glycol&#8211;phospholipids that render (6,5)&#8208;SWCNTs sensitive (Kd=90&#8197;nM) to plant polyphenols (tannins, flavonoids, &#8230;), which red&#8208;shift (up to 20&#8197;nm) and quench their emission (ca. 1000&#8197;nm). These sensors report changes in total polyphenol level after herbivore or pathogen challenge in crop plant systems (Soybean Glycine max) and leaf tissue extracts (Tococa spp.). We furthermore demonstrate remote chemical imaging of pathogen&#8208;induced polyphenol release from roots of soybean seedlings over the time course of 24&#8197;h. This approach allows in situ visualization and understanding of the chemical plant defense in real time and paves the way for plant phenotyping for optimized polyphenol secretion.

         <title>Rotation in an Enantiospecific Self&#8208;Assembled Array of Molecular Raffle Wheels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kagome network on the Ag(111) surface hosts guest molecules with enantiomeric selectivity. Each larger pore confines a single guest molecule. The punctuated pirouette of the guest molecule in this confined space is unravelled by a combination of density functional theory and variable temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy in real time at the single molecule level.







Abstract
Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic system&#8212;a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule&#8212;employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the chemically modified guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95&#8197;eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilises the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest's enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.

         <title>Photocatalytic Sulfonylcarbocyclization of Alkynes Using SEt as a Traceless Directing Group: Access to Cyclopentenes and Indenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes using SEt as a traceless directing group is developed, providing a facile access to highly substituted cyclopentenes and indenes from readily available starting materials. It represents a new advance on anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization of all&#8208;carbon systems, which may be valuable for the fast construction of five&#8208;membered carbocycles.







Abstract
Cyclopentenes and indenes are important structural scaffolds in synthetic, medical, and material chemistry. Cyclization of alkynes via remote C&#8722;H functionalization is an appealing approach to construct these motifs due to its high efficiency and step&#8208;economy. Herein, a traceless directing group strategy was designed to reverse the regioselectivity of radical addition which enabled an unprecedented photocatalytic sulfonylcarbocyclization of terminal alkynes by forming C&#8722;C bond on inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond. It offers a facile access to decorated cyclopentenes and indenes under mild conditions. The resultant products could be converted into a set of valuable molecular scaffolds, including a key intermediate of AM&#8208;6226. Mechanistic experiments suggest a radical cascade pathway comprising a Markovnikov&#8208;type sulfonylation, 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization, and &#946;&#8208;elimination. This study lays further groundwork for the use of anti&#8208;Baldwin 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization in rapidly assembling five&#8208;membered carbocycles.

         <title>Vitamin D Inhibits the Early Aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein and Modulates Exocytosis Revealed by Electrochemical Measurements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical measurement of the early aggregation of &#945;&#8208;Syn and exocytosis event of PC12, revealing a new neuroprotective role of VD that can inhibit the &#945;&#8208;Syn monomers aggregation into &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers and modulate exocytosis. This research provides an efficient strategy for early treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases associated with &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) localizes at presynaptic terminal and modulates synaptic functions. Increasing evidence demonstrate that &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, forming at the early of aggregation, are cytotoxic and is thus related to brain neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we find that vitamin D (VD) can reduce neurocytotoxicity. The reduced neurocytotoxicity might be attributed to the less amount of large&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers inhibited by VD, measured by electrochemical collision at single particle level, which are not observable with traditionally ensembled method. Single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA) results show that VD can recover the amount of neurotransmitter release during exocytosis induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn oligomers, further verifying the neuroprotection of VD. Our study reveals the neuroprotective role of VD through inhibiting &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation, which is envisioned to be of great importance in treatment and prevention of the neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Construction of Tricyclic Nitrogen Heterocycles by a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Allenynes and Application to Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold&#8208;catalyzed biscyclization of hydroxyisobutyryl (Hib)&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was promoted by BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to give 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives, some of which were converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A hexacyclic indolium salt (see structure) showed concentration&#8208;dependent photophysical properties attributable to aggregate formation.







Abstract
A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected biscyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to produce 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives in good yields. When the reaction was combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

&lt;p&gt;The gold-catalyzed biscyclization of hydroxyisobutyryl (Hib)-protected aminoallenynes was promoted by BrettPhosAuNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;PrOH to give 1,2-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]indole derivatives, some of which were converted into nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with highly conjugated &#960;-electron systems. A hexacyclic indolium salt (see structure) showed concentration-dependent photophysical properties attributable to aggregate formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold-catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected biscyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl-protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;PrOH to produce 1,2-dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;cd&lt;/i&gt;]indole derivatives in good yields. When the reaction was combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted into nitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N-PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;-electron systems. A newly obtained hexacyclic indolium salt showed characteristic concentration-dependent absorption and emission properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocycle Dynamics in a Branched [8]Catenane Controlled by Three Different Stimuli in Three Different Regions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched [8]catenane was synthesized from a one&#8208;pot procedure with good efficiency. Rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bond in the core, middle or periphery of the [8]catenane resulted in, respectively a large, middle and small degree of change in the catenane dynamics and flexibility.







Abstract
A branched [8]catenane from an efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis (72&#8201;% HPLC yield, 59&#8201;% isolated yield) featuring the simultaneous use of three kinds of templates and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;mediated azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CBAAC) for ring&#8208;closing is reported. Design and assembly of the [8]catenane precursors are unexpectedly complex that can involve cooperating, competing and non&#8208;influencing interactions. Due to the branched structure, dynamics of the [8]catenane can be modulated in different extent by rigidifying/loosening the mechanical bonds at different regions by using solvent polarity, acid&#8208;base and metal ions as the stimuli. This work not only highlights the importance of understanding the delicate interplay of the weak and non&#8208;obvious supramolecular interactions in the synthesis of high&#8208;order [n]catenane, but also demonstrates a complex control of dynamics and flexibility for exploiting [n]catenanes applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Photoinduced Unfolding of Supramolecular Polymers Leading to Topological Block Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helically folded supramolecular polymers with a high internal rigidity undergo non&#8208;uniform unfolding upon UV&#8208;irradiation, affording topological block nanofibers consisting of two distinct domains with helically folded and unfolded structures.







Abstract
Synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional nanofibers with distinct topological (higher&#8208;order structural) domains in the same main chain is one of the challenging topics in modern supramolecular polymer chemistry. Non&#8208;uniform structural transformation of supramolecular polymer chains by external stimuli may enable preparation of such nanofibers. To demonstrate feasibility of this post&#8208;polymerization strategy, we prepared a photoresponsive helically folded supramolecular polymers from a barbiturate monomer containing an azobenzene&#8208;embedded rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold. In contrast to previous helically folded supramolecular polymers composed of a more flexible azobenzene monomer, UV&#8208;light induced unfolding of the newly prepared helically folded supramolecular polymers occurred nonuniformly, affording topological block copolymers consisting of folded and unfolded domains. The formation of such blocky copolymers indicates that the photoinduced unfolding of the helically folded structures initiates from relatively flexible parts such as termini or defects. Spontaneous refolding of the unfolded domains was observed after visible&#8208;light irradiation followed by aging to restore fully folded structures.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of a Light&#8208;Activatable tRNA Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic access to modified RNA is of high importance. Both the gold standard&#8212;chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis&#8212;and enzymatic methods have limitations. The present study offers a best&#8208;of&#8208;both&#8208;worlds approach and enabled the synthesis of a tRNA derivative with four modifications. This approach is compatible with a whole toolbox of light&#8208;reactive and other modifications.







Abstract
Herein, we present a multi&#8208;cycle chemoenzymatic synthesis of modified RNA with simplified solid&#8208;phase handling to overcome size limitations of RNA synthesis. It combines the advantages of classical chemical solid&#8208;phase synthesis and enzymatic synthesis using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotinylated RNA. Successful introduction of light&#8208;controllable RNA nucleotides into the tRNAMet sequence was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The methods tolerate modifications in the RNA phosphodiester backbone and allow introductions of photocaged and photoswitchable nucleotides as well as photocleavable strand breaks and fluorophores.

         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordinating group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs). A series of tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) were generated with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5&#8201;% ee, and with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Responsive Jamming of Nanoparticle Dense Suspensions towards Macroscopic Liquid&#8208;Solid Switchable Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Nanoparticle aggregation for constructing functional materials has shown enormous advantages in various applications. Most efforts focused on ordered nanoparticle aggregation for specific functions but often limited in irreversible aggregation processes due to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Herein, we report a reversible disordered aggregation of SiO  2  &#8208;PNIPAAm nanoparticles (SPNPs) through thermo&#8208;responsive jamming, obtaining smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials. The smart materials can display a switch between liquid&#8208;like state and solid&#8208;like state responding to temperature change. This unique macroscopic behavior originates from the reversible disordered aggregation modulated by temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions among the SPNPs. Notably, the materials at solid&#8208;like state show anti&#8208;impact property and can withstand the impact of a steel sphere with a speed of 328 cm/s. We envision that this finding offers inspirations to design smart liquid&#8208;solid switchable materials for impact protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of High Energy Density Diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;Phenothiazine Hybrid Catholytes for Non&#8208;Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational molecular design, simple chemical synthesis, and structure&#8211;property computation analysis, a new catholyte with high potential, two&#8208;electron transfer, and high solubility is developed for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries.







Abstract
This report describes the design of diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;phenothiazine hybrid catholytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries. The molecules are synthesized in a rapid and modular fashion by appending a diaminocyclopropenium (DAC) substituent to the nitrogen of the phenothiazine. Combining a versatile C&#8208;N coupling protocol (which provides access to diverse derivatives) with computation and structure&#8208;property analysis enabled the identification of a catholyte that displays stable two&#8208;electron cycling at potentials of 0.64 and 1.00&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ as well as high solubility in all oxidation states (&#8805;0.45&#8197;M in TBAPF6/MeCN). This catholyte was deployed in a high energy density two&#8208;electron RFB, exhibiting &gt;90&#8201;% capacity retention over 266&#8197;hours of flow cell cycling at &gt;0.5&#8197;M electron concentration.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of a Macrobicyclic Olefin Bearing a Sacrificial Silyloxide Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;positions of the double bond as a new sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regio&#8208;selective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring with a substantial ring tension can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio&#8208;/stereospecificity.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has been regarded as a powerful tool for sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization. However, the traditional entropy&#8208;driven ROMP of macrocyclic olefins suffers from the lack of ring strain and poor regioselectivity, whereas the relay&#8208;ring&#8208;closing metathesis polymerization inevitably brings some unnecessary auxiliary structure into each monomeric unit. We developed a macrobicyclic olefin system bearing a sacrificial silyloxide bridge on the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;positions of the double bond as a new class of sequence&#8208;defined monomer for regioselective ROMP. The monomeric sequence information is implanted in the macro&#8208;ring, while the small ring, a 3&#8208;substituted cyclooctene structure with substantial ring tension, can provide not only narrow polydispersity, but also high regio&#8208;/stereospecificity. Besides, the silyloxide bridge can be sacrificially cleaved by desilylation and deoxygenation reactions to provide clean&#8208;structured, non&#8208;auxiliaried polymers.

         <title>Secondary Structure Tuning of a Pseudoprotein Between &#946;&#8208;Meander and &#945;&#8208;Helical Forms in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dipeptide functionalized with azide and alkyne, designed to undergo polymerization, crystallized in a geometry unsuitable for cycloaddition. However, it reacted at a high temperature, in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion, to yield a large polymer. The obtained polymer adopts a &#946;&#8208;meander&#8208;type secondary structure, which can be tuned to an &#945;&#8208;helix structure in solid&#8208;state by dissolution and solvent&#8208;evaporation.







Abstract
Tuning the secondary structure of a protein or polymer in the solid&#8208;state is challenging. Here we report the topochemical synthesis of a pseudoprotein and its secondary structure tuning in the solid&#8208;state. We designed the dipeptide monomer N3&#8208;Leu&#8208;Ala&#8208;NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;C&#8801;CH (1) for topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Dipeptide 1 adopts an anti&#8208;parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like stacked arrangement in its crystals. Upon heating, the dipeptide undergoes quantitative TAAC polymerization in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal fashion yielding large polymers. The reaction occurs between the adjacent monomers in the H&#8208;bonded anti&#8208;parallel stack, yielding pseudoprotein having a &#946;&#8208;meander structure. When dissolved in methanol, this pseudoprotein changes its secondary structure from &#946;&#8208;meander to &#945;&#8208;helical form and it retains the new secondary structure upon desolvation. This work demonstrates a novel paradigm for tuning the secondary structure of a polymer in the solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Deficiency&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Copper&#8208;Based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering A&#8208;site cation deficiency of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite oxides is an effective strategy to enhance their CO2 electroreduction properties. With La2&#8722;xCuO4&#8722;&#948; (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their Faradaic efficiency ratios of C2+/CH4 featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with a maximum point at x=0.1.







Abstract
We report an effective strategy to enhance CO2 electroreduction (CER) properties of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite oxides by engineering their A&#8208;site cation deficiencies. With La2&#8722;xCuO4&#8208;&#948; (L2&#8722;xC, x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, we demonstrate that their CER activity and selectivity (to C2+ or CH4) show either a volcano&#8208;type or an inverted volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with the extreme point at x=0.1. Among them, at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V, the L1.9C delivers the optimal activity (51.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (41.5&#8201;%) for C2+, comparable to or better than those of most reported Cu&#8208;based oxides, while the L1.7C exhibits the best activity (25.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (22.1&#8201;%) for CH4. Such optimized CER properties could be ascribed to the favorable merits brought by the cation&#8208;deficiency&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies and/or CuO/RP hybrids, including the facilitated adsorption/activation of key reaction species and thus the manipulated reaction pathways.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation of pyridines was developed by employing various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts under mild conditions. This method provides as an effective tool for the synthesis of valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;functionalized carbonyl frameworks with excellent C4 selectivity and the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex and medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization of heteroarenes is of considerable importance for streamlining the rapid modification of bioactive molecules. Herein, we report a general strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;carbonyl alkylation at the C4 position of pyridines with high site selectivity using various cyclopropanols and N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. In this process, hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between the generated sulfonamidyl radicals and O&#8722;H bonds of cyclopropanols generates &#946;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, providing efficient access to synthetically valuable &#946;&#8208;pyridylated (aryl)ketones, aldehydes, and esters with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. In addition, the mild method serves as an effective tool for the site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex and medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Phosphorus&#8208;Directed Borylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphines turned to be powerful directing groups for the electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation of arenes. The reaction involves P&#8208;stabilized boreniums as key intermediates. It provides a direct, efficient, and general way of preparing phosphine&#8211;boranes.







Abstract
Spectacular progress has recently been achieved in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation of phosphines as well as directed electrophilic C&#8722;H borylation. As shown here, P&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation provides a new, straightforward, and efficient access to phosphine&#8211;boranes. It operates under metal&#8208;free conditions and leverages simple, readily available substrates. It is applicable to a broad range of backbones (naphthyl, biphenyl, N&#8208;phenylpyrrole, binaphthyl, benzyl, naphthylmethyl) and gives facile access to various substitution patterns at boron (by varying the boron electrophile or post&#8208;derivatizing the borane moiety). NMR monitoring supports the involvement of P&#8208;stabilized borenium cations as key intermediates. DFT calculations reveal the existence and stabilizing effect of &#960;&#8208;arene/boron interactions in the (biphenyl)(i&#8208;Pr)2P&#8594;BBr2+ species.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multiphoton Excitation Regulator for the Activation of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through covalent modification of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide mimics and CeIII&#8208;OEt moieties in a metal&#8211;organic framework, a new multiphoton excitation approach was developed. This new strategy enables step&#8208;by&#8208;step triggering of the photoinduced electron transfer, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer and hydrogen atom transfer processes for activation of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen.







Abstract
The activation and oxidization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into value&#8208;added chemicals affords attractively economic and ecological benefits as well as central challenge in modern chemistry. Inspired by the natural enzymatic transformation, herein, we report a new multiphoton excitation approach to activate the inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and oxygen by integrating the photoinduced electron transfer (PET), ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) events together into one metal&#8208;organic framework. The well&#8208;modified nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) mimics oxidized CeIII&#8208;OEt moieties to generate CeIV&#8208;OEt chromophore and its reduced state mimics NAD. via PET. The in situ formed CeIV&#8208;OEt moiety triggers a LMCT excitation to form the alkoxy radical EtO., abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, accompanying the recovery of CeIII&#8208;OEt and the formation of alkyl radicals. The formed NAD. activates oxygen to regenerate the NAD+ for next recycle, wherein, the activated oxygen species interacts with the intermediates for the oxidization functionalization, paving a catalytic avenue for developing scalable and sustainable synthetic strategy.

         <title>Achieving Short&#8208;Wavelength Phase&#8208;Matching Second Harmonic Generation in Boron&#8208;Rich Borosulfate with Planar [BO3] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borosulfate consisting of condensed tetrahedral [BO4] and [SO4] units always possesses small birefringence and unsatisfied phase&#8208;matching property. For the first time, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planner [BO3] group has been introduced into borosulfate, leading to an evidently enhanced birefringence and a short&#8208;wavelength phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation in ABSO.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals which can produce short&#8208;wavelength lasers via a direct second harmonic generation (SHG) process are of great importance in modern laser technology. Currently, the exploration of UV NLO crystals in borosulfates is nearly stagnant since the non&#8208;phase matching (PM) property lies on the small birefringence induced by the intrinsically small optical anisotropy of the tetrahedral groups. Herein, for the first time, the planar [BO3] units were introduced into borosulfates leading to a boron&#8208;rich borosulfate (NH4)2B4SO10 with unprecedented [B4SO10]&#8734; layers and evidently enhanced birefringence. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the shortest SHG PM wavelength of 252&#8197;nm in all reported borosulfates with deep UV cutoff edge (184&#8197;nm), large SHG response (1.1&#215;KDP at 1064&#8197;nm and 0.15&#215;&#946;&#8208;BBO at 532&#8197;nm) and large birefringence (0.053 at 1064&#8197;nm) and is easy to grow single crystals via simple chemical vapor deposition method. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing planar [BO3] units to optimize birefringence of borosulfates, and also open up broad prospects for UV NLO crystals in boron&#8208;rich borosulfates.

         <title>Sink/Float Magnetic Immunoassays for In&#8208;Field Bioassays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sink/float magnetic immunoassays detect proteins, antibodies, and bacteria in samples using a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe protocol that uses a biofunctionalized small sphere, some liquid reagents and a small permanent magnet. A simple sink/float test of the sphere identifies if the analyte is above or below a predetermined level; the sphere sinks only if the analyte is above the concentration level.







Abstract
Analytical tests/devices that are used outside laboratory settings are required to have a very simple analytical protocol to get clearance by regulatory authorities. This study describes sink/float magnetic immunoassays, a new type of rapid, mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe, instrument&#8208;free tests for the detection of biomarkers in untreated biological samples that are very simple and might meet the simple&#8208;to&#8208;use criterion of authorities to be used in the field. These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8211;45&#8197;minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm&#8208;sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that uses reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C&#8208;Reactive Protein, anti&#8208;Treponema pallidum antibodies and E.&#8197;coli bacteria.

These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8211;45&#8197;minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm-sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that uses reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof-of-concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C-Reactive Protein, anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies and E.&#8197;coli bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical hydroxyborate, NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), was constructed by a covalent bond modification strategy via a facile hydrothermal reaction. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH is SHG&#8208;active at both 1064&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm, with deep&#8208;UV transparency to wavelengths below 190&#8197;nm, and good phase&#8208;matchability in the near deep&#8208;UV region, a rare combination for NLO hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064&#8197;nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532&#8197;nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190&#8197;nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.

         <title>Selective Benzylic CH&#8208;Borylations by Tandem Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inexpensive cobalt catalyst enables the combination of benzylic CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling to an overall acceptorless dehydrogenative functionalization of hydrocarbons at mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate a tandem catalysis via molecular CoI catalysts.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations are environmentally and economically attractive synthetic strategies for the construction of functional molecules as they obviate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and minimize waste generation. Great challenges reside in the control of selectivities, the utilization of unbiased hydrocarbons, and the operation of atom&#8208;economical dehydrocoupling mechanisms. An especially mild borylation of benzylic CH bonds was developed with the ligand&#8208;free pre&#8208;catalyst Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 and the bench&#8208;stable and inexpensive borylation reagent B2pin2 that produces H2 as the only by&#8208;product. A full set of kinetic, spectroscopic, and preparative mechanistic studies are indicative of a tandem catalysis mechanism of CH&#8208;borylation and dehydrocoupling via molecular CoI catalysts.

         <title>Rigid Bridge&#8208;Confined Double&#8208;Decker Platinum(II) Complexes Towards High&#8208;Performance Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence</title>

         <dc:description>
Strong intramolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt/&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions confined by rigid bridges lead to fast radiative decay and high&#8208;efficiency red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence from triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Together with short emission lifetimes, high&#8208;performance red and NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A molecular design to high&#8208;performance red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) emitters remains demanding. Herein a series of dinuclear platinum(II) complexes featuring strong intramolecular Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions has been developed by using N&#8208;deprotonated &#945;&#8208;carboline as a bridging ligand. The complexes in doped thin films exhibit efficient red to NIR emission from short&#8208;lived (&#964;=0.9&#8211;2.1&#8197;&#956;s) triplet metal&#8208;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MMLCT) excited states. Red OLEDs demonstrate high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 23.3&#8201;% among the best PtII&#8208;complex&#8208;doped devices. The maximum EQE of 15.0&#8201;% and radiance of 285&#8197;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for NIR OLEDs (&#955;EL=725&#8197;nm) are unprecedented for devices based on discrete molecular emitters. Both red and NIR devices show very small efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. Appealing operational lifetimes have also been revealed for the devices. This work sheds light on the potential of intramolecular metallophilicity for long&#8208;wavelength molecular emitters and electroluminescence.

         <title>Near&#8208;Equilibrium Growth of Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Framework/Graphene Oxide Hybrid Materials for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;phase method has been developed for the synthesis of highly conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Vacuum filtration leads to the formation of a uniform conducting film of the COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials on a variety of substrates. The overpotential of one of the materials was as low as 45&#8197;mV in 0.5&#8201;m H2SO4 and reached a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is better than all the metal&#8208;free catalysts currently available.







Abstract
Facile synthesis and post&#8208;processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) under mild synthetic conditions are highly sought after and important for widespread utilizations in catalysis and energy storage. Here we report the synthesis of the chemically stable aza&#8208;fused COFs BPT&#8208;COF and PT&#8208;COF by a liquid&#8208;phase method. The process involves the spontaneous polycondensation of vicinal diamines and vicinal diketones, and is driven by the near&#8208;equilibrium growth of COF domains at a very low monomer concentration. The method permits in&#8197;situ assembly of COFs and COF&#8208;GO hybrid materials and leads to the formation of a uniform conducting film on arbitrary substrates on vacuum filtration. When used as electrocatalysts, the as&#8208;prepared membranes show a fast hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential (45&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), which are the best among metal&#8208;free catalysts. Our results may open a new route towards the preparation of highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Installing a Green Engine To Drive an Enzyme Cascade: A Light&#8208;Powered In Vitro Biosystem for Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thylakoid membranes were introduced into an in vitro biosystem for the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate to enable the conversion of light energy into biological energy through the regeneration of NADPH and ATP (see picture). The use of thylakoid membranes as a green engine in this way is a promising strategy for light&#8208;powered cell&#8208;free biomanufacturing.







Abstract
Many existing in vitro biosystems harness power from the chemical energy contained in substrates and co&#8208;substrates, and light or electric energy provided from abiotic parts, leading to a compromise in atom economy, incompatibility between biological and abiotic parts, and most importantly, incapability to spatiotemporally co&#8208;regenerate ATP and NADPH. In this study, we developed a light&#8208;powered in vitro biosystem for poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthesis using natural thylakoid membranes (TMs) to regenerate ATP and NADPH for a five&#8208;enzyme cascade. Through effective coupling of cofactor regeneration and mass conversion, 20&#8197;mM PHB was yielded from 50&#8197;mM sodium acetate with a molar conversion efficiency of carbon of 80.0&#8201;% and a light&#8208;energy conversion efficiency of 3.04&#8201;%, which are much higher than the efficiencies of similar in vitro PHB synthesis biosystems. This suggests the promise of installing TMs as a green engine to drive more enzyme cascades.

         <title>Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Application of peri&#8208;Pentacenopentacene: Localized Representation of Benzenoid Aromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acenes and peri&#8208;acenoacenes should be seen as &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems containing one and two localized aromatic sextets, respectively, flanked with ortho&#8208;fused diene fragments. The vertical extension of TIPS&#8208;PEN, TIPS&#8208;PPP, has been prepared from a dione precursor and absorbs at longer wavelengths, is 16 times more stable, exhibits a 2D brickwall motif in crystals with stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and a smaller reorganization energy.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of TIPS&#8208;peri&#8208;pentacenopentacene (TIPS&#8208;PPP), a vertical extension of TIPS&#8208;pentacene (TIPS&#8208;PEN) and a low&#8208;band&#8208;gap material with remarkable stability. We found the synthetic conditions to avoid the competition between 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;addition of lithium acetylide on the large aromatic dione. The high stability of TIPS&#8208;PPP is due to the peri&#8208;fusion which increases the aromaticity by generating two localized aromatic sextets that are flanked with 2 diene fragments, similar to two fused&#8208;anthracenes. Like TIPS&#8208;PEN, TIPS&#8208;PPP shows the archetypal 2D brickwall motif in crystals with a larger transfer integral and smaller reorganization energy. The high mobility of up to 1&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was obtained in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor fabricated by a wet process. Also, TIPS&#8208;PPP was used as a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitter for NIR organic&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode devices resulting in a high external quantum efficiency at 800&#8197;nm.

         <title>Synthesis of Functionalized Silsesquioxane Nanomaterials by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbene Insertion into Si&#8722;H bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene insertion into Si&#8722;H bonds of silsesquioxane silanes was accomplished using RhII catalysis and diazo compounds as carbene precursors. Silsesquioxanes with up to eight Si&#8722;H bonds were functionalized up to gram&#8208;scale. Diazo compounds with a fluorinated octyl group and BODIPY fluorophore were accessed to highlight the utility of diazo chemistry. Further transformations including a cross&#8208;coupling and ester deprotection are demonstrated.







Abstract
We report carbene insertion into Si&#8722;H bonds of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) for the synthesis of highly functionalized siloxane nanomaterials. Dirhodium(II) carboxylates catalyze insertion of aryl&#8208;diazoacetates as carbene precursors to afford POSS structures containing both ester and aryl groups as orthogonal functional handles for further derivatization of POSS materials. Four diverse and structurally varied silsesquioxane core scaffolds with one, three, or eight Si&#8722;H bonds were evaluated with diazo reactants to produce a total of 20 new POSS compounds. Novel diazo compounds containing a fluorinated octyl group and boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore demonstrate the use of highly functionalized substrates. Transformations of aryl(ester)&#8208;functionalized POSS compounds derived from this method are demonstrated, including ester hydrolysis and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Mechanical Bending and Reversible Fluorescence Switching in a Single Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slender single crystal based on azine exhibits controllable plastic bending and fluorescence enhancement upon UV light irradiation or acid vapor fuming, as well as elastic bending under external force and mechanoresponsive fluorescence. This is the first smart single crystal exhibiting fluorescence lit up upon bending triggered by UV light irradiation and exposure to acid.







Abstract
Fluorescent single crystals that respond to multiple external stimuli are of great interest in molecular machines, sensors, and displays. The integration of photo&#8208; or acid&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement and bending in one organic crystal, however, has not been reported yet. Herein, we report the interesting plastic photomechanical bending and switching on of the fluorescence of an azine crystal in a single&#8208;crystal transformation, due to extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and molecular slippage. Moreover, the fluorescent plastic bending driven by multiple volatile acid vapors was firstly observed, and attributed to the synergistic effect of push&#8211;pull electronic structure and hydrogen bonding. The single crystal also shows high elasticity under external force. In addition, reversible fluorescence switching can be triggered by grinding and solvent fuming, as well as by the adsorption and desorption of HCl vapor. The integration of plastic, elastic bending and switch&#8208;on fluorescence into one single crystal provides a new strategy for next&#8208;generation smart materials.

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1) in&#8208;situ controllable H2S release, (2) concomitant fluorescence response, and (3) mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Raman probing of hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces with atomic layer accuracy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic metals under photoexcitation can generate energetic hot electrons to directly induce chemical reactions. However, the capability and fundamental insights of the transportation of these hot electrons at plasmonic metal&#8208;2D material interfaces remain unclear. Herein, hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces has been in situ studied using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with atomic layer accuracy. Combining in situ SERS studies with density functional theory calculations, it is proved that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and directly penetrate graphene to trigger photocatalytic reactions. With increasing graphene layers, the transportation of hot electrons decays rapidly and would be completely blocked after five layers of graphene. Moreover, the transfer of hot electrons can be modulated by applying an external electric field, and the hot&#8208;electron transfer efficiency under electrochemical conditions is improved by over three times in the presence of a monolayer of graphene. These fundamental understandings about hot&#8208;electron transfer provide insightful information to promote the design of more efficient plasmonic materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single&#8208;atom catalysts have received widespread attentions and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non&#8208;metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) via high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8208;Se&#8208;C bond. Impressively, the obtained single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpass state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. Our discoveries demonstrate the promising prospects for utilizing metal&#8208;free single atom&#8208;based materials for efficient electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenanthrocarbazole&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymer with Noncovalently Conformational Locking for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs). Constraining configurational variation of polymer chains to afford a rigid and planar backbone can reduce unfavorable reorganization energy and improve hole mobility.  Herein, a noncovalently conformational locking via S&#8208;&#8208;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (  PC  ) based polymeric HTM,  PC6  , to fix molecular geometries and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic study from structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of  PC  remarkably enhances &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at perovskite/HTM interface and further depressing interfacial recombination. Consequently, PSC employing  PC6  as dopant&#8208;free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13 &#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with ~ 1.3 nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li  0.33  La  0.557  TiO  3  (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in&#8208;situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li  +  transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15 &#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10  &#8722;5  S cm  &#8722;1  and conductance of 87.2 mS at 30  o  C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24 GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO  4  battery.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial infection is one of the greatest threats to public health. In vivo real&#8208;time monitoring and effective treatment of infected sites through non&#8208;invasive techniques, remain a challenge. Herein, we designed a Pt(II) metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer through the host&#8211;guest interaction between a pillar[5]arene&#8208;modified metallacycle and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl]pyridinium. Benefit from this design, such supramolecular photosensitizer, with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, demonstrated improved fluorescence performance and efficient photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacteria. In vivo studies revealed that it displayed precise fluorescence tracking of  S. aureus  &#8208;infected sites, and in situ performed image&#8208;guided efficient PDI of  S. aureus  without noticeable side effects. These results demonstrated that metallacycle combined with host&#8208;guest chemistry could provide a paradigm for the development of powerful photosensitizers for biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Imparting CO2 Electroreduction Auxiliary for Integrated Morphology Tuning and Performance Boosting in a Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategies that enable simultaneous morphology&#8208;tuning and electroreduction performance boosting are much desired for the exploration of covalent organic frameworks in efficient CO2 electroreduciton. Herein, a kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and investigate their CO2 electroreduction performance. The obtained nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Tph&#8208;COF&#8208;Dct) with large&#8208;scale (~1.0 &#956;m) and ultrathin (~3.8 nm) morphology enable a superior FECH4 (~80%) (almost doubly enhanced than bare COF) with large current&#8208;density (&#8208;220.0 mA cm&#8208;2) at &#8208;0.9 V. The boosted performance can be ascribed to the immobilized functionalizing exfoliation agent (Dct groups) with integrated amino and triazine groups that strengthen CO2 absorption/activation, stabilize intermediates and enrich the CO concentration around the Cu active sites as revealed by DFT calculations. The point&#8208;to&#8208;point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst for CO2 electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Structural Changes and Thermodynamics in Protein Phase Separation Processes of an Intrinsically Ordered&#8208;Disordered Protein Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions associated with coacervates and liquid&#8208;liquid phase transitions. However, the conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least&#8208;squares global Boltzmann&#8208;fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)  20  , (VPGVG)  40  and (VPGVG)  60  , we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;&#8208;turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of ~20 repeat units). The differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;&#8208;turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly processes with implications for the design of protein&#8208;based smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical, Highly Open Microtubes and Columnar Liquid Crystals Self&#8208;Assembled from Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Colloidal Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of simple building blocks to produce hierarchical and porous structured materials is highly desired. Rings are simple colloidal particles but unique for their internal cavities. Here we report the self&#8208;assembly (SA) of colloidal rings with tunable asymmetry mediated by a depletion force and demonstrate a variety of porous colloidal superstructure from microtubes, flexible chains, (plastic) crystals to highly open liquid crystals (LCs) can be formed along the predesigned SA paths. In particular, the SA is staged in binary or ternary systems. Large rings first form complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies by capturing smaller rings, which, as new building blocks, can further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. Moreover, a plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found from asymmetrical rings. The SA with colloidal rings opens a new avenue to construct hierarchical and porous ordered metamaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>19F NMR Allows to Investigate the Fate of Platinum(IV) Prodrugs in Physiological Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt(IV) prodrugs can overcome resistance and side effects of conventional Pt(II) anticancer therapies. By  19  F&#8208;labeling of a Pt(IV) prodrug (Pt&#8208;FBA, FBA =  p  &#8208;fluorobenzoate), the activation under physiological conditions could be investigated. It is found that, unlike single&#8208;electron reductants, multi&#8208;electron agents can efficiently promote the two electrons reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). Moreover, the activation of Pt&#8208;FBA in cell lysate is highly dependent upon the type of cancer cells. When administered to  E. coli  , Pt&#8208;FBA is reduced intracellularly and free FBA can shuttle out of the cell. Interestingly, the reduction rate greatly increases by inducing metallothionein overexpression and is lowered by addition of Zn(II) ions. Finally, when injected into mice, Pt&#8208;FBA undergoes fast reduction in the bloodstream accompanied by metabolic degradation of FBA; nevertheless, unreduced Pt&#8208;FBA can accumulate to detectable levels in liver and kidneys. The proposed  19  F&#8208;NMR approach has the advantage of avoiding the interference of all background signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Containing Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for Capture of Low&#160;Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capture of low concentration CO  2  presents numerous challenges. Here, we report that zinc containing chabazite (CHA) zeolites can realize high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and low desorption energy when capturing  ca.  400 ppm CO  2  . Control of the state and location of the zinc ions in the CHA cage is critical to the performance. Zn  2+  loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb  ca.  0.51 mmol CO  2  /g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  7, a 17&#8208;fold increase compared to the parent H&#8208;form. The capacity is increased further to  ca.  0.67 mmol CO  2  /g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six&#8208;membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO  2  adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites are worthy of further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO  2  .</dc:description>

Zn  2+  loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six-membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb  ca.  0.51 mmol CO  2  /g-zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  7, a 17-fold increase compared to the parent H-form. The capacity is increased further to  ca.  0.67 mmol CO  2  /g-zeolite with Si/Al=  ca.  2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six-membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO  2  adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites are worthy of further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO  2  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Interface pH by N&#8208;Modified Graphdiyne for Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn2+  (rather than the coordinated H2O), avoiding O&#8208;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn&#8208;V6O13  battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65 mA cm&#8208;2  and 1.07 mAh cm&#8208;2. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented UiO&#8208;67 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane with Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) membranes with high pore density and tunable pore size down to subnanoscale exhibit great potentials in ion separation when appropriately designed and prepared. By a washing&#8208;assisted secondary growing method, a well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along [022] direction is synthesized on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;modified AAO substrate. Because of the oriented growth of UiO&#8208;67 nanocrystals, highly interconnected ion&#8208;transporting channels are created throughout the UiO&#8208;67/AAO membrane to achieve ultrahigh Li  +  permeance of 27.01 mol&#183;m  &#8722;2  &#183;h  &#8722;1  as well as very decent Li  +  /Mg  2+  selectivity of up to 159.4. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high selectivity is associated with the large disparity of transport energy barrier between Li  +  and Mg  2+  , which is caused by different extent of ion dehydration in unique bimodal and oriented membrane channels.</dc:description>

         <title>Lactone Backbone Density in Rigid Electron&#8208;Deficient Semiconducting Polymers Enabling High n&#8208;type Organic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50% (P&#8208;50), and 75% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37 eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12 S/cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;CO2  batteries are explored as promising power systems to alleviate environmental issues and to implement space applications. However, sluggish cathode kinetics of CO2  reduction/evolution result in low round&#8208;trip efficiency and poor cycling stability of the fabricated energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, we design a heterostructued photocathode comprising carbon nanotube and carbon nitride to accelerate cathode reactions of a Li&#8208;CO2  battery under illumination. Benefiting from the unique defective structure of carbon nitride&#160;and favorable interfacial charge transfer, the photocathode effectively harvests ultraviolet&#8208;visible light to generate abundant photoexcited carriers and coordinates energetic photoelectrons/holes to participate in the discharge/charge reactions, leading to efficient photo&#8208;energy utilization in decreasing reaction barriers and enhancing thermodynamic reversibility of Li&#8208;CO2  battery. The resulting battery delivers high round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.8% (ultralow voltage hysteresis of 0.04 V) and superior cycling stability (86.1% efficiency retention after 100 cycles).</dc:description>

We address this challenge employing a series of isoreticular cationic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, namely iMOF&#8208;nC (n = 5, 6, 7). All three square lattice topology MOFs registered higher C2H2 uptakes versus the competing C2&#8208;C1 gases (C2H4, CO2 and CH4). Dynamic column breakthrough experiments on the best&#8208;performing iMOF&#8208;6C revealed the first three&#8208;in&#8208;one C2H2 adsorption selectivity guided separation of C2H2 from 1:1 C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CH4 mixtures. Density functional theory calculations critically examined the C2H2 selective interactions in iMOF&#8208;nC. Thanks to the abundance of square lattice topology MOFs, this study introduces a crystal engineering blueprint for designing C2H2&#8208;selective layered metal&#8208;organic physisorbents, previously unreported in cationic frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Bonded Cubic AsN from High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Chemical Reactivity of Arsenic and Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reactivity between As and N2  , leading to the synthesis of crystalline arsenic nitride, is here reported under high pressure and high temperature conditions generated by laser heating in a Diamond Anvil Cell. Single crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at different pressures between 30 and 40 GPa provides evidence for the synthesis of a covalent compound of AsN stoichiometry, crystallizing in a cubic  P213 space group, in which each of the two elements is single&#8208;bonded to three atoms of the other and hosts an electron lone pair, in a tetrahedral anisotropic coordination. The identification of characteristic structural motifs highlights the key role played by the directional repulsive interactions between non&#8208;bonding electron lone pairs in the formation of the AsN structure. Additional data indicate the existence of AsN at room temperature from 9.8 up to 50 GPa. Implications concern fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and the synthesis of innovative advanced materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy Versus Enthalpy Controlled Temperature/Redox Dual&#8208;Triggered Cages for Selective Anion Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New C3&#8208;symmetric imidazole ligands were designed with phosphine and phosphine oxide linkers (LP and LPO, respectively) to demonstrate a dual&#8208;triggered dynamic closed coordination cage. Both LP and LPO form discrete Zn4L4&#8208;closed cages (1P and 1PO, respectively) with excellent selectively for BPh4&#8722;, whereas 1P and 1PO encapsulate neither a slightly larger size anion [B(C6H4CH3)4&#8722;] nor smaller size anions (BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, SbF6&#8722;, and OSO2CF3&#8722;). 1PO exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343 K) (trigger 1: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1PO &#8644; 1PO + BPh4&#8722;). In contrast 1P has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298 K to 343 K). The 1P cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the 1PO cage by a mild oxidant (Ox. = H2O2), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1P + Ox. &#8594; 1PO + BPh4&#8722;).</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insight into the Catalytic Mechanism of the Endoperoxide Synthase FtmOx1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG)&#8208;dependent non&#8208;heme FtmOx1 catalyzes the endoperoxide biosynthesis of verruculogen. Although several mechanistic studies have been carried out, the catalytic mechanism of FtmOx1 is not well determined due to the lack of the reliable complex structure of FtmOx1 with fumitremorgin B. Here we provided the X&#8208;ray structure of the ternary complex FtmOx1&#8226;2OG&#8226;fumitremorgin B at resolution of 1.22 &#197;. Our structures show that the binding of fumitremorgin B has induced the significant compression of the active pocket and Y68 in close proximity to C26 of the substrate. Further MD simulation and QM/MM calculations support the CarC&#8208;like mechanism proposed by Bollinger and coworkers, in which Y68 rather than Y224 acts as the H atom donor for quenching the C26&#8208;centered substrate radical. Our work is consistent with all available experimental data and highlights the importance of the accurate complex structure in mechanistic study of enzymatic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Chemiresistive Detection of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the demonstration of a series of heterobimetallic, isoreticular 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metallophthalocyanine (MPc, M=Co and Ni) units interconnected by Cu nodes towards low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensing of ppm&#8208;levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Devices achieve sub&#8208;part&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) limits of detection (LOD) of 0.53 ppm toward CO at low driving voltages of 0.1 V. MPc&#8208;based Cu&#8208;linked MOFs can continuously detect CO at 50 ppm, the permissible exposure limit required by Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, for multiple exposures and realize CO detection in air and humid environment. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes for CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes under Air: Facile Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of FSO2 radicals under electrochemical conditions is reported. Various sulfonyl fluorides and heterocycles, including a novel oxathiazole dioxide heterocycle, can be obtained in good to excellent yields. Some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives showed potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.







Abstract
Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO2 radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides or &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

         <title>Truly&#8208;Biocompatible Gold Catalysis Enables Vivo&#8208;Orthogonal Intra&#8208;CNS Release of Anxiolytics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Making drugs in the brain! Fully&#8208;biocompatible Au catalysis enables for the first time the localized uncaging of a neuroactive agent, the anxiolytic drug fluoxetine, directly in the head of zebrafish by using catalytically&#8208;enhanced Au&#8208;polymer composites as safe catalytic reactors.







Abstract
Being recognized as the best&#8208;tolerated of all metals, the catalytic potential of gold (Au) has thus far been hindered by the ubiquitous presence of thiols in organisms. Herein we report the development of a truly&#8208;catalytic Au&#8208;polymer composite by assembling ultrasmall Au&#8208;nanoparticles at the protein&#8208;repelling outer layer of a co&#8208;polymer scaffold via electrostatic loading. Illustrating the in vivo&#8208;compatibility of the novel catalysts, we show their capacity to uncage the anxiolytic agent fluoxetine at the central nervous system (CNS) of developing zebrafish, influencing their swim pattern. This bioorthogonal strategy has enabled &#8208;for the first time&#8208; modification of cognitive activity by releasing a neuroactive agent directly in the brain of an animal.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being recognized as the best-tolerated of all metals, the catalytic potential of gold (Au) has thus far been hindered by the ubiquitous presence of thiols in organisms. Herein we report the development of a truly-catalytic Au-polymer composite by assembling ultrasmall Au-nanoparticles at the protein-repelling outer layer of a co-polymer scaffold via electrostatic loading. Illustrating the in vivo-compatibility of the novel catalysts, we show their capacity to uncage the anxiolytic agent fluoxetine at the central nervous system (CNS) of developing zebrafish, influencing their swim pattern. This bioorthogonal strategy has enabled -for the first time- modification of cognitive activity by releasing a neuroactive agent directly in the brain of an animal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Carboxylic Acids from Alkynes and Formic Acid by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reactions: Facile Synthesis of Profens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple nickel catalyst converts terminal alkynes and formic acid to &#945;&#8208;chiral carboxylic acids in high enantioselectivity. The reaction proceeds via the hydrocarboxylation of alkynes and enantioselective transfer hydrogenation of acrylic acids.







Abstract
We report a stereoselective conversion of terminal alkynes to &#945;&#8208;chiral carboxylic acids using a nickel&#8208;catalyzed domino hydrocarboxylation&#8208;transfer hydrogenation reaction. A simple nickel/BenzP* catalyst displayed high activity in both steps of regioselective hydrocarboxylation of alkynes and subsequent asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The reaction was successfully applied in enantioselective preparation of three nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory profens (&gt;90&#8201;% ees) and the chiral fragment of AZD2716.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Dearomatization by Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation/Claisen Rearrangement: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirolactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement is disclosed that involves an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds and allows the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of various valuable spirolactams. Moreover, the asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization is also achieved via kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis.







Abstract
Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a range of valuable spirolactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Importantly, an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds is involved in this tandem sequence. Moreover, an asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization was also achieved by efficient kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. In addition, the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement is shown to be kinetically preferred over the related [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement by theoretical calculations.

The first osmium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative C&#8722;H annulation is disclosed. While improved selectivities are possible, unprecedented osmium intermediates are presented along with detailed kinetic studies, which revealed the working mode of osmaelectrocatalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose osmaelectrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activations that set the stage for electrooxidative alkyne annulations by benzoic acids. The osmium electrocatalysis enables site&#8208; and chemoselective electrooxidative C&#8722;H activations with unique levels of selectivity. The isolation of unprecedented osmium(0) and osmium(II) intermediates, along with crystallographic characterization and analyses by spectrometric and spectroscopic in&#8197;operando techniques delineate a synergistic osmium redox catalyst regime. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed a facile C&#8722;H cleavage, which allows for an ample substrate scope, providing provide robust and user&#8208;friendly access to annulated heterocycles.

         <dc:description>
We report a rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) anolyte for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs). R&#8208;Vi possesses a low membrane&#8208;penetration rate of &#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologens in AORFBs simultaneously. The R&#8208;Vi&#8208;based AORFB exhibits an extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous charging&#8211;discharging processes.







Abstract
A stable rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) derivative is developed through a spatial&#8208;structure&#8208;adjustment strategy for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). The obtained R&#8208;Vi features four individual methyl groups on the 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine core ring. The tethered methyls confine the movement of the alkyl chain as well as the sulfonic anion, thus driving the spatial structure from sigmoid to rod shape. The R&#8208;Vi with weak charge attraction and large molecular dimension displays an ultralow membrane permeability that is only 14.7&#8201;% of that of typical sigmoid viologen. Moreover, the electron&#8208;donating effect of methyls endows R&#8208;Vi with the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologen&#8208;based AORFBs. The AORFB with the R&#8208;Vi anolyte and a K4Fe(CN)6 catholyte exhibits an energy efficiency up to 87&#8201;% and extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous cycles.

         <title>Combined Precursor Engineering and Grain Anchoring Leading to MA&#8208;Free, Phase&#8208;Pure, and Stable &#945;&#8208;Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based additives in precursor solutions suppressed the formation of the undesired &#948; phase during the crystallization of FAPbI3) perovskites, and heat&#8208;induced permeation of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide (tBBAI) into inner perovskite grains stabilized the &#945; structure. Solar cells assembled from this material exhibited improved power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. The incorporation of volatile FA&#8208;based additives in the precursor solutions completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized when 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide is permeated into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained &#8776;90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after storage at 50&#8201;&#176;C for over 1600&#8197;hours.

&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the most promising candidate materials for high-efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare methylammonium (MA)-free and phase-pure stable &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films. The incorporation of volatile FA-based additives in the precursor solutions completely suppresses the formation of non-perovskite &#948;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;-phase are anchored together and stabilized when 4-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylbenzylammonium iodide is permeated into the &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21&#8201;% for FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained &#8776;90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after storage at 50&#8201;&#176;C for over 1600&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetraaryldiborane(4) Can Emit Dual Fluorescence Responding to the Structural Change around the B&#8211;B Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly synthesized tetramesityldiborane(4) shows exceptional chemical stability and blue/orange dual fluorescence capability associated with the B&#8722;B bond rotation in the excited state. The relative intensity of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, highlighting the potential of this diborane(4) as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.







Abstract
We report the successful synthesis of tetramesityldiborane(4) (Mes4B2) through the reductive coupling of a dimesitylborinium ion. Owing to the steric protection conferred by the mesityl groups, Mes4B2 shows exceptional chemical stability and remains intact in water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that Mes4B2 has an orthogonal geometry, where the B&#8211;B center is completely hidden by the mesityl groups. Remarkably, Mes4B2 emits dual fluorescence at 460 and 620&#8197;nm, both in solution and in the solid state. Theoretical calculations showed that Mes4B2 in the excited S1 state adopts a twisted or planar geometry, which is responsible for the shorter&#8208; or longer&#8208;wavelength fluorescence, respectively. The intensity ratio of the dual fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity of the medium, which suggests that Mes4B2 has potential as a ratiometric viscosity sensor.

         <title>The Formal Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amines and Carboxylic Acids to Form sp3&#8211;sp3 Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amine&#8211;carboxylic acid C&#8722;C coupling would be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions. Using miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation, we have developed the first amine&#8211;acid cross&#8208;coupling to form C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds based on preactivation of the building blocks and nickel catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed a deaminative&#8211;decarboxylative protocol to form new carbon(sp3)&#8211;carbon(sp3) bonds from activated amines and carboxylic acids. Amines and carboxylic acids are ubiquitous building blocks, available in broad chemical diversity and at lower cost than typical C&#8722;C coupling partners. To leverage amines and acids for C&#8722;C coupling, we developed a reductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling utilizing building block activation as pyridinium salts and redox&#8208;active esters, respectively. Miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation studies were critical to our reaction optimization, with subtle experimental changes such as order of reagent addition, composition of a binary solvent system, and ligand identity having a significant impact on reaction performance. The developed protocol is used in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceuticals while more than one thousand systematically captured and machine&#8208;readable reaction datapoints are reposited.

         <title>Controlled Asymmetric Charge Distribution of Active Centers in Conjugated Polymers for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free conjugated polymer (CP) catalysts were developed with different degrees of asymmetry. The polymer catalyst with both asymmetric backbone and sidechain configuration provides larger dipole moment, regulated charge distribution, and higher ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Active center reconstruction is essential for high performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Usually, the ORR activity stems from the electronic environment of active sites by charge redistribution. We introduce an asymmetry strategy to adjust the charge distribution of active centers by designing conjugated polymer (CP) catalysts with different degrees of asymmetry. We synthesized asymmetric backbone CP (asy&#8208;PB) by modifying B&#8592;N coordination bonds and asymmetric sidechain CP (asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A) with different alkyl chain lengths. Both CPs with backbone and sidechain asymmetry exhibit superior ORR performance to their symmetric counterparts (sy&#8208;P and sy&#8208;PB). The asy&#8208;PB with greater asymmetry shows higher catalytic activity than asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A with relatively smaller asymmetry. DFT calculations reveal that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by asymmetric structure endows the center carbon atom of bipyridine with efficient catalytic activity.

         <title>Parahydrogen Hyperpolarization Allows Direct NMR Detection of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids in Complex (Bio)mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization allows the detection and quantification of &#945;&#8208;amino acids down to sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method can also be applied to aqueous mixtures after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment. This direct approach was tested on human urine, allowing a well&#8208;resolved detection of amino acids despite the complexity of the mixture.







Abstract
The scope of non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization (nhPHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low&#8208;cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to nhPHIP for unmodified &#945;&#8208;amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method was tested on human urine, in which natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids could be measured after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment.

         <title>Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I: Biosynthetic Origins of the Elusive Racemic Papaveraceae Isoxazolidine Alkaloids**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I, an isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloid, is realized through a biomimetic strategy. The synthesis sheds light to the possible biosynthetic origins of these elusive natural product family members.







Abstract
The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloids Setigerumine&#8197;I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse&#8208;electron demand 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate.

     alt="Synthesis of (&#177;)-Setigerumine&#8197;I: Biosynthetic Origins of the Elusive Racemic Papaveraceae Isoxazolidine Alkaloids**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first synthesis of (&#177;)-Setigerumine&#8197;I, an isoxazolidine &lt;i&gt;Papaveraceae&lt;/i&gt; alkaloid, is realized through a biomimetic strategy. The synthesis sheds light to the possible biosynthetic origins of these elusive natural product family members.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine &lt;i&gt;Papaveraceae&lt;/i&gt; alkaloids Setigerumine&#8197;I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)-Setigerumine&#8197;I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse-electron demand 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate. The work opens this previously inaccessible family of natural products for biological studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Supramolecular Cascaded Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Capturing System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded RTP&#8208;capturing system was constructed based on a multivalent supramolecular aggregate using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD) in aqueous medium. Energy transfer from G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD to primary (RhB or DBT) and then to secondary energy acceptors (Cy5 or NiB) gives rise to long&#8208;range and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence, especially NIR delayed emission (675&#8197;nm).







Abstract
An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded phosphorescence&#8208;capturing aggregate was constructed by multivalent co&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and amphipathic sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD). The initial dibromophthalimide derivative (G) generated a weak phosphorescent emission at 505&#8197;nm by host&#8211;guest interaction with CB[7], which further assembled with SC4AD to form homogeneously spherical nanoparticles with a dramatic enhancement of both phosphorescence lifetime to 1.13&#8197;ms and emission intensity by 40&#8208;fold. Notably, this G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD aggregate exhibited efficient phosphorescence energy transfer to Rhodamine B (RhB) and benzothiadiazole (DBT) with high efficiency (&#981;ET) of 84.4&#8201;% and 76.3&#8201;% and an antenna effect (AE) of 289.4 and 119.5, respectively, and then each of these can function as a bridge to further transfer their energy to second near&#8208;IR acceptors Cy5 or Nile blue (NiB) to achieve cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer. The final aggregate with long&#8208;range effect from 425&#8197;nm to 800&#8197;nm and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence was further employed as an imaging agent for multicolour cell labeling.

         <title>Stable Singlet Carbenes as Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA), can be more basic than Verkade proazaphosphatrane and even Schwesinger phosphazene P4(tBu). With these results it is demonstrated that carbenes should not be overlooked as neutral purely organic superbases.







Abstract
A simple experimental procedure for scaling carbene Br&#248;nsted basicity is described. The results highlight the strong basicity of pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbene, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA). They are more basic (pKaH &gt;42.7 in acetonitrile) than the popular proazaphosphatrane Verkade bases, and even the Schwesinger phosphazene superbase P4(tBu). The basicity of these compounds can readily be tuned, and they are accessible in multigram quantities. These results open new avenues for carbon centered superbases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ion Intercalation and High Volumetric Capacitance in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Porous Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (Ni3BHT) demonstrates rapid and reversible intercalation of both cations and anions in an electrochemical capacitor (EC). This first observation of dual&#8208;ion intercalation in ECs presents a unique scenario, wherein cation intercalation in Ni3BHT is pseudocapacitive but anion intercalation is capacitive in nature.







Abstract
Intercalation is a promising ion&#8208;sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to the electrochemical surface area. It requires a rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material, and it must occur without phase transformations. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni3(benzenehexathiol) (Ni3BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni3BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reaction to 1,4,2&#8208;Diazaborole&#8208;Type Heteroarene Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction product between the bulky FmesBH2 borane and an isonitrile serves as a B/N frustrated Lewis pair that adds nitriles to form the dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole heteroarene derivatives. One example of this class of compounds was shown to undergo a cycloaddition reaction with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide.







Abstract
The borane FmesBH2 reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivative with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinones are used for quantitative UV/CD sensing of the concentration and enantiomeric excess of more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids. The integration of redox switching into the sensing protocol allows spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra that are obtained with challenging compound mixtures.







Abstract
(Pseudo)halogenated quinones react smoothly with chiral amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids toward push&#8211;pull conjugates with optical sensing and switching applications. The chiroptically active conjugates serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states with remarkably different UV and CD signatures. Addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone derivative that is quantitatively re&#8208;oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox switch system combines several attractive features such as simple set&#8208;up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, and thermal and photochemical stability.

     alt="Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinones are used for quantitative UV/CD sensing of the concentration and enantiomeric excess of more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids. The integration of redox switching into the sensing protocol allows spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra that are obtained with challenging compound mixtures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Pseudo)halogenated quinones react smoothly with chiral amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids toward push&#8211;pull conjugates with optical sensing and switching applications. The chiroptically active conjugates serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states with remarkably different UV and CD signatures. Addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone derivative that is quantitatively re-oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox switch system combines several attractive features such as simple set-up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, and thermal and photochemical stability. A conceptually new sensing approach that is based on integrated chiroptical amplification and redox switching enables on-the-fly deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for quantitative er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers in varying enantiomeric compositions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cyclic carbocations are important intermediates in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction over zeolite. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112948), Jun Xu and co&#8208;workers report that the carbocations formed in the MTO reaction can capture small hydrocarbon molecules via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions have been identified by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and confirmed to be the key factors in modulating reaction properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate detection of hepatic hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) to monitor H  2  S&#8208;related enzymes&#8217; activity is critical for acute hepatitis diagnosis, but remains a challenge due to the dynamic and transient nature of H  2  S. Here, we report a H  2  S&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared afterglow/MRI bimodal probe  F1  &#8208;GdNP, which shows an &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; MRI signal and &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; afterglow signal toward H  2  S.  F1  &#8208;GdNP shows fast response, high sensitivity and specificity toward H  2  S, permitting afterglow imaging of H  2  S and evaluation of cystathionine  &#947;  &#8208;lyase&#8217;s activity in living mice. We further employ the high spatial&#8208;resolution MRI signal of  F1  &#8208;GdNP to track its delivery and accumulation in liver. Importantly,  F1  &#8208;GdNP offers a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR = 86.2 &#177; 12.0) to sensitively report on the increased hepatic H  2  S level in the acute hepatitis mice via afterglow imaging, which correlated well with the upregulated CSE activity in the liver, showcasing the good potential of  F1  &#8208;GdNP for monitoring of acute hepatitis process in vivo.</dc:description>

A new perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation protocol debuts: Consecutive triple fluorinations of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) generate (CF3)3C&#8722; species, which enables efficient nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation of various electrophiles. The C(CF3)3&#8208;containing products can be successfully applied in 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging.







Abstract
Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF3)3C&#8722; species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated product was successfully applied in 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.

         <title>On the Unexpectedly High Capacitance of the Metal Nanoparticle/Water Interface &#8211; Molecular Level Insights into the Electrical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrical double&#8208;layer plays a key role in important interfacial electrochemical processes from catalysis to energy stor&#8208;age and corrosion. Therefore, understanding its structure is crucial for the progress of sustainable technologies. We extract new physico&#8208;chemical information on the capacitance and structure of the electrical double&#8208;layer of platinum and gold nanoparticles at the molecular level, employing single nanoparticle electrochemistry. We reveal that the charge storage ability of the solid/liquid interface is larger by one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude than predicted by the traditional mean&#8208;field models of the double&#8208;layer such as the Gouy&#8208;Chapman&#8208;Stern&#8208;model. Performing Molecular Dynamics simulations, we investigate the possible relationship between the measured high capacitance and adsorption strength of the water adlayer formed at the metal surface. These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions as innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of Hexagonal Column Interpenetrated Spheres from Plant Polyphenol/Cationic Surfactants and Their Application as Antimicrobial Molecular Banks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial infections has become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Developing long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial materials becomes an urgent need. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high  in vitro  antimicrobial efficiency ( &gt; 99 %) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Triplet Generation Promoted via Spiro&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro&#8208;linked bichromophoric molecular systems are superior for triplet excited state generation. First, the two chromophores are tethered into a close proximity not accessible via alternative linkage, promoting spiro&#8208;conjugation mediated charge&#8208;transfer (CT). Second, the spiro&#8208;orthogonality inhibit FRET&#8208;type non&#8208;radiative deactivation and high rigidity largely suppresses vibronic energy dissipation. An intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant of 1.0&#215;10  11  s  &#8208;1  was previously registered with a spiro&#8208;bis&#8208;benzophenone scaffold. We envisage that triplet generation efficiency could be further enhanced by stabilizing the spiro&#8208;CT state and rationally designed a family of spiro&#8208;compounds (SCTs), which consist of electron&#8208;rich diphenyl ether as the spiro&#8208;CT donor and electron&#8208;deficient dinaphthyl ketone as the spiro&#8208;CT acceptor. Through fine&#8208;tuning of the energy level between the CT and high energy triplet states, near&#8208;unity triplet generation quantum yield was achieved and the underlying ISC mechanism is revealed by using ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Finally, potential triplet sensitizing application was demonstrated in SCTs. Our findings suggest that spiro&#8208;bichromophoric molecular system with an enhanced spiro&#8208;charge transfer warrants efficient triplet generation and represents a powerful design strategy of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet sensitizers with predictable ISC property.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibitor&#8208;Mediated Structural Transition in a Minimal Amyloid Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fundamental clinical importance of amyloid fibril formation, its mechanism is still enigmatic. Crystallography of minimal amyloid models was a milestone in understanding of the architecture and biological activities of amyloid fibers. However, the crystal structure of ultimate dipeptide&#8208;based amyloids is not yet reported. Herein, we present the crystal structure of a typical amyloid&#8208;forming minimal dipeptide, Ac&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;NH2 (Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2), showing a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. The simplicity of the structure helped in investigating amyloid&#8208;inhibition using crystallography, never previously reported for larger peptide models. Interestingly, in the presence of an inhibitor, the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix). This study promotes our understanding of the mechanism of amyloid formation and of the structural transitions that occur during the inhibition process in a most fundamental model.</dc:description>

HEXS/PDF of each complex in acetonitrile solution confirms the pairwise interactions in the local coordination sphere of each metal center as well as the metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal interactions separated by over 12 &#197;. The metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal distance detected in solution is compared with that from the crystal structure and molecular models to confirm that distortions to the metal bridging ligand are unique to the solid state. This work presents the first example of observing sub&#8208;&#197; conformational difference by direct comparison of solution phase and solid&#8208;state structures and shows the potential for HEXS/PDF in the determination of solution structure of single molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co3d and O2p Band Centers to Inhibit Oxygen Escape for Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode. The oxygen escape is significantly inhibited by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band centers and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping, which enables a stable cycling of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 delivers a high capacity but sharp fading is a critical issue, and the capacity decay mechanism is also poorly understood. Herein, we clarify that the escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2. We propose the inhibition of the oxygen escape for achieving stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band center and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping. This enhances the ionicity of the Co&#8722;O bond and the redox activity of Co and improves cation migration reversibility. The inhibition of oxygen escape suppresses the formation of Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 and maintains the surface structure integrity. Mg acts as a pillar, providing a stable and enlarged channel for fast Li+ intercalation/extraction. The modulated LiCoO2 shows almost zero strain and achieves a record capacity retention at 4.6&#8197;V: 92&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1C and 86.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5C.

         <title>Targetable Conformationally Restricted Cyanines Enable Photon&#8208;Count&#8208;Limited Applications**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern fluorescence&#8208;based methods put intense demands on probe molecules. Here we report conformationally restrained cyanines suitable for biomolecule labeling. These efforts establish contexts in which reduced cyanine isomerization leads to a significant enhance in photon output.







Abstract
Cyanine dyes are exceptionally useful probes for a range of fluorescence&#8208;based applications, but their photon output can be limited by trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis photoisomerization. We recently demonstrated that appending a ring system to the pentamethine cyanine ring system improves the quantum yield and extends the fluorescence lifetime. Here, we report an optimized synthesis of persulfonated variants that enable efficient labeling of nucleic acids and proteins. We demonstrate that a bifunctional sulfonated tertiary amide significantly improves the optical properties of the resulting bioconjugates. These new conformationally restricted cyanines are compared to the parent cyanine derivatives in a range of contexts. These include their use in the plasmonic hotspot of a DNA&#8208;nanoantenna, in single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications, far&#8208;red fluorescence&#8208;lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). These efforts define contexts in which eliminating cyanine isomerization provides meaningful benefits to imaging performance.

         <title>Targeted Enrichment of Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Assemblies in Cancer Cell Lysosomes Turns Immunologically Cold Tumors Hot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) inducer, which can specifically accumulate in cancer cell lysosomes for evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD) and converting immunologically cold tumors to hot.







Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death induced by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) has recently attracted increasing attention. However, nearly no studies show that currently available LMP inducers can evoke immunogenic cell death (ICD) or convert immunologically cold tumors to hot. Herein, we report a LMP inducer named TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY, which can respond to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leading to formation of nanoassembies along with fluorescence and singlet oxygen turn&#8208;on. TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY tends to accumulate in ALP&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell lysosomes as well as induce LMP and rupture of lysosomal membranes to massively evoke ICD. Such LMP&#8208;induced ICD effectively converts immunologically cold tumors to hot as evidenced by abundant CD8+ and CD4+ T cells infiltration into the cold tumors. Exposure of ALP&#8208;catalyzed nanoassemblies in cancer cell lysosomes to light further intensifies the processes of LMP, ICD and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor conversion. This work thus builds a new bridge between lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Stabilizing MXene by Hydration Chemistry in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydration chemistry of inorganic salts is utilized to decrease the attack of MXene by free water and oxygen molecules in aqueous solution. This approach can prolong the MXene shelf life to up to 400&#8197;days with negligible loss of surface chemistry and bulk carrier properties.







Abstract
MXenes attract interest in diverse fields but suffer from fast structural degradation by attacking of dissolved oxygen and water molecules in aqueous solution. This drawback hinders the long&#8208;term storage, applications and understanding of the chemical nature of MXenes. Herein, we report a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally sustainable way for long&#8208;term storage of MXenes in aqueous solution by hydration chemistry of nontoxic inorganic salts. The attacking of MXene by free water and dissolved oxygen molecules is inhibited by decreasing the water activity, which simultaneously lowers the dissolved oxygen concentration, of saline solution. As a result, the storage life of MXene can be prolonged to up to 400&#8197;days at ambient conditions without loss of intrinsic surface chemistry and bulk carrier properties. Over 90&#8201;% of salt protectant can be recycled by simply evaporating the final waste liquor after fully extracting the MXene to minimize the waste discharge and processing cost. This work offers a commercializable approach with high cost&#8208;effectiveness, processing sustainability and environmental benefit for extending the shelf life of MXenes.

         <title>Oil&#8211;Water&#8211;Oil Triphase Synthesis of Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on a phase engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs). A favourable reaction region with moderate monomer concentration is achieved in the middle water phase. The resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs show potential for ultrathin biogas separation membranes.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs) with long&#8208;range ordered and mono&#8208;dispersed ionic groups hold great potential in many advanced applications. Considering the inherent drawbacks of oil&#8211;water biphase method, herein, we explore an oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on phase engineering strategy for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of iCOFNs. The middle water phase serves as a confined reaction region, and the two oil phases are reservoirs for storing and supplying monomers to the water phase. A large aqueous space and low monomer concentration lead to the anisotropic gradual growth of iCOFNs into few&#8208;layer thickness, large lateral size, and high crystallinity. Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra&#8208;high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect&#8208;free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.

         <title>A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;&#8208;Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A crystalline carbazolylaluminylene with a monocoordinated aluminium atom featuring a lone pair of electrons and two vacant orbitals has been isolated at room temperature. The coordination behavior of this aluminylene towards transition metal centers is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene and alumanyl complexes with diverse coordination modes in a one&#8208;step process.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N&#8208;aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene 2&#8201;b. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of 2&#8201;b towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes 3&#8211;6 with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the tri&#8208;active ambiphilic Al center in 2&#8201;b can behave as: 1.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; 2.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating, &#963;&#8208;accepting and &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; and 3.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#963;&#8208;accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of 2&#8201;b with IDippCuCl (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu&#8208;alumanyl complex 8. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Alkyl Iodides Enabled by Aryl Radical Activation of Carbon&#8211;Iodine Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aryl radical activation strategy has been developed that can engage unactivated alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The strategy is based on the largely overlooked yet highly efficient reactivity of aryl radicals to abstract iodine atoms from alkyl iodides.







Abstract
The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8208;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.

         <title>Flower&#8208;Like Colloidal Particles through Precipitation Polymerization of Redox&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flower&#8208;like particles of a redox&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline mixture prepared by precipitation polymerization are reported. The influences of monomer composition, polymerization temperature, and solvent on the particle shape are investigated. The shapes formed in the early stage of polymerization remain unchanged. Under reducing conditions, the flower&#8208;like particles are degraded much more rapidly than the spherical particles due to their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of monodisperse, flower&#8208;like, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles by precipitation polymerization of a LC mixture consisting of benzoic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylates and disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates. Introduction of a minor amount of redox&#8208;responsive disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates (&#8804;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) induced the formation of flower&#8208;like shapes. The shape of the particles can be tuned from flower&#8208; to disk&#8208;like to spherical by elevating the polymerization temperature. The solvent environment also has a pronounced effect on the particle size. Time&#8208;resolved TEM reveals that the final particle morphology was formed in the early stages of the polymerization and that subsequent polymerization resulted in continued particle growth without affecting the morphology. Finally, the degradation of the particles under reducing conditions was much faster for flower&#8208;like particles than for spherical particles, likely a result of their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Iridium Clusters Stabilized on Amorphous Bimetal Borides Array for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on an amorphous metal boride array is reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induces the formation of high&#8208;valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ 18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.

         <title>Fire&#8208;Retardant, Stable&#8208;Cycling and High&#8208;Safety Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Safety always a topic of concern after reports of devices catching fire due to battery failure. Using non&#8208;flammable electrolyte as an ultimate solution is difficult to be applied to commercial batteries because of various problems such as poor compatibility, high viscosity and so on. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with excellent comprehensive performance, and applied it to sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells with different promising materials.







Abstract
The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt;85&#8201;% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7&#8201;%).

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Acidic PtIr Multipods Enable High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIr multipods with low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries. The low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms on the PtIr surface entails a down&#8208;shifting of the d&#8208;band center, which brings low oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction and oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction overpotentials.







Abstract
The sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics concomitant with the high overpotentials and parasitic reactions from cathodes and solvents is the major challenge in aprotic lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. Herein, PtIr multipods with a low Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms are reported as an advanced cathode for improving overpotentials and stabilities. DFT calculations disclose that electrons have a strong disposition to transfer from Ir to Pt, since Pt has a higher electronegativity than Ir, resulting in a lower Lewis acidity of the Pt atoms than that on the pure Pt surface. The low Lewis acidity of Pt atoms on the PtIr surface entails a high electron density and a down&#8208;shifting of the d&#8208;band center, thereby weakening the binding energy towards intermediates (LiO2), which is the key in achieving low oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction (ORR) and oxygen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction (OER) overpotentials. The Li&#8211;O2 cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low overall discharge/charge overpotential (0.44&#8197;V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based cathodes.

The Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell based on PtIr electrodes exhibits a very low overall discharge/charge overpotential (0.44&#8197;V) and an excellent cycle life (180 cycles), outperforming the bulk of reported noble-metal-based cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface chelation induced by pyridine&#8208;based polymer for efficient and durable air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer doping is a significant approach to precisely control nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites and enhance electronic quality in perovskite solar cells (PSC) prepared in air. Here, a brand&#8208;new self&#8208;healing polysiloxane (SHP) with dynamic 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxamide (PDCA) coordination units and plenty of hydrogen bonds was designed and incorporated into perovskite films. PDCA units, showing strong intermolecular Pb  2+  &#8208;N  amido  , I  &#8208;  &#8208;N  pyridyl  , and Pb  2+  &#8208;O  amido  coordination interactions, were expected to enhance crystallinity and passivate the grain boundary. In addition, abundant hydrogen bonds in SHP afforded the self&#8208;healing of cracks at grain boundaries for fatigue PSCs. Significantly, the doped device demonstrated a champion efficiency of 19.50% with inconspicuous hysteresis, almost rivaling those achieved in control atmosphere. This strategy of heterocyclic&#8208;based macromolecular doping in PSCs will pave a way for realizing efficient and durable crystalline semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Metal Catalysis towards 7&#8208;Oxostaurosporine and Its Non&#8208;Natural Septanose Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report sequential metal catalysis towards indolocarbazole glycosides. The signature event is highlighted by i) Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed addition of indolocarbazole to alkoxyallene combined with ring closing metathesis; ii) Ru&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective olefin migration; iii) Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization to build the bicyclic core structure of the target compounds. This approach gave access to both natural pyranose&#8208; and non&#8208;natural septanose glycosides. A short formal synthesis of 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine was achieved via this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysics of perylene diimide dianions and their application in photoredox catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron reduced forms of perylene diimides (PDIs) are luminescent closed&#8208;shell species whose photochemical properties are underexplored. Our work demonstrates that both water&#8208;soluble and lipophilic variants of PDI dianions have electronically excited states with nanosecond lifetimes that are very strongly reducing. Consequently, thermodynamically demanding photocatalytic reductive dehalogenations and reductive C&#8208;O bond cleavage reactions of lignin model compounds are possible from these excited states under irradiation with green light. Sodium dithionite acts as a convenient reductant, either in aqueous solution or in biphasic water&#8208;acetonitrile mixtures in the presence of a phase transfer reagent. A key point of our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is that straightforward (single) excitation of PDI dianions with green photons provides an excited state that is similarly or more reducing than the much shorter&#8208;lived excited states of PDI monoanions, which are typically accessible after consecutive (biphotonic) excitation with two blue photons. Furthermore, our work introduces the concept of multi&#8208;electron reduction of a photocatalyst by a sacrificial reagent (Na2S2O4) prior to its irradiation with low&#8208;energy photons as a means of generating highly reactive excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploiting Cooperative Catalysis for the On&#8208;surface Synthesis of Linear Heteroaromatic Polymers via Selective C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regiospecific C&#8208;H activation is a promising approach to achieve extended polymers with tailored structures. While a recent on&#8208;surface synthetic approach has enabled regioselective homocoupling of heteroaromatic molecules, only small oligomers have been achieved. Herein, selective C H activation for dehydrogenative C&#8722;C couplings of hexaazatriphenylene by Scholl reaction is reported for the first time. By combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we revealed the formation of one&#8208;dimensional polymers with a double&#8208;chain structure. The details of the growth process are rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, pointing out a cooperative catalytic action of Na and Ag adatoms in steering the C&#8208;H selectivity for the polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Channel Structure&#8211;Diffusivity Relationships in Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of improved zeolite materials for applications in separation and catalysis requires understanding of mass transport. Herein, diffusion of single molecules is tracked in the straight and sinusoidal channels of the industrially relevant ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. Distinct motion behaviors are observed in zeolite channels with the same geometry, suggesting heterogeneous guest&#8211;host interactions. Quantification of the diffusion heterogeneities in the sinusoidal and straight channels suggests that the geometry of zeolite channels dictates the mobility and motion behavior of the guest molecules, resulting in diffusion anisotropy. The study of hierarchical zeolites shows that the addition of secondary pore networks primarily enhances the diffusivity of sinusoidal zeolite channels, and thus alleviating the diffusion limitations of microporous zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Electrical and Magnetic Properties of Layered Conductive Metal&#8722;Organic Framework With Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) material Cu  3  (C  6  O  6  )  2  by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.70 &#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of Cu(II) within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Indole Diterpenes Paspalicine, Paspalinine, and Paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes (IDTs) are structurally complex mycotoxins with unique tremorgenic activity. Reported are asymmetric total syntheses of three paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene. Our synthesis features (1) green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for efficient construction of FG rings (75% yield) and (2) cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings (72% yield). Other highlights include four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions (Stille, aza&#8208;Wacker, Suzuki, and Heck) to forge the BE rings and the installation of two continuous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via reductive ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane and &#945;&#8208;methylation of conjugate ester. Our new synthetic strategy is expected to be applicable to the chemical synthesis of other paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs and will facilitate the bioactivity studies of these agriculturally and pharmacologically important IDTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much attention because of its potential for electronic and biological applications. Herein, we report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright CPL by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An a&#8208;cyclodextrin (  CyD  ) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8208;cyclodextrins (  PCD  s) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#949; ~ 10  5  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  ), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|  g  lum  | ~ 10  &#8211;2  ), and quantum yield (  &#934;  f  ~ 0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (  B  CPL  ) reached 340 M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  . Comprehensive photophysical and chiroptical studies of the  PCD  s with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the  CyD  with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing A New Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material, &#223;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 Inspired by the Phase Transition of the BaB2O4 (BBO) Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals play a significant role in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing a new IR NLO crystal remains a huge challenge because of the unpredictability of inorganic structures. Herein, inspired by phase transformation of the famous BaB2O4  (BBO) crystal, a temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetric (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4  to uncover a new NCS ternary chalcogenide,  &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4  which can exhibit the well&#8208;balanced NLO properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matching SHG response (~0.6&#215;AgGaS2  ), high LDT (10&#215;AgGaS2  ), and large birefringence (  &#8710;n  = 0.18 in the visible region). Therefore,  &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4  will be a promising IR NLO crystal. The analysis for the structure&#8208;property relationship shows that the excellent NLO properties of  &#946;  &#8208;BaGa2Se4  mainly originate from edge&#8208;sharing GaSe4  tetrahedral chains, which are different from B3O6  groups in  &#946;&#8208;BBO and respect a new direction for the design of IR NLO crystals. So, we believe that the current research provides not only a new IR NLO crystal but also some insights for the design of new IR NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C(sp3)&#8208;N Bond Cleavage of N,N&#8208;Dialkyl Tertiary Amines with the Loss of a Large Alkyl Group via an SN1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polar disconnection of the C(sp3)&#8208;N bond of N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tertiary amines via ammonium species conventionally favored the loss of the smaller alkyl group by an SN2 displacement, while selective C(sp3)&#8208;N bond cleavage by cutting off the larger alkyl group is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present a novel Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation, proceeding through an alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation and consecutive diamination with a tertiary hydroxylamine by cleaving its N&#8208;O bond and one C(sp3)&#8208;N bond, for the rapid assembly of tricyclic indoles in a single&#8208;step transformation. Noteworthy, experimental results indicated that large tert&#8208;butyl and benzyl groups were selectively cleaved via an SN1 pathway, in the presence of a smaller alkyl group (Me, Et, iPr). Under the guidance of this new finding, tricyclic indoles bearing a removable alkyl group could be exclusively obtained by using a (a&#8208;methyl)benzyl/benzyl or tert&#8208;butyl/2&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl mixed amino source.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Biobased Synthesis of Acrylic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Petrochemical based polymers, paints and coatings are cornerstones of modern industry but our future sustainable society demands for greener processes and renewable feedstock materials. A challenge is to access platform monomers from biomass resources while integrating the principles of Green Chemistry in their chemical synthesis. Here, we present a synthesis route starting from biomassderived furfural towards the commonly used monomers maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, implementing environmentally benign photooxygenation, aerobic oxidation and ethenolysis reactions. Maleic anhydride and acrylic acid, transformed into sodium acrylate, were isolated in yields of 85% (2 steps) and 81% (4 steps), respectively. With minimal waste and high atom efficiency, this biobased route provides a viable alternative to access key monomers.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Many dyes suffer from fast non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, thereby showing only short&#8208;lived excited states and weak photoluminescence. Here we show a pronounced fluorescence enhancement for a weakly fluorescent merocyanine (MC) dye by being stacked to other dyes in hetero&#8208;folda&#8208;trimer architectures. By means of fluorescence spectroscopy (lifetime, quantum yield) the fluorescence enhancement was explained by a decrease of the non&#8208;radiative decay rate due to the rigidifying foldamer architecture and a compared to homo&#8208;trimers increased radiative rate for the hetero&#8208;trimers due to a non&#8208;forbidden lowest exciton state. This folding&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (FIFE) for specific sequences of &#960;&#8208;stacked dyes points at a viable strategy toward improved fluorophores that relates to the approach used by nature in the green fluorescent protein (GFP).</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by&#160;Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>From Esters to Ketones via a Photoredox&#8208;Assisted Reductive Acyl Cross&#8208;Coupling (PARAC) Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two different carboxylic acid esters towards the synthesis of ketones via a photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling (PARAC) strategy is developed. A variety of aryl, 1  o  , 2  o  , 3  o  &#8208;alkyl 2pyridyl esters can act as acyl electrophiles while  N  (acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) act as 1  o  , 2  o  , 3  o  &#8208;radical precursors. Our PARAC strategy provides an alternative and reliable way to synthesize various sterically congested 3  o  &#8208;3  o  , 3  o  &#8208;2  o  , and aryl3  o  ketones under mild and highly unified conditions, which have been otherwise difficult to access. The combined experimental and computational studies identified a Ni(0)/Ni(I)/Ni(III) pathway for ketone formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures for efficient CO2 chemical fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into value&#8208;added organics is regarded as a competitive and viable method in large scale industrial production, during which the catalysts with promoting CO  2  activation ability are needed. Herein, we proposed an in&#8208;plane heterostructure strategy to construct Lewis acid&#8211;base sites for efficient CO  2  activation. By taking ultrathin in&#8208;plane Cu  2  O/Cu heterostructures as a prototype, we show that Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on heterointerface can facilitate a mixed C and O dual coordination on surface, which not only strengthen CO  2  adsorption, but also effectively activate the inert molecules. As revealed by  in&#8208;situ  diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and quasi  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lewis acid&#8208;base sites could readily activate CO  2  to &#8226;CO  2  &#8211;  species, which is the key intermediate radical for CO  2  fixation. As a result, abundant Lewis acid&#8211;base sites endow Cu  2  O/Cu nanosheets with excellent performances for dimethyl carbonate generation, a high conversion yield of 28% with nearly 100% selectivity under mild conditions. This study provides a model structure for CO  2  fixation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Copper Catalysis for the Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles represent one of the largest groups of organic moieties with significant medicinal, chemical, and industrial applications. Herein, we report the discovery and development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, synergistic excited&#8208;state copper catalysis using a combination of Cu(IPr)I as a catalyst and rac&#8208;BINAP as a ligand, which produces more than 10 distinct classes of heterocycles. The reaction tolerates a broad array of functional groups and complex molecular scaffolds, including derivatives of peptides, natural products, and marketed drugs. Preliminary mechanistic investigation suggests in situ generations of [Cu(BINAP)  2  ]  +  and [Cu(IPr)  2  ]  +  catalysts that work cooperatively under visible&#8208;light irradiation to facilitate catalytic carbo&#8208;aroylation of unactivated alkenes, affording a wide range of useful heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Enabled Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intramolecular noncovalent interactions (INIs) have served as a powerful strategy for accessing organic semiconductors with enhanced backbone planarity and charge transport properties. Herein, we apply the INI strategy for developing dopant&#8208;free hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) by constructing two small&#8208;molecular HTMs featuring an INI&#8208;integrated backbone for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Upon incorporating noncovalent S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction into their simple&#8208;structured backbones consisting of a bithiophene core and two triphenylamine ends, the resulting HTMs, BTORA and BTORCNA, showed self&#8208;planarized backbones, tuned energy levels, enhanced thermal properties, appropriate film morphology, and effective defect passivation. More importantly, the high film crystallinity enables the materials with substantial hole mobilities, thus rendering them as promising dopant&#8208;free HTMs. Consequently, the BTORCNA&#8208;based inverted PVSCs delivered a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 21.10% with encouraging long&#8208;term device stability, significantly outperforming the devices based on BTRA without S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction (18.40%). This work offers a general and practical approach to designing charge transporting layers with high intrinsic mobilities for high&#8208;performance PVSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Recurring Chemogenetic Switch for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a revolutionary cancer treatment, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications such as cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. Their mitigation desires controllable activation of CAR&#8208;T cells that is achievable through regulatory display of CARs. By embedding the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCV&#8208;NS3) between the single&#8208;chain variable fragment (scFv) and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv on CAR&#8208;T cells was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV&#8208;NS3 inhibitor asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a practically recurring chemical switch.  We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.</dc:description>

By embedding the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCV-NS3) between the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti-CD19 scFv on CAR-T cells was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV-NS3 inhibitor asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti-CD19 scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a practically recurring chemical switch.  We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate modulation of CAR-T activation during cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on an Organic Antimony(III) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free hybrids with higher stability and lower toxicity than those of three&#8208;dimensional lead perovskites, organic antimony(III) halides show great application potential in opt&#8208;electronic field owing to diverse topologies along with exceptional optical properties. We report herein an antimony(III) hybrid (MePPh  3  )  2  SbCl  5  with a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structure, which exhibits brilliant orange emission peaked at 593 nm with near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yield (99.4%). The characterization of photophysical properties demonstrates that the broadband emission with a microsecond lifetime (3.24 &#956;s) arises from self&#8208;trapped emission (STE). Electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on neat and doped films of (MePPh  3  )  2  SbCl  5  were fabricated. The doped devices show significant improvement in comparison to non&#8208;doped OLEDs. Owing to the much improved surface morphology and balanced carrier transport in light&#8208;emitting layers of doped devices, the peak luminance, current efficiency (CE) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are boosted from 82 cd/m  2  to 3500 cd/m  2  , 1.1 cd/A to 6.8 cd/A, and 0.7% to 3.1% relative to non&#8208;doped devices, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production via the Construction of Robust Multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF Composite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Titanium metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ti&#8208;MOFs), as an appealing type of artificial photocatalysts, have shown great potentials in the field of solar energy conversion due to their well&#8208;studied photo&#8208;redox activity similar to TiO  2  and good optical responsiveness of linkers serving as the antenna to absorb visible&#8208;light. Although enormous efforts have been dedicated to developing Ti&#8208;MOFs with high photocatalytic activity, their solar energy conversion performances are still poor. Herein, a covalent&#8208;integrated strategy has been implemented to construct a series of multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF hybrid materials, PdTCPP&#11814;PCN&#8208;415(NH  2  )/TpPa (composites 1, 2, and 3), featuring excellent visible&#8208;light utilization, suitable band gap, and high surface area for photocatalytic H  2  production. Notably, the resulting composites demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic H  2  evolution performance, especially for the composite 2 with the maximum H  2  evolution rate of 13.98 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  (turn&#8208;over frequency (TOF) = 227 h  &#8208;1  ), which is much higher than the prototypical counterparts, PdTCPP&#11814;PCN&#8208;415(NH  2  ) (0.21 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and TpPa (6.51 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ). Our work thereby suggests a new approach to develop highly efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic H  2  evolution reaction and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalizations of Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids, into functionalized alkanes via deoxygenation would be highly desirable from a sustainability perspective and very enabling in chemical synthesis. This review covers the recent methodology development in carbonyl and carboxyl deoxygenative functionalizations, highlighting some typical and significant contributions in this field. These advances will be categorized based on types of bond formation, and in each part, selected examples will be discussed from their generalized mechanistic perspectives. Four summarized reactivity modes of aldehydes and ketones during the deoxygenation, namely, bis&#8208;electrophile, carbenoid, bis&#8208;nucleophile and alkyl radical, are presented, while the carboxylic acids are deoxygenated mainly via activated carbonyl or acetal intermediates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe herein the self&#8208;assembly synthesis of an octanuclear Co(II) [2]catenane {[Co4L6]2}16+ formed by the mechanical interlocking of two [Co4L6]8+ rectangles of unprecedented topology. Subtle manipulation of the synthetic conditions allows the isolation of a mixed valence [Co2III/Co2II]10+ non&#8208;catenated rectangle. The Co(II) centers in the [2]catenane exhibit slow relaxation of their magnetic moment, i.e. single&#8208;molecule magnet properties, dominated by quantum tunneling and Raman relaxation processes. This work shows that metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry can precisely control the organization single&#8208;molecule magnets in topologically complex arrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Elastic Interconnected Porous Hydrogels through Self&#8208;Assembled Templating for Solar Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial evaporation using porous hydrogels has demonstrated highly effective solar evaporation performance under natural sunlight to ensure an affordable clean water supply. However, it remains challenging to realize scalable and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use hydrogel materials with durable mechanical properties. Here, self&#8208;assembled templating (SAT) is developed as a simple yet effective method to fabricate large&#8208;scale elastic hydrogel evaporators with excellent desalination performance. The highly interconnected porous structure of the hydrogels with low tortuosity and tunable pore size enables high level of tunability on the water transport rate. With superior elasticity, the porous hydrogels are easy to process with a rapid shape recovery after being rolled, folded, and twisted over hundred times, and exhibit highly effective and stable evaporation with an evaporation rate of ~ 2.8 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  and ~ 90% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. It is anticipated that this SAT strategy, without the typical need for freeze&#8208;drying, will accelerate the industrialization of hydrogel solar evaporators for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fighting Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria : Promising Strategies Orchestrated by Molecularly Imprinted Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infections caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, making them one of the major public health problems of our time. We highlight how one unique material  ,  molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), can orchestrate several strategies to fight this major societal issue. MIPs are tailor&#8208;made biomimetic supramolecular receptors that recognize and bind target molecules with a high affinity and selectivity, comparable to those of antibodies. While research on MIPs for combatting cancer has been constantly flourishing, comprehensive work on their involvement in combatting resistant superbugs has been rather scarce. This review aims at filling this gap. We will describe what are the causes of bacterial resistance and at which level MIPs can deploy their weapons. MIPs&#8217; targets can be biofilm constituents, quorum sensing messengers, bacterial surface proteins and antibiotic&#8208;deactivating enzymes, among others. We will conclude on the current challenges and future developments in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Dependent Ordering Transition of Highly Crystalline Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25499-25507, November 22, 2021. </description>

When switching the alkyl linkers from C12H24 to C16H32 in double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers, perylene bisimide side units exhibited order phase transition from disordered structures to ordered H&#8208;aggregation, which is strongly correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.







Abstract
We developed a series of highly crystalline double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). These polymers contain conjugated backbones as electron donor and pendant perylene bisimide units (PBIs) as electron acceptor. PBIs are connected to the backbone via alkyl units varying from hexyl (C6H12) to eicosyl (C20H40) as flexible linkers. For double&#8208;cable polymers with short linkers, the PBIs tend to stack in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head fashion, resulting in large d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 64&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P12 with C12H24 linker) along the lamellar stacking direction. When the length of the linker groups is longer than a certain length, the PBIs instead adopt a more ordered packing likely via H&#8208;aggregation, resulting in short d&#8208;spacings (e.g. 50&#8197;&#197; for the polymer P16 with C16H32 linker). This work highlights the importance of linker length on the molecular packing of the acceptor units and the influences on the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Interfacial Layer for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A slide&#8208;ring polymer with a high stiffness, high toughness and excellent fracture resistance is designed to adapt its shape to dynamic electrode volume variations and stabilize the lithium anode upon cycling.







Abstract
The plating/stripping of Li dendrites can fracture the static solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cause significant dynamic volume variations in the Li anode, which give rise to poor cyclability and severe safety hazards. Herein, a tough polymer with a slide&#8208;ring structure was designed as a self&#8208;adaptive interfacial layer for Li anodes. The slide&#8208;ring polymer with a dynamically crosslinked network moves freely while maintaining its toughness and fracture resistance, which allows it can to dissipate the tension induced by Li dendrites on the interphase layer. Moreover, the slide&#8208;ring polymer is highly stretchable, elastic, and displays an ultrafast self&#8208;healing ability, which allows even pulverized Li to remain coalesced without disintegrating upon consecutive cycling. The Li anodes demonstrate greatly improved suppression of Li dendrite formation, as evidenced by the high critical current density (6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable cycling for the full cells with high&#8208;areal capacity LiFePO4, high&#8208;voltage NCM, and S cathodes.

         <title>A Titanium Nitride Nanozyme for pH&#8208;Responsive and Irradiation&#8208;Enhanced Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>

N&#8208;doping significantly improves the peroxidase (POD) activity of titanium&#8208;based nanozymes. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) showed enhanced POD activity under NIR laser irradiation due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and temperature effects. Combined with glucose oxidase in liposomes, a TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;based nanoplatform (TLGp) showed an excellent antitumor activity under NIR&#8208;mediated mild thermal conditions through its cascade&#8208;catalytic activity.







Abstract
Nanozyme&#8208;based catalytic tumor therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic&#8208;atom doping and irradiation. Nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes, which was shown experimentally and theoretically. Based on the excellent NIR&#8208;adsorption&#8208;induced surface plasmon resonance and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping, and irradiation&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy enables an effective tumor inhibition by TLGp with minimal side effects in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Elimination of Grain Boundary Defects in Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework ZIF&#8208;95 Membrane via Solvent&#8208;Free Secondary Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25463-25467, November 22, 2021. </description>

A solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is developed for facile synthesis of highly oriented and well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;95 membranes. The solvent&#8208;free secondary growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also reduce solvent&#8208;induced intercrystalline defects, leading to a significant enhancement of the H2 permselectivity for the separation of hydrogen from larger gas molecules compared to solvothermal synthesis.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework membranes are usually prepared by in situ or secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel. The use of organic solvents may cause safety and environmental problems and produce solvent&#8208;induced defects. Here, highly oriented and permselective ZIF&#8208;95 membranes are prepared for the first time via a solvent&#8208;free secondary growth method. The solvent&#8208;free growth is not only helpful to control the membrane microstructure and thickness, but also to reduce the intercrystalline defects. In case of solvent&#8208;free growth, a perfectly oriented structure leads to an outstanding reduction of intercrystalline defects and transport resistances. For the separation of equimolar binary gas mixtures by using the highly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 are 184 and 140, respectively, with H2 permeance of over 1.9&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 which are much higher than those of the randomly oriented ZIF&#8208;95 membrane.

Stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG, 1) with Cs metal affords the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and triply&#8208;reduced nanosized carbanions. In&#8208;depth X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and comprehensive theoretical investigations of this series of negatively charged nanographenes reveal a very complex response and core flexibility upon multi&#8208;electron charging.







Abstract
The stepwise chemical reduction of a molecular warped nanographene (WNG) having a negatively curved &#960;&#8208;surface and defined C80H30 composition with Cs metal used as the reducing and complexing agent allowed the isolation of three different reduced states with one, two, and three electrons added to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. This provided a unique series of nanosized carbanions with increasing negative charge for in&#8208;depth structural analysis of consequences of controlled electron charging of non&#8208;planar nanographenes, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational tools. The 3D molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps identified the negative charge localization at the central part of the WNG surface where selective coordination of Cs+ ions is confirmed crystallographically. In&#8208;depth theoretical investigation revealed a complex response of the WNG to the stepwise electron acquisition. The extended and contorted &#960;&#8208;surface of the WNG undergoes subtle swinging distortions that are accompanied by notable changes in the electronic structure and site&#8208;dependent aromaticity of the resulting carbanions.

Red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with high PLQY (65.5&#8201;%) were obtained from aliphatic precursors by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) peak, was constructed and resulted in a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB.







Abstract
Miniaturized solid&#8208;state lasers with a single longitudinal mode are vital for various photonic applications. Here we prepare red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (CDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 65.5&#8201;% by combining graphitic nitrogen doping and surface modification. High&#8208;concentration doping alters the CDs&#8217; emission from blue to red, while the electron&#8208;donating groups and polymer coating on their surfaces improve the PLQY and photostability. The CDs exhibit excellent stimulated emission characteristics, with a low threshold of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and long gain lifetime. A planar microcavity with only one resonant mode, which fitted with the CDs&#8217; ASE peak, was constructed. Combining the CDs and microcavity produced a solid&#8208;state laser with a single longitudinal mode, a linewidth of 0.14&#8197;nm and a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 14.8&#8197;dB (Q&#8764;4600). Our results will aid the development of colorful solid&#8208;state micro/nano lasers with potential use in practical photonics.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

Iodide ions are utilized as an inhibitor for terminating the polymerization of PCN (TP&#8208;PCN). The resulting ultrathin and small&#8208;sized TP&#8208;PCN have abundant edge active sites (AEASs). They greatly enhance the O2 adsorption/activation capacity and the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) selectivity. As expected, the TP&#8208;PCN affords a remarkably increased photocatalytic H2O2 production activity.







Abstract
Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H2O2 production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2&#8201;e&#8722; ORR greatly restrict the H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions. The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H2O2 generation rate (3265.4&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O2, which optimizes O2 activation and reduces the energy barrier of H2O2 formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O2 activation in ORR for H2O2 production.

Accurate co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2: HAL and 3BP&#8208;loaded microparticles specifically target and recognize tumor cells, wherein HAL induces the biosynthesis of PpIX in mitochondria and 3BP reduces the mitochondria oxygen consumption. The precise co&#8208;localization of PpIX and O2 produces sufficient singlet oxygen to directly disrupt mitochondria, significantly improving PDT.







Abstract
Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) near to mitochondria can conquer the rigorous spatiotemporal limitations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. We simultaneously encapsulated hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray&#8208;irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria via the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway. Meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.

         <title>APEX2&#8208;based Proximity Labeling of Atox1 Identifies CRIP2 as a Nuclear Copper&#8208;binding Protein that Regulates Autophagy Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25346-25355, November 22, 2021. </description>

Seeking to overcome challenges with the identification of copper chaperone protein's binding partners, we used APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling with Atox1 as the bait to identify weak/transient protein&#8211;protein interactions. Atox1 delivers copper into the nucleus and transfers it to a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein CRIP2, and copper promotes CRIP2 degradation to induce ROS&#8208;mediated activation of autophagy.







Abstract
Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper's broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2&#8208;based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine&#8208;rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8242;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2&#8208;as well as copper&#8208;induced CRIP2 degradation&#8208;elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2&#8208;mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.

Atox1 delivers copper into the nucleus and transfers it to a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein CRIP2, and copper promotes CRIP2 degradation to induce ROS-mediated activation of autophagy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammalian cell nuclei contain copper, and cancer cells are known to accumulate aberrantly high copper levels, yet the mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation and copper's broader functional significance remain poorly understood. Here, by combining APEX2-based proximity labeling focused on the copper chaperone Atox1 with mass spectrometry we identified a previously unrecognized nuclear copper binding protein, Cysteine-rich protein 2 (CRIP2), that interacts with Atox1 in the nucleus. We show that Atox1 transfers copper to CRIP2, which induces a change in CRIP2&#8242;s secondary structure that ultimately promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of CRIP2-as well as copper-induced CRIP2 degradation-elevates ROS levels and activates autophagy in H1299 cells. Thus, our study establishes that CRIP2 as an autophagic suppressor protein and implicates CRIP2-mediated copper metabolism in the activation of autophagy in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Crystalline Covalent&#8208;Triazine&#8208;Framework Nanosheets with Electron Donor Groups for Synergistically Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25381-25390, November 22, 2021. </description>

Ultrathin crystalline 2D triazine polymer nanosheets with electron donor groups are prepared for the first time by a novel redox strategy. They demonstrate ultrahigh photocatalytic overall water splitting performance arising from the optimized band structure and improved light&#8208;responsive range from the electron donor groups introduced into the 2D ordered molecular plane.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanosheets have great potential for photocatalytic applications, however, suffer from enlarged band gap and narrowed visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range due to the quantum confinement effect. Herein, we report a novel redox strategy for efficient preparation of ultrathin crystalline amide&#8208;functionalized covalent&#8208;triazine&#8208;framework nanosheets (CTF NSs) with enhanced visible light absorption. The CTF NSs exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen (512.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and oxygen (12.37&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates much higher than that of pristine bulk CTF. Photocatalytic overall water splitting could be achieved with efficient stoichiometric H2 (5.13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and O2 (2.53&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) evolution rates under visible light irradiation. Experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that introduction of amide groups as electron donor optimized the band structure and improve its visible&#8208;light absorption, hydrophilicity and carrier separation efficiency, thus resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic performance. The well&#8208;dispersed CTF NSs could be easily cast onto a support as a thin film device and demonstrate excellent photocatalytic activity (25.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution).

Simple and selective synthesis of fluoromethylated alkenes, heterocycles, enamines and heteroarenes by using the readily available and bench&#8208;stable fluoromethylphosphonium iodide salts is described. Key to this privileged transformation is the formation of a photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complex involving the &#963;&#8208;hole effect of phosphonium salts.







Abstract
The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radicals is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Fluoromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of the &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge&#8208;transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoromethylation of a variety of alkenes.

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;Index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25391-25396, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With density functional theory, the phenomena that drive the shape selectivity of NiO particles crystallized by molten salt synthesis were studied. Trapezohedral NiO particles are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to the interaction of locally ordered alkali&#8208;chloride structures with the growing high&#8208;index oxide facets, thus acting as capping agents. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO formation is driven by the dissociative adsorption of water.







Abstract
Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings, showing that molten&#8208;salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity on NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high&#8208;index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal&#8208;oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8211;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular&#8208;level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten&#8208;salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape&#8208;engineer metal&#8208;oxide crystals.

         <title>Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25419-25427, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of proton transport within nonionic reverse micelles is dependent on the proton concentration ([H+]) and the size of the nanoconfined environment. For small reverse micelles and/or low [H+], protons diffuse via the Grotthuss mechanism (forward hopping). In larger reverse micelles and/or at high [H+], ions accumulate at the reverse micelles interface, resulting in a proton &#8220;traffic jam,&#8221; in which an oscillatory hopping mechanism becomes dominant.







Abstract
The properties of the water network in concentrated HCl acid pools in nanometer&#8208;sized reverse nonionic micelles were probed with TeraHertz absorption, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, and reactive force field simulations capable of describing proton hopping mechanisms. We identify that only at a critical micelle size of W0=9 do solvated proton complexes form in the water pool, accompanied by a change in mechanism from Grotthuss forward shuttling to one that favors local oscillatory hopping. This is due to a preference for H+ and Cl&#8722; ions to adsorb to the micelle interface, together with an acid concentration effect that causes a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which the short&#8208;circuiting of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif of the hydronium ion decreases the forward hopping rate throughout the water interior even as the micelle size increases. These findings have implications for atmospheric chemistry, biochemical and biophysical environments, and energy materials, as transport of protons vital to these processes can be suppressed due to confinement, aggregation, and/or concentration.

         <title>Plenty of Room at the Top: A Multi&#8208;Scale Understanding of nm&#8208;Resolution Polymer Patterning on 2D Materials</title>

Striped phase polydiacetylenes create 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution chemical patterns on 2D materials, well below the limits possible through most fabrication methods. A new multi&#8208;scale view of polymerization enables the design of monomers that undergo efficient on&#8208;surface polymerization, opening the door to new applications that rely on stable, near&#8208;atomic&#8208;scale chemical environments.







Abstract
Lamellar phases of alkyldiacetylenes in which the alkyl chains lie parallel to the substrate represent a straightforward means for scalable 1&#8208;nm&#8208;resolution interfacial patterning. This capability has the potential for substantial impacts in nanoscale electronics, energy conversion, and biomaterials design. Polymerization is required to set the 1&#8208;nm functional patterns embedded in the monolayer, making it important to understand structure&#8211;function relationships for these on&#8208;surface reactions. Polymerization can be observed for certain monomers at the single&#8208;polymer scale using scanning probe microscopy. However, substantial restrictions on the systems that can be effectively characterized have limited utility. Here, using a new multi&#8208;scale approach, we identify a large, previously unreported difference in polymerization efficiency between the two most widely used commercial diynoic acids. We further identify a core design principle for maximizing polymerization efficiency in these on&#8208;surface reactions, generating a new monomer that also exhibits enhanced polymerization efficiency.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Sulfur&#8208;Doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity: Effect of Iron Spin&#8208;State Tuning</title>

The enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of sulfur&#8208;doped Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts is studied from Fe spin&#8208;state tuning. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra monitoring further supported the low&#8208;spin (LS) single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of the C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for the ORR.







Abstract
Heteroatom doped atomically dispersed Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts have been found to show excellent activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure&#8208;function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)&#8208;doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe&#8208;NC materials. 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe1&#8208;NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single&#8208;Fe3+&#8208;atom of C&#8208;FeN4&#8208;S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe1&#8208;NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin&#8208;state&#8208;determined ORR.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Phosphate Cathode for High&#8208;Rate and Ultralong Cycle&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A low&#8208;strain phosphate cathode material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (KVP) nanoruler is synthesized by a facile solvothermal approach. The KVP nanorulers manifest high discharge voltage, superior rate capability, and ultralong cyclic life as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). This work would provide guidance to exploit high&#8208;performance PIB cathode materials.







Abstract
Most potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) cathode materials have deficient structural stability because of the huge radius of potassium ion, leading to inferior cycling performance. We report the controllable synthesis of a novel low&#8208;strain phosphate material K3(VO)(HV2O3)(PO4)2(HPO4) (denoted KVP) nanorulers as an efficient cathode for PIBs. The as&#8208;synthesized KVP nanoruler cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 80.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a large average working potential of 4.11&#8197;V. It also manifests an excellent rate property of 54.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity preservation of 92.1&#8201;% over 2500&#8197;cycles. The outstanding potassium storage capability of KVP nanoruler cathode originates from a low&#8208;strain K+ uptake/removal mechanism, inherent semiconductor characteristic, and small K+ migration energy barrier. The high energy density and prolonged cyclic stability of KVP nanorulers//polyaniline&#8208;intercalated layered titanate full battery verifies the superiority of KVP nanoruler cathode in PIBs.

         <title>Stabilization of the Elusive Antimony(I) Cation and Its Coordination Complexes with Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25522-25529, November 22, 2021. </description>

The elusive SbI cation has been stabilized by the 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene ligand (see structure). The bis(phosphine) not only acts as a supporting ligand, but also enables the unique two&#8208;electron reduction of the SbIII precursor in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate, leading to SbI cation. The strategically introduced nucleophilicity at the SbI site enabled the first examples of its coordination to transition metals.







Abstract
Upon stabilization by 5,6&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)acenaphthene to form compound 1, the fugitive antimony (I) cation exhibited nucleophilic behavior towards coinage metals. Compound 1 was strategically synthesized at room temperature from SbCl3, the bis(phosphine), and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate taken in a 1:2:3 ratio, whereby the bis(phosphine) plays the dual role of a reductant and a supporting ligand. The generation of 1 involves two&#8208;electron oxidation of the ligand to form a P&#8722;P bonded diphosphonium dication. Compound 1 was separated from this dication to give both products in pure form in moderate yields. Despite the overall positive charge, the SbI site in 1 was found to bind to metal centers, forming complexes with AuI, AgI and CuI. Compound 1 reduced CuII to CuI and formed a coordination complex with the resulting CuI species. The effects of the electron&#8208;rich bis(phosphine) and the constrained peri geometry in stabilizing and enhancing the nucleophilicity of 1 have been rationalized through computational studies.

We report the liquid&#8208;sate NMR spectroscopy analysis of the dimeric SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (3CLp), including its backbone assignments, to study its complex conformational regulation. Using fragment&#8208;based NMR screening, we highlighted three hotspots on the protein, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface, and we identified a non&#8208;covalent reversible inhibitor of 3CLp that has antiviral activity in infected cells.







Abstract
The main protease (3CLp) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the causative agent for the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, is one of the main targets for drug development. To be active, 3CLp relies on a complex interplay between dimerization, active site flexibility, and allosteric regulation. The deciphering of these mechanisms is a crucial step to enable the search for inhibitors. In this context, using NMR spectroscopy, we studied the conformation of dimeric 3CLp from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and monitored ligand binding, based on NMR signal assignments. We performed a fragment&#8208;based screening that led to the identification of 38 fragment hits. Their binding sites showed three hotspots on 3CLp, two in the substrate binding pocket and one at the dimer interface. F01 is a non&#8208;covalent inhibitor of the 3CLp and has antiviral activity in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected cells. This study sheds light on the complex structure&#8208;function relationships of 3CLp and constitutes a strong basis to assist in developing potent 3CLp inhibitors.

         <title>Block Copolymers Based on Ethylene and Methacrylates Using a Combination of Catalytic Chain Transfer Polymerisation (CCTP) and Radical Polymerisation</title>

Catalytic chain transfer polymerisation was used to produce methacrylic macromonomers. Those were involved in a simple radical polymerisation of ethylene to form block copolymers featuring a polyethylene segment and various polymethacrylic segments.







Abstract
Two scalable polymerisation methods are used in combination for the synthesis of ethylene and methacrylate block copolymers. &#969;&#8208;Unsaturated methacrylic oligomers (MMAn) produced by catalytic chain transfer (co)polymerisation (CCTP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA) are used as reagents in the radical polymerisation of ethylene (E) in dimethyl carbonate solvent under relatively mild conditions (80&#8197;bar, 70&#8201;&#176;C). Kinetic measurements and analyses of the produced copolymers by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques indicate that MMAn is involved in a degradative chain transfer process resulting in the formation of (MMA)n&#8208;b&#8208;PE block copolymers. Molecular modelling performed by DFT supports the overall reactivity scheme and observed selectivities. The effect of MMAn molar mass and composition is also studied. The block copolymers were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and their bulk behaviour studied by SAXS/WAXS analysis.

         <title>A Cryptic Plant Terpene Cyclase Producing Unconventional 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic C25 and C20 Terpenoids with Immunosuppressive Activity</title>

A cryptic plant terpene cyclase producing unconventional macrocyclic sesterterpenoids and diterpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Two variants producing more sesterterpenoids were engineered, and the immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was found.







Abstract
A versatile terpene synthase (LcTPS2) producing unconventional macrocyclic terpenoids was characterized from Leucosceptrum canum. Engineered Escherichia coli and Nicotiana benthamiana expressing LcTPS2 produced six 18&#8208;/14&#8208;membered sesterterpenoids including five new ones and two 14&#8208;membered diterpenoids. These products represent the first macrocyclic sesterterpenoids from plants and the largest sesterterpenoid ring system identified to date. Two variants F516A and F516G producing approximately 3.3&#8208; and 2.5&#8208;fold, respectively, more sesterterpenoids than the wild&#8208;type enzyme were engineered. Both 18&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered ring sesterterpenoids displayed significant inhibitory activity on the IL&#8208;2 and IFN&#8208;&#947; production of T&#8197;cells probably via inhibition of the MAPK pathway. The findings will contribute to the development of efficient biocatalysts to create bioactive macrocyclic sesterterpenoids, and also herald a new potential in the well&#8208;trodden territory of plant terpenoid biosynthesis.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rhodium(I)&#8211;Platinum(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts</title>

Catalyzed hydrogenation of NO2, NO, and N2O is achieved under mild conditions by air stable olefin RhI&#8211;PtII bimetallic complexes. In the molecular catalysts, the Rh&#8722;Pt interaction is a direct metal&#8722;metal bond and cooperativity of both metals in substrate activation is proposed based on DFT. A hyponitrite rhodium complex is a key intermediate for the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step in the catalytic reduction of NO.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides NO2, NO, and N2O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21st century. A bimetallic RhI&#8211;PtII complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxifying these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to form water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3&#8211;4&#8197;bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to water and N2 was recorded, making these RhI&#8211;PtII complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON=38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2, TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NOx were investigated by a combination of multinuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO2 proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H2O, followed by the generation of N2O and H2O, which is then further converted to N2 and H2O. The nitrogen&#8722;nitrogen bond&#8208;forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N2O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) complex, which was detected as an intermediate.

Double the stoichiometry in radical recognition: A highly selective and efficient protocol, based on radical&#8208;pairing interactions, was developed for the recognition of two viologen radical cations in solution using a size&#8208;matched radical host.







Abstract
Complexation between a viologen radical cation (V.+) and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) diradical dication (CBPQT2(.+)) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of a pair of V.+ using radical&#8208;pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (MV.+) in a size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host &#8212; namely, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalene)2(.+), i.e., CBPQN2(.+). Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cations in CBPQN2(.+) suitable for binding two MV.+ with relatively short (3.05&#8211;3.25&#8197;&#197;) radical&#8208;pairing distances. The size&#8208;matched bisradical dicationic host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association with the two MV.+ in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex &#8212; namely, [(MV)2&#8834;CBPQN]4(.+) &#8211; in MeCN was confirmed by VT 1H&#8197;NMR, as well as by EPR spectroscopy. The solid&#8208;state superstructure of [(MV)2&#8834;CBPQN]4(.+) reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05&#8197;&#197;) between the three different V.+, suggesting that localization of the radical&#8208;pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two MV.+ inside the bisradical dicationic host. Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host&#8208;guest radical&#8208;pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox&#8208;switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.

         <title>Highly Selective Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene over Atomically Isolated Nickel&#8211;Nitrogen Site/Copper Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25485-25492, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to enhance the selectivity of the CO2 electroreduction reaction towards C2H4 with a 6&#8208;fold increase in comparison with that of the non&#8208;tandem catalysts. The local high concentration of CO generated by atomically isolated nickel&#8211;nitrogen sites PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites, thus switching from CH4 to C2H4 production with a Faradaic efficiency of 57.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, an effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to improve the selectivity of the CO2RR towards C2H4 by multiple distinct catalytic sites in local vicinity. An earth&#8208;abundant elements&#8208;based tandem electrocatalyst PTF(Ni)/Cu is constructed by uniformly dispersing Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the porphyrinic triazine framework anchored with atomically isolated nickel&#8211;nitrogen sites (PTF(Ni)) for the enhanced CO2RR to produce C2H4. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 57.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is about 6 times higher than the non&#8208;tandem catalyst PTF/Cu, which produces CH4 as the major carbon product. The operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the local high concentration of CO generated by PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8722;C coupling to form C2H4 on the nearby Cu NP sites. The work offers an effective avenue to design electrocatalysts for the highly selective CO2RR to produce multicarbon products via a tandem route.

Thioflavin&#8197;T dramatically enhances the structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel and drives the self&#8208;assembly by interfering the metastable phase of the two&#8208;step nucleation process.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides is a key direction for fabrication of advanced materials. Novel approaches for fine tuning of macroscopic and microscopic properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies are of a high demand for constructing biomaterials with desired properties. In this work, while studying the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) dipeptide self&#8208;assembly using the Thioflavin&#8197;T (ThT) dye, we observed that the presence of ThT strongly modifies structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel. Notably, the presence of ThT resulted in a tenfold increase of the gelation time and in the formation of short and dense fibers in the hydrogel. As a result of these morphological alteration higher thermal stability, and most important, tenfold increase of the hydrogel rigidity was achieved. Hence, ThT not only slowed the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel formation, but also strongly enhanced its mechanical properties. In this study, we provide a detailed description of the ThT effect on the hydrogel properties and suggest the mechanisms for this phenomenon, paving the way for the novel approach to the control of the peptide hydrogels&#8217; micro&#8208; and macroscale properties.

         <title>Overcoming the Low Driving Force in Forming Depolymerizable Polymers through Monomer Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25493-25498, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of fused&#8208;ring cyclooctene monomers substantially elevates the driving force in forming depolymerizable polymers, enabling living polymerization and block copolymer synthesis at initial monomer concentration &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. The sequence of isomerization&#8208;polymerization&#8208;depolymerization forms a unique closed&#8208;loop that can be exploited for developing chemically recyclable polymers.







Abstract
While depolymerizable polymers have been intensely pursued as a potential solution to address the challenges in polymer sustainability, most depolymerization systems are characterized by a low driving force in polymerization, which poses difficulties for accessing diverse functionalities and architectures of polymers. Here, we address this challenge by using a cyclooctene&#8208;based depolymerization system, in which the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans alkene isomerization significantly increases the ring strain energy to enable living ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at monomer concentrations &#8805;0.025&#8197;M. An additional trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused at the 5,6&#8208;position of the cyclooctene reduces the ring strain energy of cyclooctene, enabling the corresponding polymers to depolymerize into the cis&#8208;cyclooctene monomers. The use of excess triphenylphosphine was found to be essential to suppress secondary metathesis and depolymerization. The high&#8208;driving&#8208;force living polymerization of the trans&#8208;cyclobutane fused trans&#8208;cyclooctene system holds promise for developing chemically recyclable polymers of a wide variety of polymer architectures.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Formation of Rh2O3 Nanoparticles on h&#8208;BN Support for Highly Controlled Methane Partial Oxidation to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25411-25418, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;phase Rh2O3 nanocatalyst is developed by exploiting the stabilization of the (110) plane of the Rh2O3(I) seed on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) after decomposition of the rhodium precursor. By using the Rh/h&#8208;BN, catalytic methane partial oxidation to syngas was accomplished solely via the direct route.







Abstract
Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8208;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8208;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to the nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8208;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed planes on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping a H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Induced Perpetual Recovery on All Elemental Defects in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25567-25574, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable solar cells, ferrocene as a perpetual recovering agent has been developed to fix all elemental defects in ABX3 perovskite by a chain&#8208;reaction cycle. The ferrocene cations can form a 1D perovskite structure which has suitable dissociation energy to convert back to light&#8208;harvesting 3D perovskite and reactivate its photovoltaic performance. Based on this recovering agent, perovskite solar cell can achieve &gt;10&#8201;000&#8197;h lifetime.







Abstract
Lead halide perovskites always emerge complex interactions among different elemental ions, which lead to multiple intrinsic imperfections. Elemental defects, such as amine, Pb, and I vacancies at A&#8208;, B&#8208;, and X&#8208;sites, are main issues to deteriorate perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, most previous passivators can only temporarily fix partial inactive vacancies as sacrificial agents. Herein, we propose a recovery agent, ferrocene (Fc), which can form a one&#8208;dimensional perovskite with adequate steric cavities and suitable dissociation energy to recover all elemental defects back to active light&#8208;harvesting perovskites, and regenerate Fc itself meanwhile. Based on this perpetual chain&#8208;reaction cycle, corresponding PSCs maintain &gt;10&#8201;000&#8208;hour lifetime in inert condition and &gt;1000&#8208;hour durabilities under various extreme environments, including continuous 85&#8201;&#176;C heating, 50&#8201;% relative humidity wetting, and 1&#8208;sun light soaking.

A supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem that reprograms the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations is reported, achieving an efficient suppression of breast cancer.







Abstract
Incorporating multiple molecular interactions within a system to realize the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is prospected to be of great potential in cancer therapy. Herein, we report a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem, which reprogrammed the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations. In the nanosystem, amphipathic telluroether was coordinated with MnII to self&#8208;assemble into micelle, on which a siNrf2 integrated DNA network was assembled. The great electron&#8208;donating capability of telluroether was revealed to greatly promote MnII&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reaction to generate subversive .OH in cancer cells. In response to adenosine triphosphoric acid, the siNrf2 was specially released in cytoplasm for down&#8208;regulating expression of detoxification enzymes, which enhanced chemocatalysis&#8208;mediated oxidative stress in cancer cells, thus significantly suppressing tumor progression.

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8211;Oxygen Bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25538-25545, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed at room temperature. This is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.







Abstract
In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8211;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiHx material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO2 methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO2 and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiHx catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiHx has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8211;oxygen bond activation than the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transfer from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO2 and CO.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen Reduction via Integrated Construction and Synergistic Catalysis of Porous Platinum Alloy and Defective Graphitic Carbon</title>

A porous platinum&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon results in improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance as a result of the interaction between the ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C units.







Abstract
Integrated fabrication through the strong interaction between catalyst and carrier is crucial to realize efficient oxygen electrocatalysis for fuel cells. We report herein a porous Pt&#8208;rich alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon via integration engineering, where a synergistic catalysis between ternary PtCuCo alloy and graphitic Co&#8208;N&#8208;C results in the optimized reaction pathway and improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The hybrid catalyst PtCuCo@Co&#8208;N&#8208;C delivers a mass activity of 1.14&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the full&#8208;cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and 780&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti&#8208;corrosion capabilities and improving the ORR performance of Pt&#8208;based catalysts.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE and a peak power density of 960&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the full-cell assessment, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.12&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 780&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Experimental results combined with theoretical simulations suggest that the mutual assistance between porous Pt alloy and Co-N-C accounts for the enhanced catalytic performance. Such integrated engineering concept is significant for strengthening the anti-corrosion capabilities and improving the ORR performance of Pt-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters</title>

Simple methylation at the 4&#8208;position of a 4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enables direct observation by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy of the previously elusive bridging dioxacarbenium ion, supporting the hypothesis that distal group participation by secondary esters is disfavored by the conformation of the ester.







Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above &#8776;&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary ester, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Dicationic Diazahexabenzocoronene Derivative on the Au(111) Surface</title>

A hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice is prepared by on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic nanographene.







Abstract
The atomically precise control over the size, shape and structure of nanographenes (NGs) or the introduction of heteroatom dopants into their sp2&#8208;carbon lattice confer them valuable electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a hexabenzocoronene derivative embedded with graphitic nitrogen in its honeycomb lattice, achieved via on&#8208;surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface. Combined scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy investigations unveil the chemical and electronic structures of the obtained dicationic NG. Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements reveal a considerable variation of the local contact potential difference toward lower values with respect to the gold surface, indicative of its positive net charge. Altogether, we introduce the concept of cationic nitrogen doping of NGs on surfaces, opening new avenues for the design of novel carbon nanostructures.

Ammonia has been converted into hydrazine, a chemical of utmost importance for organic synthesis and energy purposes. In their Communication on page&#8197;25230, Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me et&#8197;al. report that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous ammonia at a high frequency, act as microreactors to activate and convert ammonia into hydrazine at the gas&#8211;liquid interface. Maintaining the aqueous solution close to 30&#8201;&#176;C prevents the degradation of in&#8197;situ produced hydrazine.

         <title>Inside Cover: Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;Index Faceting (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2021)</title>

High&#8208;index NiO faceting during molten salt synthesis is investigated with density functional theory by Jeffrey&#8197;D. Rimer, Matteo Maestri, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;25391. Trapezohedral NiO particles observed in experiments are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to locally ordered alkali chloride structures, which act as capping agents during crystal growth. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO particles are produced because of their stable hydroxylated surfaces.

         <title>Back Cover: Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2021)</title>

         <dc:description>
Protons confined within nonionic reverse micelles experience a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which forward proton hopping, or the Grotthuss mechanism, is restricted. This effect is size&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent: Protons in small micelles or at lower concentrations diffuse freely via forward hopping. For larger sizes or higher concentrations, ions accumulate at the interfacial region of the micelle, causing a gridlock that decreases available pathways for movement of protons to the water interior, as reported by Martina Havenith, Teresa Head&#8208;Gordon, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;25419.

Selective recognition of two stacked viologen radical cations in solution using a size&#8208;matched radical host is reported by J.&#8197;Fraser Stoddart and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;25454. By employing 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene as the linker, the bisradical dicationic host is able to accommodate two methyl viologen radical cation guests with strong and cooperative binding.

         <title>Crystalline Sponge Method: X&#8208;ray Structure Analysis of Small Molecules by Post&#8208;Orientation within Porous Crystals&#8212;Principle and Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Studies</title>

Crystal growth is not needed for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis when the crystalline sponge method is used. This method makes use of single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (&#8220;crystalline sponges&#8221;) that can absorb small guest molecules within the pores and make the absorbed guests observable by conventional single&#8208;crystal diffraction. This Review focuses on the principles of this approach as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies.







Abstract
This Review discusses, along with the historical background, the principles as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies of the crystalline sponge (CS) method, a new single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) method for the analysis of the structures of small molecules without sample crystallization. The method uses single&#8208;crystalline porous coordination networks (crystalline sponges) that can absorb small guest molecules within their pores. The absorbed guest molecules are ordered in the pores through molecular recognition and become observable by conventional SCXRD analysis. The complex {[(ZnI2)3(tpt)2]&#8901;x(solvent)}n (tpt=tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine) was first proposed as a crystalline sponge and has been most generally used. Crystalline sponges developed later are also discussed here. The principle of the CS method can be described as &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; of the absorbed guest, whose ordering is templated by the pre&#8208;latticed cavities. The method has been widely applied to synthetic chemistry as well as natural product studies, for which proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples will be shown here.

         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent developments in which both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. The strategies for the preparation and functionalization of heterogeneous catalysts, reaction mechanisms, and the roles of heterogeneous catalysts in these reactions are also discussed.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocycles, such as pyrroles, pyrimidines, quinazolines, and quinoxalines, are important building blocks for organic chemistry and the fine&#8208;chemical industry. For their synthesis, catalytic borrowing hydrogen and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions of alcohols as sustainable reagents have received significant attention in recent years. To overcome the problems of product separation and catalyst reusability, several metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to achieve these transformations with good yields and selectivity. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments using both noble and non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts to synthesize N&#8208;heterocycles from alcohols and N&#8208;nucleophiles via acceptorless dehydrogenation or borrowing hydrogen methodologies. Furthermore, this Minireview introduces strategies for the preparation and functionalization of the corresponding heterogeneous catalysts, discusses the reaction mechanisms and the roles of metal electronic states, and the influence of support Lewis acid&#8211;base properties on these reactions.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Fluorescent Polymeric Particles with Tunable White Light Emission Based on Aggregation Microenvironment Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25246-25251, November 22, 2021. </description>

Core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) were constructed based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) via the stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation (2SP) polymerization, and white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs was achieved with the CIE1931 coordinate of (0.33, 0.34), which could be simply but effectively tuned by manipulating the aggregation microenvironment of the AIEgens.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emitting polymers (WLEPs) based on aggregation microenvironment&#8208;sensitive aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have aroused great interest in lighting and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we developed a novel strategy to construct WLEP particles via a stepwise self&#8208;stabilized precipitation polymerization of two emission&#8208;complementary AIEgens under core&#8211;shell engineering, where the AIE characteristics and FRET process of core&#8211;shell fluorescent polymeric particles (CS&#8208;FPPs) could be modulated by altering aggregation microenvironment under swelling and shrinking of polymers, facilitating the tunable white light emission of CS&#8208;FPPs. Furthermore, such tuning could be fast realized in the solid state, thus demonstrating the potential in anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work proved the significance of aggregation microenvironment on emission of luminogens, guiding the development of high&#8208;efficiency emission&#8208;tunable materials.

Ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation of mono, di and trisubstituted cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;aroyloxy ketones is reported. Key step is the radical/radical cross&#8208; coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle and a ketyl radical formed in the NHC catalysis cycle.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.

Herein, a photocatalyzed, intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;benzoyloxyamides has been developed to afford &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Upon the formation of amidyl radical via reductive N&#8722;O bond cleavage, selective radical ipso&#8208;addition followed by a redox&#8208;neutral radical&#8211;polar crossover was suggested to be responsible for the preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.







Abstract
We report an approach for the intramolecular C(sp2)&#8722;H amidation of N&#8208;acyloxyamides under photoredox conditions to produce &#948;&#8208;benzolactams with an aryl&#8208;alkyl &#963;&#8208;bond relocation. Computational studies on the designed reductive single electron transfer strategy led us to identify N&#8208;[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl] group as the most effective amidyl radical precursor. Upon the formation of an azaspirocyclic radical intermediate by the selective ipso&#8208;addition with outcompeting an ortho&#8208;attack, radical&#8211;polar crossover was then rationalized to lead to the rearomative ring&#8208;expansion with preferential C&#8722;C bond migration.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Propargyl Esters and Alkynylsilanes: Synthesis of Vinylallene Derivatives through a Twofold 1,2&#8208;Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of structurally complex allenylsilanes through gold&#8208;catalyzed coupling of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes is described. DFT calculations support a stepwise pathway consisting of two 1,2&#8208;rearrangements (acyloxy and silyl). A preliminary study on the enantioselective version would demonstrate its feasibility (er up to 95:5).







Abstract
The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy/[1,2]&#8208;silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom&#8208;economy, broad substrate scope, easy scale&#8208;up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]&#8208;acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II&#8208;dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of propargyl esters with alkynylsilanes under gold catalysis provides vinylallene derivatives through consecutive [1,2]-acyloxy/[1,2]-silyl rearrangements. Good yields, full atom-economy, broad substrate scope, easy scale-up and low catalyst loadings are salient features of this novel transformation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest a reaction mechanism involving initial [1,2]-acyloxy rearrangement to generate a gold vinylcarbene intermediate which upon regioselective attack of the alkynylsilane affords a vinyl cation which undergoes a type II-dyotropic rearrangement involving the silyl group and the metal fragment. Preliminary results on the enantioselective version of this transformation are also disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,6&#8208;Anthrazoline&#8208;Linked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles and Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Friedl&#228;nder Synthesis</title>

An old chemistry, but a new efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and 2D polymer! We demonstrated that Friedl&#228;nder synthesis which involves both dynamic imine condensation and aldol condensation is highly effective for the synthesis of kinetically stable, 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline&#8208;based all sp2 C/N containing macrocycles and crystalline 2D polymer.







Abstract
Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodology. Herein, we report the preparation of a 1,6&#8208;anthrazoline (AZ)&#8208;linked crystalline 2D polymer AZP via acid mediated Friedl&#228;nder synthesis. The feasibility was examined first by two model reactions, followed by synthesis of three AZ&#8208;based macrocycles MCn (n=5&#8211;7), in which hexagonal MC6 was isolated as the major product. The favorable macrocycle formation could be largely attributed to the dynamic feature of Friedl&#228;nder synthesis, which involves both imine condensation and aldol condensation. The structure and crystallinity of AZP were confirmed by experiments and simulation. The skeletons of the macrocycles and polymer consist of all&#8208;sp2 hybridized C/N atoms and are thus &#960;&#8208;conjugated and electro&#8208;active. Our studies provide a rational way to access kinetically stable 2D crystalline polymers by combination of different dynamic covalent chemistries.

The dianion [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO affording C&#8722;C bond formation and Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment migration. Subsequent reaction with N2O cleaves a P&#8722;C bond generating an anionic ketene&#8208;derivative which cyclotrimerizes to give the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative, [Ph2P(S)COLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. The experimental observations are rationalized by a detailed theoretical study of the reaction mechanism by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT methods.







Abstract
Synthesis of value&#8208;added products from simple C1 feedstocks is an attractive alternative avenue to traditional fossil fuels. Hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives are highly useful molecules but are often challenging to prepare. Herein, we report that the lithium complex [(Ph2P(S))2CLi2(THF)]2 1 reacts with CO lead to C&#8722;C bond formation and migration of a Ph2P(S)&#8208;fragment affording 2. Subsequent reaction with N2O results in oxidative cleavage of a P&#8722;C bond affording [Ph2P(S)OLi(THF)2]2 4 and the anionic ketene&#8208;derivative Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2 5. Heating 5 prompts cyclotrimerization giving the hexa&#8208;substituted benzene derivative [Ph2P(S)CCOLi(THF)2]3 6 regioselectively. This transition metal&#8208;free protocol to a hexa&#8208;substituted benzene is viable on a gram scale and permits the incorporation of 13C labels. The mechanisms of these reactions are detailed via extensive DFT computations.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Sacrificial Bond Transformation in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Molecular Oxygen Reduction</title>

Bond breaking/re&#8208;formation to tune local coordination: Deliberate construction and subsequent selective cleavage of sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds render flexible tunability to control the local coordination of metal single atoms. The oxidized sulfur functionalization around the Fe center helps the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C reach the ORR volcano&#8208;plot apex by optimizing the adsorption strength of the oxygenated intermediates.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen sites show great prospect for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), whereas the unsatisfactory adsorption&#8208;desorption behaviors of oxygenated intermediates on the metal centers impede improvement of the ORR performance. We propose a new conceptual strategy of introducing sacrificial bonds to remold the local coordination of Fe&#8722;Nx sites, via controlling the dynamic transformation of the Fe&#8722;S bonds in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst. Spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the selective cleavage of the sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds induces the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxidized sulfur on the Fe centers. The newly functionalized moieties endow the catalyst with superior ORR activity and remarkable stability, owing to the reduced electron localization around the Fe centers facilitating the desorption of ORR intermediates. These findings provide a unique perspective for precisely controlling the coordination structure of single&#8208;atom materials to optimize their activity.

MoS2/GF behaves as a superb and durable electrocatalyst for ambient NH3 generation via NO reduction in acids. It is capable of attaining a Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The MoS2&#8208;based Zn&#8208;NO battery delivers a power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH3 production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS2 nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS2/GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS2/GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH3 yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Using MoS2 nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8208;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1. Calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an acceptance&#8211;donation mechanism and disfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8722;N bond.

Herein, we report that MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 76.6&#8201;% and a large NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of up to 99.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Using MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet-loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof-of-concept device of Zn-NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 411.8&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo-edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an acceptance&#8211;donation mechanism and disfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8722;N bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Benzothiophene Synthesis via Enantiospecific Coupling of Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25313-25317, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C2 alkylation of functionalized benzothiophenes has been explored. Enantiospecific C&#8722;C bond formation is achieved via O&#8208;activation and 1,2&#8208;metalate shift of benzothiophene S&#8208;oxide boronate complexes, which enables expedient access to chiral C2&#8208;alkylated benzothiophenes.







Abstract
Benzothiophenes are valuable heterocycles that are widely used in medicines, agrochemicals, and materials science. Herein, we report a general method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzothiophenes via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C2&#8208;alkylation of benzothiophenes with boronic esters. The reactions utilize benzothiophene S&#8208;oxides in lithiation&#8208;borylations to generate intermediate arylboronate complexes, and subsequent Tf2O&#8208;promoted S&#8722;O bond cleavage to trigger a Pummerer&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;metalate shift, which gives the coupled products with complete enantiospecificity. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl boronic esters and aryl boronic esters are successfully coupled with a range of C3&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes. Importantly, this transformation does not require the use of C3 directing groups, therefore it overcomes a major limitation of previously developed transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C2 alkylations of benzothiophenes.

         <title>Unexpected Formation of Metallofulleroids from Multicomponent Reactions, with Crystallographic and Computational Studies of the Cluster Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25269-25273, November 22, 2021. </description>

Various metallofulleroids were generated from a new isocyanide&#8208;induced multicomponent reaction on clusterfullerenes. One ketenimine metallofulleroid has fixed Lu3N cluster due to the presence of the nearby organic appendant from a neighbor molecule in the solid state.







Abstract
New multicomponent reactions involving an isocyanide, terminal or internal alkynes, and endohedral metallofullerene (EMF) Lu3N@C80 yield metallofulleroids which are characterized by mass&#8208;spectrometry, HPLC, and multiple 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Single crystal studies revealed one ketenimine metallofulleroid has ordered Lu3N cluster which is unusual for EMF monoadducts. Computational analysis, based on crystallographic data, confirm that the endohedral cluster motion is controlled by the position of the exohedral organic appendants. Our findings provide a new functionalization reaction for EMFs, and a potential facile approach to freeze the endohedral cluster motion at relatively high temperatures.

Ti3C2 MXene&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids were fabricated through molten salt etching for illustrating their interactions. The pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu were demonstrated. A symmetric supercapacitor based on Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode delivered a high energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1.0&#8197;M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, areal capacitance of 290.5&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at power density of 0.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25307-25312, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl sulfonyl fluorides, typically inert to transition metal catalysis, undergo a Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfonative Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. The reaction can occur without added base and turns the &#8722;SO2F group into a divergent handle for C&#8722;C or S&#8722;Nu coupling.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have emerged as powerful &#8220;click&#8221; electrophiles to access sulfonylated derivatives. Yet, they are relatively inert towards C&#8722;C bond forming transformations, notably under transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Here, we describe conditions under which aryl sulfonyl fluorides act as electrophiles for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling. This desulfonative cross&#8208;coupling occurs selectively in the absence of base and, unusually, even in the presence of strong acids. Divergent one&#8208;step syntheses of two analogues of bioactive compounds showcase the expanded reactivity of sulfonyl fluorides to encompass both S&#8722;Nu and C&#8722;C bond formation. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest oxidative addition occurs at the C&#8722;S bond followed by desulfonation to form a Pd&#8208;F intermediate that facilitates transmetalation.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed s&#8208;Block Magnesium Sites for Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>

Atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitized C3N4 (Mg&#8208;C3N4) show weak CO adsorption because of nondirectionally delocalized Mg 3&#8197;s orbit. Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of &#8776;18&#8201;000&#8197;hour&#8722;1 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%. Furthermore, the flow cell fabricated with Mg&#8208;C3N4 reaches a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under a CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal sites have been extensively studied for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO due to their robust CO2 activation ability. However, the strong hybridization between directionally localized d orbits and CO vastly limits CO desorption and thus the activities of atomically dispersed transition metal sites. In contrast, s&#8208;block metal sites possess nondirectionally delocalized 3s orbits and hence weak CO adsorption ability, providing a promising way to solve the suffered CO desorption issue. Herein, we constructed atomically dispersed magnesium atoms embedded in graphitic carbon nitride (Mg&#8208;C3N4) through a facile heat treatment for CO2RR. Theoretical calculations show that the CO desorption on Mg sites is easier than that on Fe and Co sites. This theoretical prediction is demonstrated by experimental CO temperature program desorption and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. As a result, Mg&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a high turnover frequency of &#8776;18&#8201;000 per hour in H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8722;300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell, under a high CO Faradaic efficiency &#8805;90&#8201;% in KHCO3 electrolyte. This work sheds a new light on s&#8208;block metal sites for efficient CO2RR to CO.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Cyapho&#8208;Cyanamide Salt</title>

We describe the step&#8208;wise synthesis of the novel cyapho&#8208;cyanamide ion, [N(CN)(CP)]&#8722;, obtained by the reaction of sodium phosphanide, Na(PH2), with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). Preliminary reactions of the ion with electrophiles reveal the cyclisation reactions are available on functionalisation.







Abstract
We describe a facile synthesis of the cyapho&#8208;cyanamide salt [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] from reaction of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][PH2] (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6=1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane) with dimethyl N&#8208;cyanocarbonimidate, (MeO)2C=N(CN). The reaction proceeds with elimination of two equivalents of methanol. Careful tuning of the reaction conditions allowed for the isolation and characterization of the N&#8208;cyano(carboximidate)phosphide intermediate [HP{C(OMe)N(CN)}]&#8722;. Due to the adverse effects of methanol in these reaction mixtures, a bulk scale synthesis of [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][N(CN)(CP)] could be achieved by addition of a base (LiHMDS) to neutralize the resulting alcohol. Further reactivity studies of this anion reveal that functionalization at the phosphorus atom is viable to yield a new family of cyanide&#8208;functionalised phosphorus heterocycles.

         <title>An Effective Strategy for Designing Nonlinear Optical Crystals by Combining the Structure&#8208;Directing Property of Oxyfluorides with Chemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25302-25306, November 22, 2021. </description>

A non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) was synthesized by combining the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluorides with chemical substitution. Measurement of the optical properties shows that the compound satisfies all key property requirements to be promising application from UV to mid&#8208;infrared regions as SHG materials.







Abstract
Rationally designing a high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal remains a great ongoing challenge. It involves not only the design of noncentrosymmetric structures but also property optimization. In this communication, a new strategy for effectively designing the NLO crystal has been put forward, that is, using the structure&#8208;directing property of oxyfluoride anions to obtain a noncentrosymmetric and polar structure, and then by substitution of IO3&#8722; for isovalent F&#8722; anions to further enhance the SHG response. With this strategy, a new iodate fluoride, Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) has been successfully designed from the Ba2(MoO3F2)F2 with the cis&#8208;directing [MoO4F2]4&#8722; groups. It exhibits a large SHG response (&#8776;8&#215;KDP), a wide transparent region (0.30&#8211;10.92&#8197;&#956;m), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT) (88.53&#8197;MW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and a large birefringence (&#8776;0.264@532&#8197;nm). These indicate Ba2[MoO3F(IO3)](MoO3F2) would be a promising NLO crystal.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Collective Spin Excitations of a Triangulene&#8208;Based Nanostar</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25224-25229, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A star&#8208;shaped triangulene cyclic hexamer, which accumulates 12 unpaired electrons, was prepared by combining solution chemistry and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The resulting triangulene&#8208;based nanostar was visualized by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy on a gold substrate. The collective spin excitations, explained by the Heisenberg model, were revealed by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy.







Abstract
Triangulene nanographenes are open&#8208;shell molecules with predicted high spin state due to the frustration of their conjugated network. Their long&#8208;sought synthesis became recently possible over a metal surface. Here, we present a macrocycle formed by six [3]triangulenes, which was obtained by combining the solution synthesis of a dimethylphenyl&#8208;anthracene cyclic hexamer and the on&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of this precursor over a gold substrate. The resulting triangulene nanostar exhibits a collective spin state generated by the interaction of its 12 unpaired &#960;&#8208;electrons along the conjugated lattice, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering of six S=1 sites (one per triangulene unit). Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy resolved three spin excitations connecting the singlet ground state with triplet states. The nanostar behaves close to predictions from the Heisenberg model of an S=1 spin ring, representing a unique system to test collective spin modes in cyclic systems.

         <title>Probing Water State during Lipidic Mesophases Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25274-25280, November 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the phase transitions from cubic to reverse hexagonal phase in lipidic mesophase at molecular level. The dynamics of both water and lipids, as well as the hydrogen bond network of confined water were monitored during the phase transition. The results demonstrate clear dynamical difference between bound and interstitial water in both phases.







Abstract
We investigate the static and dynamic states of water network during the phase transitions from double gyroid (
) to double diamond (
) bicontinuous cubic phases and from the latter to the reverse hexagonal (HII) phase in monolinolein based lipidic mesophases by combining FTIR and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). In both cubic(s) and HII phase, two dynamically different fractions of water are detected and attributed to bound and interstitial free water. The dynamics of the two water fractions are all slower than bulk water due to the hydrogen&#8208;bonds between water molecules and the lipid's polar headgroups and to nanoconfinement. Both FTIR and BDS results suggest that a larger fraction of water is hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the headgroup of lipids in the HII phase at higher temperature than in the cubic phase at lower temperature via H&#8208;bonds, which is different from the common expectation that the number of H&#8208;bonds should decrease with increase of temperature. These findings are rationalized by considering the topological ratio of interface/volume of the two mesophases.

         <title>Conversion of Ammonia to Hydrazine Induced by High&#8208;Frequency Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25230-25234, November 22, 2021. </description>

Cavitation bubbles act as microreactors to activate NH3, resulting in the formation of NH species that further recombine to hydrazine at the bubble&#8211;liquid interface. One of the advantages of this technology is the compartmentation of the as&#8208;formed hydrazine in the bulk solution, maintained at only 30&#8201;&#176;C, which limits its thermal degradation.







Abstract
Hydrazine is a chemical of utmost importance in our society, either for organic synthesis or energy use. The direct conversion of NH3 to hydrazine is highly appealing, but it remains a very difficult task because the degradation of hydrazine is thermodynamically more feasible than the cleavage of the N&#8722;H bond of NH3. As a result, any catalyst capable of activating NH3 will thus unavoidably decompose N2H4. Here we show that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous NH3 at a high frequency, act as microreactors to activate and convert NH3 to NH species, without assistance of any catalyst, yielding hydrazine at the bubble&#8211;liquid interface. The compartmentation of in&#8208;situ&#8208;produced hydrazine in the bulk solution, which is maintained close to 30&#8201;&#176;C, advantageously prevents its thermal degradation, a recurrent problem faced by previous technologies. This work also points towards a path to scavenge .OH radicals by adjusting the NH3 concentration.

         <title>Phenylimino Indolinone: A Green&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive T&#8208;Type Photoswitch Exhibiting Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 48, Page 25290-25295, November 22, 2021. </description>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive T&#8208;type photoswitches with negative photochromism are rare and interesting candidates for a wide range of applications. Here, we describe the computer&#8208;assisted rational design of phenylimino indolinone (PIO) and its characterization in the ground and excited state using the full toolbox of physical organic chemistry.







Abstract
Imines are photoaddressable motifs useful in the development of new generations of molecular switches, but their operation with low&#8208;energy photons and control over isomer stability remain challenging. Based on a computational design, we developed phenylimino indolinone (PIO), a green&#8208;light&#8208;addressable T&#8208;type photoswitch showing negative photochromism. The isomerization behavior of this photoactuator of the iminothioindoxyl (ITI) class was studied using time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies on time scales from femtoseconds to the steady state and by quantum&#8208;chemical analyses. The understanding of the isomerization properties and substituent effects governing these photoswitches opens new avenues for the development of novel T&#8208;type visible&#8208;light&#8208;addressable photoactuators based on C=N bonds.

         <dc:description>The indoor air quality is of prime importance for human daily life and health, for which the adsorbents like zeolites and silica&#8208;gels are widely used for air dehumidification and harmful gases capture. Herein, we develop a pore&#8208;nanospace post&#8208;engineering strategy to optimize the hydrophilicity, water&#8208;uptake capacity and air&#8208;purifying ability of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with long&#8208;term stability, offering an ideal candidate with autonomous multi&#8208;functionality of moisture control and pollutants sequestration. Through variant tuning of organic&#8208;linkers carrying hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the pore&#8208;nanospaces of prototypical UiO&#8208;67, a moderately hydrophilic MOF (UiO&#8208;67&#8208;4Me&#8208;NH  2  &#8208;38%) with high thermal, hydrolytic and acid&#8208;base stability is screened out, featuring S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherms exactly located in the recommended comfortable and healthy ranges of relative humidity for indoor ventilation (45%&#8722;65% RH) and adverse health effects minimization (40&#8208;60% RH).

         <title>Creating Dynamic Nanospaces in Solution by Cationic Cages as Multirole Catalytic Platform for Unconventional C(sp)&#8208;H Activation&#160;Beyond Enzyme Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular catalysis of artificial synthetic&#8208;hosts is originally bio&#8208;inspired for reactivities intrinsic to enzymes, but more exceptional properties and functions may be expected beyond enzyme mimics. Herein we demonstrate that, based on the creation of dynamic nanospaces in solution by highly charged positive coordination cage of [Pd  6  (RuL  3  )  8  ]  28+  , multirole and multi&#8208;way cageconfined catalysis is accomplishable for versatile functions and anomalous reactivities with the aid of biomimetic cage effect. The high cationic&#8208;host charges drive partial deprotonation of 24 imidazole&#8208;NHs on cage sphere alike imidazole&#8208;residuals in proteins, generating amphoteric heterogeneity in solution to enforce effective cavitybasicity against solution&#8208;acidity. Synergistic actions arisen from cage hydrophobicity, host&#8208;guest electrostatic interactions and imidazole&#8208;N coordination facilitate C(sp)&#8208;H activation and carbanionic intermediate stabilization of terminal alkynes to achieve unusual H/D&#8208;exchange and Glaser coupling under acidic conditions, and enable phase transfers of water&#8208;insoluble substrates/products/co&#8208;catalysts to make immiscible&#8208;phase and bi&#8208;phase catalysis feasible, thus providing a useful catalytic protocol to combine merits from homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic and phase transfer catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;C Coupling Is Unlikely to Be the Rate&#8208;Determining Step in the Formation of C2+ Products in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Reduction of CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identity of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR) on Cu catalysts remains unresolved because: 1) the presence of mass transport limitation of CO; and 2) the absence of quantitative correlation between CO partial pressure (  p  CO  ) and surface CO coverage. In this work, we determined CO adsorption isotherms on Cu in a broad pH range of 7.2&#8208;13.9. Together with electrokinetic data, we demonstrate that the reaction orders of adsorbed CO at  p  CO  &lt; 0.4 and &gt; 0.6 atm are 1  st  and 0  th  , respectively, on three Cu catalysts. These results indicate that&#160;the C&#8208;C coupling is unlikely to be the RDS in the formation of C2+ products in the CORR. We propose that the hydrogenation of CO with adsorbed water is the RDS, and the site competition between CO and water leads to the observed transition of the CO reaction order.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Silica Nano&#8208;Organelles for Regulation of Cascade Reactions in Multi&#8208;Compartmentalized Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In eukaryotic cells, enzymes are compartmentalized into specific organelles so that different reactions and processes can be performed efficiently and with a high degree of control. In this work, we show that these features can be artificially emulated in robust synthetic organelles constructed using an enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization strategy. We describe an in&#8208;situ encapsulation approach that allows enzymes to be loaded into silica nanoreactors in well&#8208;defined compositions. The nanoreactors can be combined into integrated systems to produce a desired reaction outcome. We used the selective enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization and nanoreactor integration to regulate competitive cascade reactions and to modulate the kinetics of sequential reactions involving multiple nanoreactors. Furthermore, we show that the nanoreactors can be efficiently loaded into giant polymer vesicles, resulting in multi&#8208;compartmentalized microreactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Friedel&#8208;Crafts Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of spiro N&#8208;heterocycles as scaffolds that display structural novelty, three&#8208;dimensionality, beneficial physicochemical properties, and enable the controlled spatial disposition of substituents has led to a surge of interest in utilizing these compounds in drug discovery programs. Herein, we report the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven Friedel&#8208;Crafts spirocyclization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;tethered (hetero)aryls for the synthesis of a unique library of azetidine spiro&#8208;tetralins. The reaction was discovered to proceed through an unexpected interrupted Friedel&#8208;Crafts mechanism, generating a highly complex azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold. This dearomatized intermediate, formed exclusively as a single diastereomer, can be subsequently converted to the Friedel&#8208;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation of the tertiary amine, or trapped as a Diels&#8208;Alder adduct in one&#8208;pot. The rapid assembly of molecular complexity demonstrated in these reactions highlights the potential of the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven spirocyclization strategy to be utilized in the synthesis of medicinally relevant scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate&#8208;Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatioselective Imaging of Pro&#8208;metastatic Targets in Extracellular Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Probing pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers is of significant importance to evaluate the risk of tumor metastasis, but spatially&#8208;selective imaging of such targets in extracellular microenvironment is particularly challenging. By introducing the bilinguality of PNA/peptide hybrid that can speak both peptide substrate and nucleobase&#8208;pairing languages to combine with aptamer technology, we designed a smart DNA nanodevice programmed to respond sequentially to dual pro&#8208;metastatic targets, MMP2/9 and ATP, in extracellular tumor microenvironment (TME). The DNA nanodevice is established based on the combination of an ATP&#8208;responsive aptamer sensor and a MMP2/9&#8208;hydrolyzable PNA/peptide copolymer with a cell membrane&#8208;anchoring aptamer module. Taking 4T1 xenograft as a highly aggressive tumor model, the robustness of the DNA nanodevice in spatioselective imaging of MMP2/9 and ATP in TME is demonstrated. We envision that this design will enable the simultaneous visualization of multiple pro&#8208;metastatic biomarkers, which allows to gain insights into their pathological roles in tumor metastasis.</dc:description>
