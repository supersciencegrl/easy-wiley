         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea from CO2 and Nitrate by a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes. The&#160;challenge hindering the progress is the development of advanced electrocatalysts that&#160;yield urea with both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. In this work, we designed&#160;a new two&#8208;dimensional MOF, namely PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, constructed by nickel&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) ligands and square&#8208;planar FeO4 nodes. PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O exhibits remarkable performance to yield urea at a high current density of 10.1 mA cm&#8722;2 with a high FE(urea) of 54.1% in a neutral aqueous solution, surpassing those of most reported electrocatalysts. No obvious performance degradation was observed over 20 hours of continuous operation at the current density of 10.1 mA cm&#8722;2. By expanding the electrode area to 25 cm2 and operating for 8 hours, we obtained 0.164 g of high&#8208;purity urea, underscoring its potential for industrial applications. Mechanism study unveiled the enhanced performance might be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between NiPc and FeO4 sites. Specifically, NH3 produced at the FeO4 site can efficiently migrate and couple with the *NHCOOH intermediate adsorbed on the urea&#8208;producing site (NiPc). This synergistic effect results in a lower energy barrier for C&#8722;N bond formation than those of the reported catalysts with single active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Quaternization with Redox&#8208;Active Esters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quaternary carbons are embedded in various natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials; however, constructing this valuable motif is far from trivial. Conventional approaches mainly rely on classical polar disconnections and encounter bottlenecks concerning harsh conditions, functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, and step economy. In this context, Kawamata, Baran, Shenvi, and coworkers recently demonstrated that two feedstock chemicals, alkyl carboxylic acids and olefins, could be utilized to construct tetrasubstituted carbons in the presence of an inexpensive iron porphyrin catalyst and a suitable reductant combination through quaternization of radical intermediates. The method enabled access to various sterically encumbered quaternary carbons under mild and robust conditions. Taking a complete detour from conventional approaches, the present heteroselective radical&#8208;radical coupling simplifies the synthesis of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules through an innovative and distinctive disconnection approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Bader Charge Transfer in Single p&#8208;Block Atoms Doped Pd Metallene for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallene is considered as an emerging family of electrocatalysts due to its atomically layered structure and unique surface stress. Here we propose a strategy to modulate the Bader charge transfer (BCT) between Pd surface and oxygenated intermediates via p&#8208;d electronic interaction by introducing single&#8208;atomp&#8208;block metal (M = In, Sn, Pb, Bi) into Pd metallene nanosheets towards efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy suggests that doping p&#8208;block metals could facilitate electron transfer to Pd sites and thus downshift the d&#8208;band center of Pd and weaken the adsorption energy of O intermediates. Among them, the developed Bi&#8208;Pd metallene shows extraordinarily high ORR mass activity of 11.34 A mgPd&#8208;1 and 0.86 A mgPd&#8208;1 at 0.9 V and 0.95 V in alkaline solution, respectively, representing the best Pd&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts ever reported. In the cathode of a Zinc&#8208;air battery, Bi&#8208;Pd metallene could achieve an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.546 V and keep stable for 760 h at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Theoretical calculations suggest that the BCT between Pd surface and *OO intermediates greatly affects the bond length between them (dPd&#8208;*OO) and Bi doping could appropriately reduce the amount of BCT and stretch the dPd&#8208;*OO, thus enhancing the ORR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithiation induced hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi as stable anode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three dimensional (3D) framework structure is one of the most effective ways to achieve uniform zinc deposition and thus inhibit the Zn dendrites growth in working Zn metallic anode. A major challenge facing for the most commonly used 3D zincophilic hosts is that the zincophilic layer tends to peel off during repeatedly cycling, making it less stable. Herein, for the first time, a hetero&#8208;superlattice Zn/ZnLi (HS&#8208;Zn/ZnLi) anode containing periodic arrangements of metallic Zn phase and zincophilic ZnLi phase at the nanoscale, is well designed and fabricated via electrochemical lithiation method. Based on binding energy and stripping energy calculation, and the operando optical observation of plating/stripping behaviors, the zincophilic ZnLi sites with a strong Zn adsorption ability in the interior of the 3D ZnLi framework structure can effectively guide uniform Zn nucleation and dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, which significantly improves the cycling stability of the HS&#8208;Zn/ZnLi alloy (over 2800 h without a short&#8208;circuit at 2 mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, this strategy can be extended to HS&#8208;Zn/ZnNa and HS&#8208;Zn/ZnK anodes that are similar to the HS&#8208;Zn/ZnLi microstructure, also displaying significantly enhanced cycling performances in AZIBs. This study can provide a novel strategy to develop the dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with stable cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Specific Interactions Engender Dynamic and Tailorable Properties in Biomimetic Cationic Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomaterials such as spider silk and mussel byssi are fabricated by the dynamic manipulation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular biopolymer interactions. Organisms modulate solution parameters, such as pH and ion co&#8208;solute concentration, to effect these processes. These biofabrication schemes provide a conceptual framework to develop new dynamic and responsive abiotic soft material systems. Towards these ends, the chemical diversity of readily available ionic compounds offers a broad palette to manipulate the physicochemical properties of polyelectrolytes via ion&#8208;specific interactions. In this study, we show for the first time that the ion&#8208;specific interactions of biomimetic polyelectrolytes engenders a variety of phase separation behaviors, creating dynamic, thermal and ion responsive soft matter. that exhibits a spectrum of physical properties, spanning viscous fluids, to viscoelastic and viscoplastic solids. These ion dependent characteristics are further rendered general by the merger of lysine and phenylalanine into a single, amphiphilic vinyl monomer. The unprecedented breadth, precision, and dynamicity in the reported ion dependent phase behaviors thus introduce a broad array of opportunities for the future development of responsive soft matter, properties that are poised to drive developments in critical areas such as chemical sensing, soft robotics, and additive manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Reaction Modulated Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Toward Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are crucial avenues for achieving full&#8208;color displays and lighting based on perovskite materials. However, the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) has hindered their progression towards commercial applications. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites stand out as promising candidates for blue PeLEDs, with optimized control over low&#8208;dimensional phases contributing to enhanced radiative properties of excitons. Herein, the impact of organic molecular dopants on the crystallization of various n&#8208;phase structures in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. The results reveal that the highly reactive bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (BTF&#8208;PPO) molecule could effectively restrain the formation of organic spacer cation&#8208;ordered layered perovskite phases through chemical reactions, simultaneously passivate those uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the prepared PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 16.6% (@ 490 nm). The finding provides a new route to design dopant molecules for phase modulation in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation of Ammonia Catalyzed by a Molecular Iron Complex: Translating Chemical Catalysis to Mediated Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia is a promising candidate in the quest for sustainable, clean energy. With its capacity to serve as an energy carrier, the oxidation of ammonia opens avenues for carbon&#8208;neutral approaches to address worldwide growing energy needs. We report the catalytic chemical oxidation of ammonia by an Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal complex, trans&#8208;[LFeII(MeCN)2][PF6]2, where L is a macrocyclic ligand bearing four N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors. Using triarylaminium radical cations in MeCN, up to 182 turnovers of N2 per Fe were obtained from chemical catalysis with an extremely low loading of the Fe catalyst (0.043 mM, 0.004 mol % catalyst). This chemical catalysis was successfully transitioned to mediated electrocatalysis for the oxidation of ammonia. Molecular electrocatalysis by the Fe catalyst and the mediator (p&#8208;MeOC6H4)3N exhibited a catalytic half&#8208;wave potential (Ecat/2) of 0.18 V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 in MeCN, and achieved 9.3 turnovers of N2 at an applied potential of 0.20 V vs [Cp2Fe]+/0 at &#8722;20 &#176;C in controlled&#8208;potential electrolysis, with a Faradaic efficiency of 75%. Based on computational results, the catalyst undergoes sequential oxidation and deprotonation steps to form [LFeIV(NH2)2]2+, and thereafter bimetallic coupling to form an N&#8722;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application for Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800 nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834 nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Chiral 9,10&#8208;Dihydrophenanthrenes via Ligand&#8208;enabled Enantioselective Cascade &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Diarylation of Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a versatile platform for constructing point, axial, and planar chirality. Herein, we present an unexpected discovery of a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cascade &#946;,&#947;&#8208;methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H diarylation of free carboxylic acids using bidentate chiral mono&#8208;protected amino thioether&#160;ligands (MPAThio), enabling one&#8208;step synthesis of a complex chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrenes scaffolds with high enantioselectivity. In this process, two methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and three C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds were activated, leading to the formation of four C&#8722;C bonds and two chiral centers in one pot. A plausible catalytic pathway starts with enantioselective &#946;,&#947;&#8208;dehydrogenation to form chiral &#946;,&#947;&#8208;cyclohexene. Intriguingly, this olefin serves as a norbornene&#8208;type reagent (presumably assisted by the carboxyl directing effect), relaying two successive Catellani arylation reactions and a C&#8722;H alkylation reaction to furnish chiral 9,10&#8208;dihydrophenanthrenes along with meta&#8208;selective homocoupling products of iodoarene.</dc:description>

         <title>Half&#8208;curcumin&#8208;based chemiluminescence probes and their applications in detecting quasi&#8208;stable oxidized protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous methods have been reported for detecting ROS/RNS in vitro and in vivo; however, detecting methods for the secondary products of the ROS/RNS reactions, particularly quasi&#8208;stable oxidized products, have been much less explored. In this report, we observed that half&#8208;curcumins could generate chemiluminescence. In contrast to other chemiluminescence scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of a half&#8208;curcumin is the formation of a carbanion intermediate of its acetylacetone moiety, opening unique avenues for applications. In this study, we designed a series of half&#8208;curcumins CRANAD&#8208;Xs and found that CRANAD&#8208;164 could be used to detect quasi&#8208;stable oxidized proteins (QSOP) in vivo and in patient serum samples. We illustrated that CRANAD&#8208;164 could be used to monitor the responses of taurine, an amino acid with newly reported anti&#8208;aging capacity, in an inflammatory mouse model. Remarkably, we further demonstrated that the QSOP levels were much higher in the disease serum samples, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, compared to the samples from healthy controls. Moreover, our results revealed that the sera chemiluminescence intensities were higher in aged healthy controls compared to young healthy subjects, suggesting that CRANAD&#8208;164 can be used to monitor the increase of QSOP during aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics.  In&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that   the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier.As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86% after 200 cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissociative Electron Attachment Dynamics of a Promising Cancer Drug Indicates Its Radiosensitizing Potential</title>

The interaction of the compound with secondary low&#8208;energy electrons formed in large amounts during the physico&#8208;chemical phase of the irradiation may lead to these synergistic effects. The present study focuses on the first step of RRx&#8208;001 interaction with low&#8208;energy electrons in which a transient anion is formed and fragmented. Combination of two experiments allows us to disentangle the decay of the RRx&#8208;001 anion on different timescales. Sole presence of the electron initiates rapid dissociation of NO2 and HNO2 neutrals while NO2&#8211; and Br&#8211; anions are produced both directly and via intermediate complexes. Based on our quantum chemical calculations, we propose that bidirectional intersystem crossing between &#960;*(NO2) and &#963;*(C&#8211;Br) states explains the experimental spectra. The fast dynamics monitored will impact the condensed phase chemistry of the anion as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Charge&#8208;Neutral Anion Receptors for Reversible Binding and Release of Highly Hydrated Phosphate in Water</title>

A biomimetic charge&#8208;neutral anion receptor for reversible binding and release of highly hydrated phosphate in water







Abstract
Control of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8722;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1&#8211;L4), which were equipped with morpholine and polyethylene glycol terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8722; anion in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100&#8201;% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100&#8201;% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.

         <title>Constructing An Oxyhalide Interface for 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;Tolerant High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high voltage stable uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is synthesized via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Compared with conventional coating, this oxyhalide coating exhibits high ionic conductivity and excellent high voltage stability. Therefore, the interfacial side reactions between NCM811 and sulfide solid electrolytes can be effectively suppressed even at high voltage, thus the interfacial products can be well abridged. Hence, ASSBs with this oxyhalide coating delivers remarkable improvement in kinetic performance and cycling stability, the constructed ASSBs with all sulfide solid electrolyte exhibited an excellent cycling retention of 94&#8201;% over 500&#8201;cycles under 4.5&#8197;V, and 80.4&#8201;% over 200&#8201;cycles under 4.8&#8197;V. Besides, due to improved kinetic dynamic, excellent rate performance (166.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is achieved even at 0&#8201;&#176;C.Our finding proposes a simple but effective paradigm of oxyhalide coating with high voltage stability as well as high ionic conductivity to further enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high&#8208;voltage conditions. However, the interface compatibility issues remain to be solved at the interface between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte. To circumvent this issue, we propose a simple but effective approach to magic the adverse surface alkali into a uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Due to the enhancement of the close contact at interface, the ASSBs exhibit improved kinetic performance across a broad temperature range, especially at the freezing point. Besides, owing to the high&#8208;voltage tolerance of the protective layer, ASSBs demonstrate excellent cyclic stability under high cutoff voltages (500&#8197;cycles~94.0&#8201;% at 4.5&#8197;V, 200&#8197;cycles~80.4&#8201;% at 4.8&#8197;V). This work provides insights into using a high voltage stable oxyhalide coating strategy to enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.

         <title>Precise Helium Sieving from Hydrogen Using Fluorine&#8208;Decorated Carbon Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fiber membranes enables the tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities.







Abstract
Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H2), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large&#8208;scale, energy&#8208;efficient He/H2 separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers.

&lt;p&gt;The fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fiber membranes enables the tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusivity and solubility selectivities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large-scale, energy-efficient He/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers. We demonstrate that the fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fibers enables tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The fluorinated HFM-550-F-1&#8197;min membrane exhibits exceptional mixed-gas separation performance, with a binary mixed-gas He/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 10.5 and a ternary mixed-gas He/(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) selectivity of 20.8, at 40&#8197;bar feed pressure and 35&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing all previously reported polymer-based gas separation membranes, and remarkable plasticization resistance and long-term continuous stability over 30&#8197;days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Radical 1,2&#8208;Azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids is reported. This process is notable for using chiral copper&#8208;based complex as a bifunctional catalyst for photoinduced azidyl radical generation and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling, providing access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved multicomponent difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has recently emerged as a promising strategy for rapid synthesis of valuable allylic compounds in one&#8208;pot operation. However, the expansion of radical scope and enantiocontrol remain two major challenges. Herein, we describe an unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids. This mild protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, providing practical access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters. Mechanistic studies imply that the chiral copper complex is implicated as a bifunctional catalyst in both the photoredox catalyzed azidyl radical generation and enantioselective radical C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Phosphonoalamides Reveal the Biosynthetic Origin of Phosphonoalanine Natural Products and a Convergent Pathway for Their Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptomyces phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of phosphonoalanine (PnAla) biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. The transamination of phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) to PnAla drives unfavorable C&#8722;P bond formation despite its reversibility, establishing this early branch of phosphonate biosynthesis, while the promiscuity of the dipeptide and tripeptide ligases result in a dramatic expansion of observed di&#8208; and tripeptide products.







Abstract
Phosphonate natural products, with their potent inhibitory activity, have found widespread use across multiple industries. Their success has inspired development of genome mining approaches that continue to reveal previously unknown bioactive scaffolds and biosynthetic insights. However, a greater understanding of phosphonate metabolism is required to enable prediction of compounds and their bioactivities from sequence information alone. Here, we expand our knowledge of this natural product class by reporting the complete biosynthesis of the phosphonoalamides, antimicrobial tripeptides with a conserved N&#8208;terminal l&#8208;phosphonoalanine (PnAla) residue produced by Streptomyces. The phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of PnAla biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. We elucidate the biochemistry underlying the transamination of phosphonopyruvate to PnAla, a new early branchpoint in phosphonate biosynthesis catalyzed by an aminotransferase with evolved specificity for phosphonate metabolism. Peptide formation is catalyzed by two ATP&#8208;grasp ligases, the first of which produces dipeptides, and a second which ligates dipeptides to PnAla to produce phosphonoalamides. Substrate specificity profiling revealed a dramatic expansion of dipeptide and tripeptide products, while finding PnaC to be the most promiscuous dipeptide ligase reported thus far. Our findings highlight previously unknown transformations in natural product biosynthesis, promising enzyme biocatalysts, and unveil insights into the diversity of phosphonopeptide natural products.

         <title>Size Control of Chiral Nanospheres Obtained via Nanoprecipitation of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene)s in the Absence of Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable chiral nanospheres with controlled size and density can be obtained from nanoprecipitation of helical poly(phenylacetylenes). These polymer nanoparticles are stable in water in the absence of surfactants and have the ability of encapsulating metal nanoparticles or fluorescent dyes which can be further released by light irradiation.







Abstract
Nanostructuration of dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) depends on the secondary structure adopted by the polymer and the functional group used to connect the chiral pendant to the PPA backbone. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic and flexible scaffolds (para&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&lt;165&#176;) generate by nanoprecipitation low polydisperse nanospheres with controllable size at different acetone/water mixtures, those with a quasi&#8208;static behavior and the presence of an extended, almost planar structure (ortho&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&gt;165&#176;), aggregate into a mixture of spherical and oval nanostructures whose size is not controlled. Photostability studies show that poly(phenylacetylene) particles are more stable to light irradiation than when dissolved macromolecularly. Moreover, the photostability of the particle depends on the secondary structure of the PPA and its screw sense excess. This fact, in combination with the encapsulation ability of these polymer particles, allows the creation of light stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers, whose cargo can be delivered by light irradiation.

         <title>Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations exhibited large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL=&#8722;1.54), which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.







Abstract
Large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and coordination tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements, single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the gCPL value. The emission quantum yield and photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.

The first copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene that was mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase has a pseudo T&#8208;shaped structure and features classical borylene reactivity to CO. It evidences the potential feasibility of stabilizing amphoteric borylenes by an unprecedented multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics.







Abstract
A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes. Its neutral form represents a monovalent boron compound with a strongly reactive amphoteric boron center built on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron bonds, which inspires the design and synthesis of new members of the borylene family.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Powered Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Molecular Motor with Colour&#8208;Selective Single&#8208;Step Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motors access small length scale and have potential for precision technology. But the top&#8208;down control of these motors is a challenge as they are molecular objects subject to stochastic fluctuations. Now a rationally designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor demonstrates a novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism that pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down control of small motion is possible through top&#8208;down controlled molecular motors in replacement of larger actuators like MEMS or NEMS (micro&#8208; or nano&#8208;electromechanical systems) in the current precision technology. Improving top&#8208;down control of molecular motors to every single step is desirable for this purpose, and also for synchronization of motor actions for amplified effects. Here we report a designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor powered by alternated ultraviolet and visible light for processive track&#8208;walking, with the two light colours each locking the motor in a full directional step to allow saturated driving but no overstepping. This novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step, thus providing a key technical capability to advance the molecular motor&#8208;based precision technology and also motor synchronization for amplified effects.

         <title>Design and Evolution of an Enzyme for the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroolefins by Enamine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoselective Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins was promoted by a designer artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue through enamine catalysis. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroketones were prepared by this efficient biocatalytic strategy for ketone functionalization in a study highlighting the utility of artificial enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions.







Abstract
Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% e.e., &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86&#8201;%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization, and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Reactivity and Steric Parameters from 2D to 3D Bulky Pyridines: Increasing Steric Demand at Nitrogen with Chiral Azatriptycenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sterically hindered chiral pyridines were synthesized and resolved by HPLC. Their Br&#248;nsted/Lewis basicity were evaluated, and their reactivity was studied through their combination with Pd and B(C6F5)3 to generate new types of ligands/frustrated Lewis pairs. The study involved the first parameterization of the steric hindrance for a large set of pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
Sterically hindered pyridines embedded in a three&#8208;dimensional triptycene framework have been synthesized, and their resolution by chiral HPLC enabled access to unprecedented enantiopure pyridines exceeding the known steric limits. The design principles for new axially chiral pyridine derivatives are then described. To rationalize their associations with Lewis acids and transition metals, a comprehensive determination of the steric and electronic parameters for this new class of pyridines was performed. This led to the general parameterization of the steric parameters (percent buried volume %VBur, Tolman cone angle &#952;, and He8_steric descriptor) for a large set of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional pyridine derivatives. These parameters are shown to describe quantitatively their interactions with carbon&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and were used to predict the &#916;G&#176; of association with the prototypical B(C6F5)3 Lewis acid widely used in frustrated Lewis pair catalysis. This first parameterization of pyridine sterics is a fundamental basis for the future development of predictive reactivity models and for guiding new applications of bulky and chiral pyridines in organocatalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs, and transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea over Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Electronic Metal Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy on CeO2 nanorods are designed for efficient electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2. Cu single atoms modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Alloy sites accelerate the formation of C&#8722;N bond through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO. Electronic metal support interaction further modulates the interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first enantioselective method for the cyclopropanation of difluorinated olefins is presented. Using engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts in combination with diazoacetonitrile as the carbene precursor, the present method enables the production of different fluorinated cyclopropanes with high yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigid nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8722;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono&#8208;fluorinated and gem&#8208;difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8201;e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods. The synthetic utility of the present approach is further exemplified through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a key gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropane intermediate useful for the preparation of fluorinated bioactive molecules.

         <title>Photoinduced Low&#8208;Valent Zirconium Catalysis for Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced zirconocene catalysis was utilized to achieve the reductive coupling of ethers with remarkable activity and cross&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic investigation revealed that photoexcitation of low&#8208;valent zirconocene facilitates the scission of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds, resulting in benzylic radicals that recombine with Zr center. Subsequent carbomagnesiation generates benzylic Grignard reagents for downstream coupling with aliphatic ethers.







Abstract
Accessing versatile C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond through the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two distinct etheric C&#8722;O bonds is crucial in organic synthesis but remains barely explored. Herein, we report an innovative photoinduced low&#8208;valent zirconocene catalysis enabling the reductive coupling of ethers with high activity and cross&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic investigation suggests that photoexcitation of low&#8208;valent zirconocene facilitates the C(sp3)&#8722;O bond scission of benzylic ethers, leading to the benzylic radicals intermediate via a single&#8208;electron reduction pathway. The subsequent recombination of this benzylic radical with the Zr center followed by carbomagnesiation generates benzylic Grignard reagents for downstream coupling with aliphatic ethers through an SN2&#8208;like mechanism. In application, a wide range of ethers readily in situ derived from aldehydes and ketones becomes feasible with high functional group compatibility as well as excellent cross&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Unlocking Single Particle Anisotropy in Real&#8208;Time for Photoelectrochemistry Processes at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time tracking and investigation of single particle anisotropy in the dynamic photochemistry processes at the nanoscale via collision electrochemistry is performed. This high&#8208;throughput material screening methodology offers insights into the impact of morphological anisotropy on interfacial mass transfer and electron transfer kinetics in plasmonic&#8208;assisted electrochemistry.







Abstract
The key to rationally and rapidly designing high&#8208;performance materials is the monitoring and comprehension of dynamic processes within individual particles in real&#8208;time, particularly to gain insight into the anisotropy of nanoparticles. The intrinsic property of nanoparticles typically varies from one crystal facet to the next under realistic working conditions. Here, we introduce the operando collision electrochemistry to resolve the single silver nanoprisms (Ag NPs) anisotropy in photoelectrochemistry. We directly identify the effect of anisotropy on the plasmonic&#8208;assisted electrochemistry at the single NP/electrolyte interface. The statistical collision frequency shows that heterogeneous diffusion coefficients among crystal facets facilitate Ag NPs to undergo direction&#8208;dependent mass transfer toward the gold ultramicroelectrode. Subsequently, the current amplitudes of transient events indicate that the anisotropy enables variations in dynamic interfacial electron transfer behaviors during photothermal processes. The results presented here demonstrate that the measurement precision of collision electrochemistry can be extended to the sub&#8208;nanoparticle level, highlighting the potential for high&#8208;throughput material screening with comprehensive kinetics information at the nanoscale.

         <title>Umpolung&#8208;Enabled Divergent Dearomative Carbonylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dearomative carbonylation mode involving sequential nucleophile/nucleophile addition across benzene &#960;&#8208;bonds enables the divergent synthesis of esters and amides by tolerating a broad spectrum of benzene derivatives, nucleophilic partners, alcohols, and amines. The versatility of the process further allows for the tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes and the construction of quaternary carbon centers.







Abstract
Although dearomative functionalizations enable the direct conversion of flat aromatics into precious three&#8208;dimensional architectures, the case for simple arenes remains largely underdeveloped owing to the high aromatic stabilization energy. We herein report a dearomative sequential addition of two nucleophiles to arene &#960;&#8208;bonds through umpolung of chromium&#8211;arene complexes. This mode enables divergent dearomative carbonylation reactions of benzene derivatives by tolerating various nucleophiles in combination with alcohols or amines under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, thus providing modular access to functionalized esters or amides. The tunable synthesis of 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes as well as the construction of carbon quaternary centers further highlight the versatility of this dearomatization. Diverse late&#8208;stage modifications and derivatizations towards synthetically challenging and bioactive molecules reveal the synthetic utility. A possible mechanism was proposed based on control experiments and intermediate tracking.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Selective Radical C&#8722;C Coupling from Carboxylic Acids with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual nickel/photoredox catalyzed selective radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed with readily available carboxylic acids and their NHPI ester derivatives as coupling partners. This synergistic catalysis enables the mild and efficient building of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds or C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, affording structurally complex ketones and congested products with all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.







Abstract
Controlling the cross&#8208;coupling reaction between two different radicals is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the process occurring statistically, which would lead to three products, including two homocoupling products and one cross&#8208;coupling product.

     alt="Nickel-Catalyzed Highly Selective Radical C&#8722;C Coupling from Carboxylic Acids with Photoredox Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual nickel/photoredox catalyzed selective radical-radical cross-coupling reaction has been developed with readily available carboxylic acids and their NHPI ester derivatives as coupling partners. This synergistic catalysis enables the mild and efficient building of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds or C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds, affording structurally complex ketones and congested products with all-carbon quaternary centers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the cross-coupling reaction between two different radicals is a long-standing challenge due to the process occurring statistically, which would lead to three products, including two homocoupling products and one cross-coupling product. Generally, the cross-coupling selectivity is achieved by the persistent radical effect (PRE) that requires the presence of a persistent radical and a transient radical, thus resulting in limited radical precursors. In this paper, a highly selective cross-coupling of alkyl radicals with acyl radicals to construct C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds, or with alkyl radicals to construct C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds have been achieved with the readily available carboxylic acids and their derivatives (NHPI ester) as coupling partners. The success originates from the use of tridentate ligand (2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;-terpyridine) to enable radical cross-coupling process to Ni-mediated organometallic mechanism. This protocol offers a facile and flexible access to structurally diverse ketones (up to 90&#8201;% yield), and also a new solution for the challenging double decarboxylative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling.

         <dc:description>
A series of pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) with different skeleton torsion&#8208;angles have been rationally prepared, which exhibits significant differences in its exciton behavior, reactive oxygen species, photocatalytic activity, and mechanisms. It provides a valuable reference and inspiration for the rational design of novel, high&#8208;efficiency, and high&#8208;selectivity CPPs photocatalysts.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in determining photocatalytic reaction pathways, intermediate species, and product selectivity. However, research on ROS regulation in polymer photocatalysts is still in its early stages. Herein, we successfully achieved series of modulations to the skeleton of Pyrene&#8208;alkyne&#8208;based (Tetraethynylpyrene (TEPY)) conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) by altering the linkers (1,4&#8208;dibromobenzene (BE), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (IP), and 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dibromobiphenyl (BP)). Experiments combined with theoretical calculations indicate that BE&#8208;TEPY exhibits a planar structure with minimal exciton binding energy, which favors exciton dissociation followed by charge transfer with adsorbed O2 to produce &#8901;O2&#8722;. Thus BE&#8208;TEPY shows optimal photocatalytic activity for phenylboronic acid oxidation and [3+2] cycloaddition. Conversely, the skeleton of BP&#8208;TEPY is significantly distorted. Its planar conjugation decreases, intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency increases, which makes it more prone for resonance energy transfer to generate 1O2. Therefore, BP&#8208;TEPY displays best photocatalytic activity in [4+2] cycloaddition and thioanisole oxidation. Both above reactant conversion and its product selectivity exceed 99&#8201;%. This work systematically reveals the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationship among the skeleton structure of CPPs, excitonic behavior, and selective generation of ROS, providing new insights for the rational design of highly efficient and selective CPPs photocatalysts.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Chelating Intermediate for Air&#8208;Processed Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the lead&#8208;chelating intermediate phase promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at ambient air, bypassing the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. The crystallinity of perovskites and the &#945;&#8208;phase stability are remarkably improved. Consequently, the ambient&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.08&#8201;%, along with the high open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.19&#8197;V).







Abstract
Formamidinium&#8208;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite holds promise as a prime candidate in the realm of perovskite photovoltaics. However, the photo&#8208;active &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase, existing as a metastable state, is observable solely at elevated temperatures and is susceptible to degradation into the &#948;&#8208;phase in ambient air. Therefore, the attainment of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 in ambient conditions has become a crucial objective in perovskite research. Here, we proposed an efficient conversion process of PbI2 into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskites in ambient air. This conversion was facilitated by the introduction of chelating molecules, which interacted with PbI2 to form an intermediate phase. Due to the reduced formation barrier resulting from the altered reaction pathway, this stable intermediate phase transitioned directly into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 upon the deposition of the organic cation solution, effectively bypassing the formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Consequently, the ambient&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibited an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.08&#8201;%, along with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V. Furthermore, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated remarkable environmental stability. Notably, this innovative approach promises broad applicability across various chelating molecules, opening new avenues for further progress in the ambient air fabrication of FAPbI3 PSCs.

Designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY and strong crystallinity can effectively reduce non&#8208;radiative energy losses and enhance OSC performance. We synthesized DM&#8208;F, an A&#8211;D&#8211;A fused&#8208;ring acceptor, which hinders H&#8208;aggregate formation, boosts PLQY, and shows strong near&#8208;infrared absorption and crystallinity. DM&#8208;F&#8208;based OSCs exhibit low &#9653;Enr (0.14&#8197;eV) and high PCE, reaching 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;% in binary and ternary cells, respectively.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing narrow band gap acceptors that exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and strong crystallinity is a highly effective, yet challenging, approach to reducing non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#9653;Enr) and boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). We have successfully designed and synthesized an A&#8211;D&#8211;A type fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, named DM&#8208;F, which features a planar molecular backbone adorned with bulky three&#8208;dimensional camphane side groups at its central core. These bulky substituents effectively hinder the formation of H&#8208;aggregates of the acceptors, promoting the formation of more J&#8208;aggregates and notably elevating the PLQY of the acceptor in the film. As anticipated, DM&#8208;F showcases pronounced near&#8208;infrared absorption coupled with impressive crystallinity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) leveraging DM&#8208;F exhibit a high EQEEL value and remarkably low &#9653;Enr of 0.14&#8197;eV&#8208;currently the most minimal reported value for OSCs. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary and ternary OSCs utilizing DM&#8208;F has reached 16.16&#8201;% and 20.09&#8201;%, respectively, marking a new apex in reported efficiency within the OSCs field. In conclusion, our study reveals that designing narrow band gap acceptors with high PLQY is an effective way to reduce &#9653;Enr and improve the PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Chemoselective and Stereoselective Allylation of Bis(alkenyl)boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylation of bis&#8208;alkenyl boronates proceeds with high group selectivity (migration of the more substituted olefin), enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. The resultant optically active tertiary allylic boron reagent can participate in transformations through either direct substitution of the boron or through allylic functionalization.

Bis(alkenyl)boronates react with optically active Ir(&#960;&#8208;allyl) species in a process that involves allylation of the more substituted olefin and 1,2&#8208;metalate shift of the less substituted olefin. The method constructs valuable enantioenriched tertiary allylic boronic esters with high chemoselectivity, enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Allylic functionalization reactions transform the 1,3&#8208;stereodiad to 1,5&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;stereochemical relationships.

     alt="Chemoselective and Stereoselective Allylation of Bis(alkenyl)boronates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ir-catalyzed allylation of bis-alkenyl boronates proceeds with high group selectivity (migration of the more substituted olefin), enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. The resultant optically active tertiary allylic boron reagent can participate in transformations through either direct substitution of the boron or through allylic functionalization. Cyclic and acyclic products are formed with up to five new stereocenters created.

         <title>Manipulating Atomic&#8208;Coupling in Dual&#8208;Cavity Boride Nanoreactor to Achieve Hierarchical Catalytic Engineering for Sulfur Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique cascaded dual&#8208;cavity boride nanoreactor is rationally designed as a sulfur host, which achieves controlled catalysis in the heterogeneous catalytic system of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The coupling between atoms regulates catalyst activity and suppresses Li2S passivation. The mechanism and application investigation of nanoreactor provides a guiding strategy for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic process of Li2S formation is considered a key pathway to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Due to the system&#8216;s complexity, the catalytic behavior is uncertain, posing significant challenges for predicting activity. Herein, we report a novel cascaded dual&#8208;cavity nanoreactor (NiCo&#8722;B) by controlling reaction kinetics, providing an opportunity for achieving hierarchical catalytic behavior. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, the multilevel structure can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and accelerate sulfur conversion. Furthermore, we differentiate the adsorption (B&#8722;S) and catalytic effect (Co&#8722;S) in NiCo&#8722;B, avoiding catalyst deactivation caused by excessive adsorption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared battery displays high reversible capacity, even with sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (E/S=4&#8197;&#956;l&#8201;mg&#8722;1), the areal capacity can reach 18.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Mechanochemical Backbone Editing for Controlled Degradation of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrocarbon backbone of vinyl polymers can be edited by mechanical force to achieve controlled degradation, wherein the cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide comonomer can be incorporated into the backbone of vinyl polymers through a photo&#8208;iniferter RAFT copolymerization pathway. The key aspect is that the cyclobutane units preserve the integrity of the polymer backbone during material application, while the cleavable imide groups can be selectively exposed through backbone editing upon mechanochemical activation. Subsequent hydrolysis of the imides facilitates efficient degradation and upcycling, resulting in the production of telechelic oligomers. This research holds the potential to inspire the design and modification of vinyl polymers through backbone editing.







Abstract
The chemically inert nature of fully saturated hydrocarbon backbones endows vinyl polymers with desirable durability, but it also leads to their significant environmental persistence. Enhancing the sustainability of these materials requires a pivotal yet challenging shift: transforming the inert backbone into one that is degradable. Here, we present a versatile platform for mechanochemically editing the fully saturated backbone of vinyl polymers towards degradable polymer chains by integrating cyclobutene&#8208;fused succinimide (CBS) units along backbone through photo&#8208;iniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) copolymerization. Significantly, the evenly insertion of CBS units does not compromise thermal or chemical stability but rather offers a means to adjust the properties of polymethylacrylate (PMA). Meanwhile, reactive acyclic imide units can be selectively introduced to the backbone through mechanochemical activation (pulse ultrasonication or ball&#8208;milling grinding) when required. Subsequent hydrolysis of the acyclic imide groups enables efficient degradation, yielding telechelic oligomers. This approach holds promise for inspiring the design and modification of more environmentally friendly vinyl polymers through backbone editing.

         <title>20.1&#8201;% Certified Efficiency of Planar Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells by Spacer Cation Chain Length Engineering of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cation is proposed to achieve systematic control of key properties of 2D perovskite in 3D/2D perovskite heterojunctions. The 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium spacer cations realizes the optimal balance between defect passivation, energy level structure, and charge transport. The planar hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon electrode perovskite solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.40&#8201;%.







Abstract
The planar triple&#8208;layer hole transport layer (HTL)&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have outstanding advantages of low cost and high stability, but are limited by low efficiency. The formation of a 3D/2D heterojunction has been widely proven to enhance device performance. However, the 2D perovskite possesses multiple critical properties associated with 3D perovskite, including defect passivation, energy level, and charge transport properties, all of which can impact device performance. It is challenging to find a powerful means to achieve comprehensive regulation and trade&#8208;off of these key properties. Herein, we propose a chain&#8208;length engineering of alkylammonium spacer cations to achieve this goal. The results show that the 2D perovskite formed by short&#8208;chain alkylammonium cations primarily acts to passivate defects. With the increase in cation chain length, the 2D perovskite achieves a more matched energy level with 3D perovskite, enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and promoting charge separation. However, the further increase in chain length impedes the charge transport due to the insulativity of organic cations. Comprehensively, the 2D perovskite formed by tetradecylammonium cations achieves the optimal balance of defect passivation, interface charge separation, and charge transport. The planar HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs exhibit a new record efficiency of 20.40&#8201;% (certified 20.1&#8201;%).

         <title>Synergy of Photogenerated Electrons and Holes toward Efficient Photocatalytic Urea Synthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a catalyst consisting of WO3 and Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;decorated CdS, the N2 is converted into NO species by &#8901;OH radicals generated from photogenerated holes, meanwhile the CO2 is transformed into *CO species by photogenerated electrons. The generated NO and *CO species are further coupled and gradually transformed into urea.







Abstract
Directly coupling N2 and CO2 to synthesize urea by photocatalysis paves a sustainable route for urea synthesis, but its performance is limited by the competition of photogenerated electrons between N2 and CO2, as well as the underutilized photogenerated holes. Herein, we report an efficient urea synthesis process involving photogenerated electrons and holes in respectively converting CO2 and N2 over a redox heterojunction consisting of WO3 and Ni single&#8208;atom&#8208;decorated CdS (Ni1&#8208;CdS/WO3). For the photocatalytic urea synthesis from N2 and CO2 in pure water, Ni1&#8208;CdS/WO3 attained a urea yield rate of 78&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 0.15&#8201;% at 385&#8197;nm, which ranked among the best photocatalytic urea synthesis performance reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that the N2 was converted into NO species by &#8901;OH radicals generated from photogenerated holes over the WO3 component, meanwhile, the CO2 was transformed into *CO species over the Ni site by photogenerated electrons. The generated NO and *CO species were further coupled to form *OCNO intermediate, then gradually transformed into urea. This work emphasizes the importance of reasonably utilizing photogenerated holes in photocatalytic reduction reactions.

         <title>Atomically Precise Chiral Metal Nanoclusters for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag7) were successfully prepared and utilized as photoactive materials for direct CPL detection. The R/S&#8208;Ag7&#8208;based photodetectors show effective discrimination between RCP and LCP lights with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This work demonstrates the direct detection of CPL by metal clusters for the first time, paving the way for the application of chiral metal clusters in CPL detection.







Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection is of great significance in various applications such as drug identification, sensing and imaging. Atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters with intense circular dichroism (CD) signals are promising candidates for CPL detection, which can further facilitate device miniaturization and integration. Herein, we report the preparation of a pair of optically active chiral silver nanoclusters [Ag7(R/S&#8208;DMA)2(dpppy)3] (BF4)3 (R/S&#8208;Ag7) for direct CPL detection. The crystal structure and molecular formula of R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. R/S&#8208;Ag7 clusters exhibit strong CD spectra and CPL both in solution and solid states. When used as the photoactive materials in photodetectors, R/S&#8208;Ag7 enables effective discrimination between left&#8208;handed circularly polarized and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light at 520&#8197;nm with short response time, high responsivity and considerable discrimination ratio. This study is the first report on using atomically precise chiral metal nanoclusters for CPL detection.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Bridged Cyclobutanes by Lewis Acid Catalyzed Formal Cycloadditions of Pyridinium 1,4&#8208;Zwitterionic Thiolates and Bicyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent synthesis of two types of sulfur&#8208;containing bridged cyclobutanes, 2&#8208;thia&#8208;5&#8208;azabicyclo[5.1.1]nonenes and thia&#8208;norpinenes from identical bicyclobutanes (BCBs), respectively, through high&#8208;order(5+3) and hetero&#8208;(3+3) reactions, has been developed.







Abstract
Bridged cyclobutanes and sulfur heterocycles are currently under intense investigation as building blocks for pharmaceutical drug design. Two formal cycloaddition modes involving bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate derivatives were described to rapidly expand the chemical space of sulfur&#8208;containing bridged cyclobutanes. By using Ni(ClO4)2 as the catalyst, an uncommon higher&#8208;order (5+3) cycloaddition of BCBs with quinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate was achieved with broad substrate scope under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric polar (5+3) cycloaddition of BCB with pyridazinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate was accomplished. In contrast, pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates undergo an Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal (3+3) reaction with BCBs to generate thia&#8208;norpinene products, which represent the initial instance of synthesizing 2&#8208;thiabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (thia&#8208;BCHeps) from BCBs. Moreover, we have successfully used this (3+3) protocol to rapidly prepare thia&#8208;BCHeps&#8208;substituted analogues of the bioactive molecule Pitofenone. Density functional theory (DFT) computations imply that kinetic factors govern the (5+3) cycloaddition reaction between BCB and quinolinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolate, whereas the (3+3) reaction involving pyridinium 1,4&#8208;zwitterionic thiolates is under thermodynamic control.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Locked Fluorescent Probes Activated by Aminopeptidase N and the Tumor Redox Environment for High&#8208;Precision Imaging of Tumor Boundaries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of offensive and defensive integration (ODI) strategy&#8208;based fluorescent probes depending on the &#8220;attack and defense systems&#8221; required for the persistence of tumors is reported. FANQ was screened for tumor imaging, distinguishing between cancerous tissue and adjacent tissue with an obvious tumor boundary.







Abstract
Clear delineation of tumor margins is essential for accurate resection and decreased recurrence rate in the clinic. Fluorescence imaging is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional visual inspection by surgeons for intraoperative imaging. However, traditional probes lack accuracy in tumor diagnosis, making it difficult to depict tumor boundaries accurately. Herein, we proposed an offensive and defensive integration (ODI) strategy based on the &#8220;attack systems (invasive peptidase) and defense systems (reductive microenvironment)&#8221; of multi&#8208;dimensional tumor characteristics to design activatable fluorescent probes for imaging tumor boundaries precisely. Screened out from a series of ODI strategy&#8208;based probes, ANQ performed better than traditional probes based on tumor unilateral correlation by distinguishing between tumor cells and normal cells and minimizing false&#8208;positive signals from living metabolic organs. To further improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in vivo, derivatized FANQ, was prepared and successfully applied to distinguish orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from adjacent tissues in mice models and clinical samples. This work highlights an innovative strategy to develop activatable probes for rapid diagnosis of tumors and high&#8208;precision imaging of tumor boundaries, providing more efficient tools for future clinical applications in intraoperative assisted resection.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal Nanowire Networks by Microfluidic Laminar Flow Synthesis for Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 2D MNWNs in microfluidic systems through precise control of growth kinetics via spatial confinement and shear&#8208;induced phenomena. A novel approach for the direct synthesis of ultra&#8208;large two&#8208;dimensional metal nanowire networks (2D MNWNs) catalysts was developed based on spatial confinement assembly and laminar shear effect. The PdBi 2D MNWNs affords the exceptional activity and stability for formic acid electrooxidation. The present study expands the potential applications in nanomaterial production through microfluidics.







Abstract
Despite the great research interest in two&#8208;dimensional metal nanowire networks (2D MNWNs) due to their large specific surface area and abundance of unsaturated coordination atoms, their controllable synthesis still remains a significant challenge. Herein, a microfluidics laminar flow&#8208;based approach is developed, enabling the facile preparation of large&#8208;scale 2D structures with diverse alloy compositions, such as PtBi, AuBi, PdBi, PtPdBi, and PtAuCu alloys. Remarkably, these 2D MNWNs can reach sizes up to submillimeter scale (~220&#8197;&#956;m), which is significantly larger than the evolution from the 1D or 3D counterparts that typically measure only tens of nanometers. The PdBi 2D MNWNs affords the highest specific activity for formic acid (2669.1&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1) among current unsupported catalysts, which is 103.5 times higher than Pt&#8208;black, respectively. Furthermore, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments provide comprehensive evidence that PdBi 2D MNWNs catalysts can effectively prevent CO* poisoning, resulting in exceptional activity and stability for the oxidation of formic acid.

         <title>Revisiting the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy of Porous Electrodes in Li&#8208;ion Batteries by Employing Reference Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), characterized by its non&#8208;destructive and in&#8208;situ nature, plays a crucial role in comprehending the thermodynamic and kinetic processes occurring with Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, there is a lack of consistent and coherent physical interpretations for the EIS of porous electrodes. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct thorough investigations into the underlying physical mechanisms of EIS. Herein, by employing reference electrode in batteries, we revisit the associated physical interpretation of EIS at different frequency. Combining different battery configurations, temperature&#8208;dependent experiments, and elaborated distribution of relaxation time analysis, we find that the ion transport in porous electrode channels and pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior dominate the high&#8208;frequency and mid&#8208;frequency impedance arcs, respectively. This work offers a perspective for the physical interpretation of EIS and also sheds light on the understanding of EIS characteristics in other advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Non&#8208;Covalent and Covalent Binding of New Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;like Polyoxidovanadate Clusters to Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of lysozyme, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange and partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates. Eugenio Garribba, Antonello Merlino et al. report in this Communication (e202406669) the X&#8208;ray structures of three mixed&#8208;valence species: [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which interacts non&#8208;covalently with the protein, and [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which are covalently bound.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we describe an efficient and modular method for enantiodivergent accessing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules by utilizing the catalytic atroposelective Catellani&#8208;type C&#8722;H arylation/desymmetric intramolecular N&#8208;arylation cascade reaction. The enantioselectivity of this protocol was proved to be tuned by the polarity of the solvent, thus providing a wide range of both chiral P(V)&#8208;stereogenic enantiomers in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantiomeric excesses. Noteworthy is that the strategy developed herein represents an unprecedented example of solvent&#8208;dictated inversion of the enantioselectivity of P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridone&#8208;Derived Endoperoxide Suppressing both Lung Cancer and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression by Three&#8208;Pronged Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an endoperoxide compound (E5) which can deliver three therapeutic components by a thermal cycloreversion, namely, singlet oxygen, triplet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone, thus targeting multiple mechanisms for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In aqueous environment, E5 undergoes clean reaction to afford three therapeutic components with a half&#8208;life of 8.3 hours without the generation of other by&#8208;products, which not only achieves good cytotoxicity toward lung cancer cells and decreases the levels of HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein, but also inhibits the TGF&#8208;&#946;1 induced fibrosis in vitro. In vivo experiments also demonstrated the efficacy of E5 in inhibiting tumor growth and relieving idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while exhibiting good biocompatibility. Many lines of evidence reveal the therapeutic efficacy of singlet oxygen and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone, and triplet oxygen could downregulate HIF&#8208;1&#945; and relieve tumor hypoxia which is a critical issue in conventional PDT. Unlike other combination therapies, in which multiple therapeutic agents are given in independent formulations, our work demonstrates single molecule endoperoxide prodrugs could be developed as new platforms for treatment of cancers and related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiplexed and Quantitative Imaging of Live&#8208;Cell Membrane Proteins by a Precise and Controllable DNA&#8208;Encoded Amplification Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amplifying DNA conjugated affinity ligands can improve the sensitivity and multiplicity of cell imaging and play a crucial role in comprehensively deciphering cellular heterogeneity and dynamic changes during development and disease. However, the development of one&#8208;step, controllable, and quantitative DNA amplification methods for multiplexed imaging of live&#8208;cell membrane proteins is challenging. Here, we introduce the template adhesion reaction (TAR) method for assembling amplifiable DNA sequences with different affinity ligands, such as aptamers or antibodies, for amplified and multiplexed imaging of live&#8208;cell membrane proteins with high quantitative fidelity. The precisely controllable TAR enables proportional amplification of membrane protein targets with variable abundances by modulating the concentration ratios of hairpin templates and primers, thus allowing sensitive visualization of multiple membrane proteins with enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNRs) without disturbing their original ratios. Using TAR, we achieved signal&#8208;enhanced imaging of six proteins on the same live&#8208;cell within 1&#8208;2 h. TAR represents an innovative and programmable molecular toolkit for multiplexed profiling of membrane proteins in live&#8208;cells</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Nanozymes for Organic Substrates: Building Nano&#8208;organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of the first peroxidase nanozyme (Fe3O4), numerous nanomaterials have been reported to exhibit intrinsic enzyme&#8208;like activity toward inorganic oxygen species, such as H2O2, oxygen, and O2&#8226;&#8208;. However, the exploration of nanozymes targeting organic compounds holds transformative potential in the realm of industrial synthesis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse types of nanozymes that catalyze reactions involving&#160;organic substrates and discusses their catalytic mechanisms, structure&#8208;activity relationships, and methodological paradigms for discovering new nanozymes. Additionally, we propose a forward&#8208;looking perspective on designing nanozyme formulations to mimic subcellular organelles, such as chloroplasts, termed &#8220;nano&#8208;organelles&#8221;. Finally, we analyze the challenges encountered in nanozyme synthesis, characterization, nano&#8208;organelle construction and applications while suggesting directions to overcome these obstacles and enhance nanozyme research in the future. Through this review, our goal is to inspire further research efforts and catalyze advancements in the field of nanozymes, fostering new insights and opportunities in chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Halo&#8208;Halodifluoromethylation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Fluorinated Carboxylic Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyhalogenated molecules are often found as bioactive compounds in nature and are used as synthetic building blocks. Fluoroalkyl compounds hold promise for the development of novel pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups is known to improve lipophilicity, membrane permeability, and metabolic stability. Three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;halo&#8208;halodifluoromethylation reactions of alkenes are useful for their synthesis. However, general methods enabling the introduction of halodifluoromethyl (CF2X) and halogen (X&#8217;) groups in the desired combination of X and X&#8217; are lacking. To address this gap, for the first time, we report a three&#8208;component halo&#8208;halodifluoromethylation of alkenes and alkynes using combinations of commercially available fluorinated carboxylic anhydrides ((CF2XCO)2O, X = Cl and Br) and alkali metal halides (X&#8217; = Cl and Br). In situ prepared fluorinated diacyl peroxides were identified as important intermediates, and the use of appropriate bipyridyl&#8208;based ligands and a copper catalyst was essential for achieving high product selectivity. The synthetic utility of the polyhalogenated products was demonstrated by exploiting differences in the reactivities of their C&#8211;X and C&#8211;X&#8217; bonds to achieve selective derivatization. Finally, the reaction mechanism and ligand effect were investigated using experimental and theoretical methods to provide important insights for the further development of catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO = 97.3%) to formate (FEformate = 93.5%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1 M KBr&#8208;0.5 M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1 M CsBr&#8208;0.5M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Reversible, Degenerative Chain Transfer Mechanism for the Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most metathesis polymers based on norbornene derivatives carry a vinyl end group. Here we show that these vinyl end groups readily undergo a degenerative exchange of the terminal methylene unit in the presence of sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of a propagating metathesis polymer carrying a Grubbs ruthenium complex. We show that this degenerative exchange can be exploited in synthesizing ROMP polymers in a catalytic living fashion. Chain transfer agents based on styrene, or monosubstituted conjugated 1,3 diene derivatives are used as initiating sites for the catalytic living polymerization. Suitable derivatives of these chain transfer agents not only allow the linear living growth of polymers but also the synthesis of block copolymers from macro&#8208;initiators or star polymers from multi&#8208;functional chain transfer agents. This reversible exchange mechanism offers a cheaper, greener, and more sustainable alternative for the synthesis of living ROMP polymers compared to the classical synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strep&#8208;tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising&#8208;strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tag labeled enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>7&#8208;Aminoindoles are important synthetic intermediates to a broad range of bioactive molecules. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8211;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH2 group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron&#8208;aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1 mol% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8722;B and C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization of PolyBorylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult. In this regard, numerous synthetic methodologies have been developed to construct carbon&#8211;carbon bonds with regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, enabling the predictable and efficient synthesis of stereodefined alkenes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult. In this regard, numerous synthetic methodologies have been developed to construct carbon&#8211;carbon bonds with regio- and stereoselectivity, enabling the predictable and efficient synthesis of stereodefined alkenes. In fact, an appealing alternative approach for accessing challenging stereodefined alkenes molecular frameworks could involve the sequential selective activation and cross-coupling of strong bonds instead of conventional C&#8211;C bond formation. In this study, we introduce a series of programmed site- and stereoselective strategies that capitalizes on the versatile reactivity of readily accessible polymetalloid alkenes (i.e. polyborylated alkenes), through a tandem cross-coupling reaction, which is catalyzed by an organometallic Rh-complex to produce complex molecular scaffolds. By merging selective C&#8211;B and remote C&#8211;H bond functionalization, we achieve the in-situ generation of polyfunctional C(sp2)-nucleophilic intermediates. These species can be further modified by selective coupling reactions with various C-based electrophiles, enabling the formation of C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bond for the generation of even more complex molecular architectures using the readily available starting polyborylated-alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies have provided insight into the origins of the stereoselectivities and C&#8211;H activation via a 1,4-Rh migration process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Ultrafast Photoinduced Small Polarons to Cooperative and Macroscopic Charge&#8208;Transfer Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy the ultrafast and persistent photoinduced phase transition of the Rb0.94Mn0.94Co0.06[Fe(CN)6]0.98&#8729;0.2H2O material, induced at room temperature by a single laser shot. This system exhibits a charge&#8208;transfer based phase transition with a 75 K wide thermal hysteresis, centred at room temperature, from the low temperature Mn3+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ tetragonal phase to the high temperature Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+ cubic phase. At room temperature, the photoinduced phase transition is persistent. However, the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamics leading to this phase is multi&#8208;scale. Femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, particularly sensitive to local reorganizations through the evolution of the frequency of the N&#8722;C vibration modes with the different characteristic electronic states, reveals that at low laser fluence and on short time scale, the photoexcitation of the Mn3+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ phase creates small charge&#8208;transfer polarons [Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+]* within &#8771; 250 fs. The local trapping of photoinduced intermetallic charge&#8208;transfer is characterized by the appearance of a polaronic infrared band, due to the surrounding Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe2+ species. Above a threshold fluence, when a critical fraction of small CT&#8208;polarons is reached, the macroscopic phase transition to the persistent Mn2+&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8722;Fe3+ cubic phase occurs within &#8771; 100 ps. This non&#8208;linear photo&#8208;response results from elastic cooperativity, intrinsic to a switchable lattice and reminiscent of a feedback mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt; 500 nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P = methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475 nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8210; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8210; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495 nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450 nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54 &#215; KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064 nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5 &#956;Gy/s).

         <dc:description>Efficient synthesis of H2O2 via photocatalytic oxygen reduction without sacrificial agents is challenging due to inadequate proton supply from water and difficulty in maintaining O&#8722;O bond during O2 activation. Herein, we developed a straightforward strategy involving a proton&#8208;rich hydrogel cross&#8208;linked by metal ions [M(n)], which is designed to facilitate the selective production of H2O2 through proton relay and metal ion&#8208;assisted detachment of crucial intermediates. The hydrogel comprises CdS/graphene and alginate cross&#8208;linked by metal ions via O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds. Efficient O2 reduction and hydrogenation occurred, benefitting from the collaboration between proton&#8208;rich alginate and the photocatalytically active CdS/graphene. Meanwhile, the O=C&#8722;O&#8722;M(n) bonds enhance the electron density of &#945;&#8208;carbon sites on graphene, crucial for O2 activation and *OOH intermediate detachment, preventing deeper O&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Engineered Cellular Vesicles Displaying Glycosylated Nanobodies for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis represents an alluring avenue for cancer immunotherapy. However, the compromised efficacy and safety concerns in vivo of conventional anti&#8208;CD47 antibodies impede their wide clinical applications. Here we introduced a single type of high&#8208;mannose glycans into the nanobodies against CD47 (HM&#8208;nCD47) and subsequently displayed HM&#8208;nCD47 on cellular vesicles (CVs) for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. In this platform, the CVs significantly improved the circulation time of HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs, the nCD47 enabled the blockade of the CD47/SIRP&#945; axis, and the HM enhanced recognition of mannose&#8208;binding lectin, all synergistically activating the macrophage&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. In both subcutaneous and metastatic murine tumor models, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs possessed significantly extended half&#8208;lives and increased accumulation at the tumor site, resulting in a remarkable macrophage&#8208;dependent inhibition of tumor growth, a transcriptomic remodeling of the immune response, and an increase in survival time. By integrating the chemical biology toolbox with cell membrane nanotechnology, the HM&#8208;nCD47&#8208;CVs represent a new immunotherapeutic platform for cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate&#160;Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid headgroup. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Transition between Multiple Conductance States and Rectifying Behaviors in an Artificial Single&#8208;Molecule Funnel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It has long been an aspirational goal to create artificial channel structures that replicate the feat achieved by ion channel proteins. Biological ion channels occasionally demonstrate multiple conductance states (known as subconductance), remaining a challenging property to achieve in artificial channel molecules. We report a funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. Planar lipid bilayer measurements reveal distinct current recordings, including a closed state, two conducting states, and spontaneous transitions between the three states, resembling the events seen in biological ion channels. The transitions result from conformational changes induced by chloride transport in the channel molecule. Both opening states show a non&#8208;linear and rectifying I&#8208;V relationship, indicating voltage&#8208;dependent transport due to the asymmetrical channel structure. This work could enhance our understanding of ion permeation and channel opening mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Triply Interlocked [2]catenanes: Rational Synthesis, Reversible Conversion Studies and Unprecedented Application in Photothermal Responsive Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triply interlocked [2]catenane exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance was constructed and used as photothermal units in the creation of light&#8208;driven, versatile soft actuators within thermal stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Triply interlocked [2]catenane complexes featuring two identical, mechanically interlocked units are extraordinarily rare chemical compounds, whose properties and applications remain open to detailed studies. Herein, we introduce the rational design of a new ligand precursor, L1, suitable for the synthesis of six triply interlocked [2]catenanes by coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The interlocked compounds can be reversibly converted into the corresponding simple triangular prism metallacage by addition of H2O or DMF solvents to their CH3OH solutions, thereby demonstrating the importance of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions in the formation of triply interlocked [2]catenanes. Moreover, extensive studies have been conducted to assess the remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Complex 6&#8201;a, exhibiting outstanding photothermal conversion performance (conversion efficiency in solution : 31.82&#8201;%), is used to prepare novel photoresponsive elastomer in combination with thermally activated liquid crystal elastomer. The resultant material displays robust response to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser and the capability of completely reforming the shape and reversible actuation, paving the way for the application of half&#8208;sandwich organometallic units in photo&#8208;responsive smart materials.

         <title>Inside Cover Picture: Modulating the Electrolyte Microenvironment in Electrical Double Layer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally regulating the electrolyte microenvironment is an effective approach to boost the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance. In their Research Article (e202408382), Xin&#8208;Yao Yu and co&#8208;workers propose a novel strategy to enhance the NO3RR performance by mediating alkali metal cations in the electrolyte. In the presence of K+, the protons are more favorable to cross the electric double layer to reach the catalyst surface and conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; is promoted, thereby favoring the overall kinetics of NO3RR.

         <title>3D Lead&#8208;Organoselenide&#8208;Halide Perovskites and their Mixed&#8208;Chalcogenide and Mixed&#8208;Halide Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We incorporate Se into the 3D halide perovskite framework using the zwitterionic ligand: SeCYS (+NH3(CH2)2Se&#8722;), which occupies both the X&#8722; and A+ sites in the prototypical ABX3 perovskite. The new organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites: (SeCYS)PbX2 (X = Cl, Br) expand upon the recently discovered organosulfide&#8208;halide perovskites. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis reveal the average structures of the organoselenide&#8208;halide perovskites, whereas the local lead coordination environments and their distributions were probed through solid&#8208;state 77Se and 207Pb NMR, complemented by theoretical simulations. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the band structures of (SeCYS)PbX2 largely resemble those of their S analogs, with similar band dispersion patterns, yet with a considerable bandgap decrease. Optical absorbance measurements indeed show bandgaps of 2.07 and 1.86 eV for (SeCYS)PbX2 with X = Cl and Br, respectively. We further demonstrate routes to alloying the halides (Cl, Br) and chalcogenides (S, Se) continuously tuning the bandgap from 1.86 to 2.31 eV&#8212;straddling the ideal range for tandem solar cells or visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The comprehensive description of the average and local structures, and how they can fine&#8208;tune the bandgap and potential trap states, respectively, establishes the foundation for understanding this new perovskite family, which combines solid&#8208;state and organo&#8208;main&#8208;group chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40 s&#8208;1 respectively, 8.6 times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8208;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic Ion Barrier&#8208;Enabled Ultradurable Zn (002) Plane Orientation towards Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Less Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gradual disability of Zn anode and high negative/positive electrode (N/P) ratio usually depreciate calendar life and energy density of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, within original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes, a steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating to solve this issue. Guided by theoretical simulations, hydrophobic adiponitrile (ADN) is employed as a steric hindrance agent to ally with inert electric field shielding additive (Mn2+) for plane adsorption priority manipulation, thereby constructing the &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221;. This design robustly suppresses the (002) plane/dendrite growth, enabling ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating. Even being cycled in Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cell over 2150 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, the efficacy remains well&#8208;kept. Additionally, Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cells can be also stably cycled over 918 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, verifying uncompromised Zn stripping/plating kinetics. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#183;2H2O full cells with a low N/P ratio (2:1) show a high energy density of 75.2 Wh kg&#8208;1full electrode after 842 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, far surpassing counterparts with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass, featuring excellent practicality. This study opens a new avenue by robust &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; design to develop long&#8208;life anode&#8208;less Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Enabled Droplet Biobattery for Powering Synthetic Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;enabled biobatteries are promising green options to power the next&#8208;generation of bioelectronics and implantable medical devices. However, existing power sources based on enzymatic biofuel chemistry exhibit limited scale&#8208;down feasibility due to the solid and bulky battery structures. Therefore, miniature and soft alternatives are needed for integration with implants and tissues. Here, a biobattery built from nanolitre droplets, fuelled by the enzyme&#8208;enabled oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, generates electrical outputs and powers ion fluxes in droplet networks. Optimization of the droplet biobattery components ensures a stable output current of ~13,000 pA for over 24 h, representing a more than 600&#8208;fold increase in output over previous approaches, including light&#8208;driven processes. The enzyme&#8208;enabled droplet biobattery opens new avenues in bioelectronics and bioiontronics, exemplified by tasks such as the ability to drive electrochemical signal transmission in integrated synthetic tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Se&#8208;Elemental Concentration Gradient Regulation for Efficient Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3), featuring large absorption coefficient, excellent crystal structure stability, benign non&#8208;toxic characteristic, outstanding humidity and ultraviolet tolerability, has recently attracted enormous attention and research interest regarding its photoelectric conversion properties. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) for Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is relatively low, especially for the device with a high power conversion efficiency (&#951;). Herein, an innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited to produce high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films on TiO2/CdS substrates through a thioacetamide(TA)&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source hydrothermal&#8208;processed method. The Se&#8208;elemental gradient distribution produces a favorable energy band structure, which suppresses the energy level barriers for hole transport and enhances the driving force for electron transport in Sb2(S,Se)3 film. This facilitates efficient charge transport/separation of photogenerated carriers and boosts significantly the Voc of Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaic devices. The champion TA&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cell displays an considerable &#951; of 9.28% accompanied by an exciting&#160;Voc rising to 0.70 V that is currently the highest among Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 9.0%. This research is anticipated to contribute to the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film and the achievement of efficient inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ photovoltaic device.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via Heterogeneous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogenous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143 times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON)&#160;the heterogeneous gallium (III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium (III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8208;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8208;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8208;CN, &#8208;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Acidity Regulation Enhances Electrocatalytic Performances of Alcohol Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local acidity at the anode surface during electrolysis is apparently stronger than that in bulk electrolyte due to the deprotonation from the reactant, which leads to the deteriorated electrocatalytic performances and product distributions. Here, an anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial acidity regulation strategy has been proposed to inhibit local acidification at the surface of anode and enhance the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of anodic reactions. As a proof of the concept, CeO2&#8208;x Lewis acid component has been employed as a supporter to load Au nanoparticles to accelerate the diffusion and enrichment of OH&#8208; toward the anode surface, so as to accelerate the electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation reaction. As the result, Au/CeO2&#8208;x exhibits much enhanced lactic acid selectivity of 81% and electrochemical activity of 693 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 current density in glycerol oxidation reaction compared to pure Au. Mechanism investigation reveals that the introduced Lewis acid promotes the mass transport and concentration of OH&#8208; on the anode surface, thus promoting the generation of lactic acid through the simultaneous enhancements of Faradaic and non&#8208;Faradaic processes. Attractively, the proposed strategy can be used for the electro&#8208;oxidation performance enhancements of a variety of alcohols, which thereby provides a new perspective for efficient alcohol electro&#8208;oxidations and the corresponding electrocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Versatile Synthesis of Thioamides by Radical Thiocarbamoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37 A&#183;mgpt&#8208;1 along with excellent stability during a 24 h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enable the Domino&#8208;Like Structural Recovering in Bismuth Anode to Achieve Fast and Durable Na/K Storages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk inlaid architecture with bismuth nanospheres enclosed in an N&#8208;doped bulk carbon (BiNC). Such a structure can enable the reversible Na3Bi&#8596;layered Bi phase transition triggered by the compressive stress&#8208;induced &#8220;domino&#8221; effect, thus suppress the irreversible structural evolutions to achieve an extraordinary cyclic stability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type anodes show capacity and density advantages for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs), but they encounter serious structural degradation upon cycling, which cannot be resolved through conventional nanostructuring techniques. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying, and report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume&#8208;expansion&#8208;resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction, and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10&#8201;%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a &#8220;domino&#8208;like&#8221; Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for SIBs, 848.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3&#8201;% for SIBs, 96.4&#8201;% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000&#8197;cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015&#8201;% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work provides new insights on the undesirable structural evolution, and proposes basic guidelines for design of the anti&#8208;degradation structure for alloy&#8208;type electrode materials.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Ultrafast Construction of Zinc Tungstate Interface Layer for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zincophilic ZnWO4 layer has been ultrafast in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (ZWO@Zn) by a facile solution reaction. The ZWO@Zn can effectively eliminate the zinc dendrites and side reactions by regulating interfacial electric field distribution and promoting the uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Constructing artificial solid electrolyte interface on the Zn anode surface is recognized as an appealing method to inhibit zinc dendrites and side reactions, whereas the current techniques are complex and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a robust and zincophilic zinc tungstate (ZnWO4) layer has been in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (denoted as ZWO@Zn) by an ultrafast chemical solution reaction. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ZWO layer can effectively modulate the interfacial electric field distribution and promote the Zn2+ uniform diffusion, thus facilitating the uniform Zn2+ nucleation and suppressing zinc dendrites. Besides, ZWO layer can prevent direct contact between the Zn/water and increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to eliminate side reactions. Consequently, the in situ constructed ZWO layer facilitates remarkable reversibility in the ZWO@Zn||Ti battery, achieving an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.36&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, unprecedented cycling lifespan exceeding 1800&#8197;h under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in ZWO@Zn||ZWO@Zn battery, and a steady and reliable operation of the overall ZWO@Zn||VS2 battery. The work provides a simple, low cost, and ultrafast pathway to crafting protective layers for driving advancements in aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.

We report a new family of 21&#8197;hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A = rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L = solvent ligand; B = Sb, Bi and Te), demonstrating high compositional and structural diversity. These materials have high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) attributed to the triplet radiative recombination from Sb or the emission of the RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a PLQY of 94&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are an extraordinary class of optoelectronic materials with extensive applications. To further diversify and study the in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property relations, we report here a new family of 21 zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A=rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L=solvent ligand; and B=Sb, Bi and Te). The RE(DMSO)8[BCl6] (RE=La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide) series shows broadband emission attributed to triplet radiative recombination from Sb and Bi, incorporating the characteristic emission of RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a staggering PL quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The pseudo&#8208;octahedral [SbCl5] with Cl vacancy in AII(DMSO)6[SbCl5] (AII=Mg, Ca and Mn) and the square pyramidal [SbCl5] in AII(TMSO)6[SbCl5] (TMSO=tetramethylene sulfoxide) enhance the stereoactive expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs of Sb3+, giving rise to the observation of dual&#8208;band emission of singlet and triplet emission, respectively. A series of Te(IV) analogues have been characterized, showing blue&#8208;light&#8208;excitable single&#8208;band emission. This work expands the materials space for hybrid bimetallic halides with an emphasis on harnessing the RE elements, and provides important insights into designing new emitters and regulating their properties.

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Dependent Dual&#8208;Phosphorescent Cu4 Nanocluster with Remarkable Piezochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressure, for the first time, was introduced into the atomically precise coinage metal copper(I) nanocluster [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) with intrinsic dual emission (DE) behavior to investigate the origin of DE phenomena. We observed interesting pressure&#8208;dependent optical variations and obvious piezochromism. This research provides a theoretical reference for designing novel DE materials in the future.







Abstract
The dual emission (DE) characteristics of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) are of significant theoretical and practical interest. Despite this, the underlying mechanism driving DE in Cu NCs remains elusive, primarily due to the complexities of excited state processes. Herein, a novel [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) NC, shielded by alkynyl and exhibiting DE, was synthesized. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to Cu4, for the first time, to investigate the mechanism of DE. With increasing pressure, the higher&#8208;energy emission peak of Cu4 gradually disappeared, leaving the lower&#8208;energy emission peak as the dominant emission. Additionally, the Cu4 crystal exhibited notable piezochromism transitioning from cyan to orange. Angle&#8208;dispersive synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction results revealed that the reduced inter&#8208;cluster distances under pressure brought the peripheral ligands closer, leading to the formation of new C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds in Cu4. It is proposed that these strengthened hydrogen bond interactions limit the ligands&#8242; vibration, resulting in the vanishing of the higher&#8208;energy peak. In situ high&#8208;pressure Raman and vibrationally resolved emission spectra demonstrated that the benzene ring C=C stretching vibration is the structural source of the DE in Cu4.

         <title>Understanding Spin&#8208;Triplet Excited States in Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides (CMAs) are emerging delayed fluorescence emitters with unusual photophysics and open questions involving the nature and population of non&#8208;emissive triplets. We have combined time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations to establish a direct experimental handle for characterizing populated spin&#8208;triplet excitations in benchmark coinage metal CMAs through excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) signatures. Polarity&#8208;induced population/ESA shifts match well between experiments and calculations.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amides (CMAs) are emerging delayed fluorescence materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications. CMAs possess fast, efficient emission owing to rapid forward and reverse intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The resulting dynamic equilibrium between singlet and triplet spin manifolds distinguishes CMAs from most purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters. However, direct experimental triplet characterization in CMAs is underutilized, limiting our detailed understanding of the ISC mechanism. In this work, we combine time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy with tuning of state energies through environmental polarity and metal substitution, focusing on the interplay between charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) and local exciton (3LE) triplets. Unlike previous photophysical work, we investigate evaporated host&#8201;:&#8201;guest films of CMAs and small&#8208;molecule hosts for increased device relevance. Transient absorption reveals an evolution in the triplet excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) consistent with a change in orbital character between hosts with differing dielectric constants. Using quantum chemical calculations, we simulate ESAs of the lowest triplet states, highlighting the contribution of only 3CT and donor&#8208;moiety 3LE states to spectral features, with no strong evidence for a low&#8208;lying acceptor&#8208;centered 3LE. Thus, our work provides a blueprint for understanding the role of triplet excited states in CMAs which will enable further intelligent optimization of this promising class of materials.

         <title>Deep Red Light Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Heterojunction Polymer Dots for Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact heterojunction polymer dots act as a remarkable H2&#8208;production system in response to deep red light illumination. Hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) at the inflammatory tissues were selectively scavenged by H2, therefore accelerating the healing process of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
We describe small heterojunction polymer dots (Pdots) with deep&#8208;red light catalyzed H2 generation for diabetic skin wound healing. The Pdots with donor/acceptor heterojunctions showed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the donor or acceptor nanoparticles alone. We encapsulate the Pdots and ascorbic acid into liposomes to form Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors, which selectively scavenge &#8901;OH radicals in live cells and tissues under 650&#8197;nm light illumination. The antioxidant capacity of the heterojunction Pdots is ~10&#8197;times higher than that of the single&#8208;component Pdots described previously. Under a total light dose of 360&#8197;J/cm2, the Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors effectively scavenged &#8901;OH radicals and suppressed the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in skin tissues, thereby accelerating the healing of skin wounds in diabetic mice. This study provides a feasible solution for safe and effective treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

         <title>Unnatural Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Enabled by Living Cell&#8208;Cell Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seamless connection between different bacterial species was achieved by living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry, enabling the establishment of an unnatural C&#8208;type cytochrome based direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway. The process resulted in an unprecedented interspecies electron transfer pathway shift for highly efficient interspecies electron exchange and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration, understanding, and engineering.







Abstract
Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is essential for maintaining the function and stability of anaerobic microbial consortia. However, only limited natural DIET modes have been identified and DIET engineering remains highly challenging. In this study, an unnatural DIET between Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 (SO, electron donating partner) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RP, electron accepting partner) was artificially established by a facile living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry strategy. By introducing alkyne&#8208; or azide&#8208;modified monosaccharides onto the cell outer surface of the target species, precise covalent connections between different species in high proximity were realized through a fast click chemistry reaction. Remarkably, upon covalent connection, outer cell surface C&#8208;type cytochromes mediated DIET between SO and RP was achieved and identified, although this was never realized naturally. Moreover, this connection directly shifted the natural H2 mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) to DIET between SO and RP, which delivered superior interspecies electron exchange efficiency. Therefore, this work demonstrated a naturally unachievable DIET and an unprecedented MIET shift to DIET accomplished by cell&#8208;cell distance engineering, offering an efficient and versatile solution for DIET engineering, which extends our understanding of DIET and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration and applications.

         <title>N2 Functionalization via Molybdenum&#8208;Nitride Complex: Stepwise BH Bond Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of the Mo&#8801;N bond of a [(PPP)Mo(N)I] complex, which is obtained by N2 splitting, reveals guiding principles to N2 splitting and functionalization to give amine derivatives. The reaction of the N at a Mo center with BH bonds depends on the R2BH reagent.







Abstract
Reactivity of (triphosphine)MoIV&#8208;nitrido complex generated by N2 splitting, toward boranes is reported. The simple adduct Mo&#8801;N&#8594;BH3 is observed with BH3.SMe2 while 1,2 addition is evidenced with 9&#8208;BBN leading to H&#8722;Mo=NBR2. A second addition of BH3.SMe2 is facile and forms an unprecedented complex featuring two bridging H between two B and the Mo centers. Addition of PMe3 or BH3.SMe2 promotes reductive elimination and N&#8722;H bond formation. The full sequence of functionalization at Mo&#8801;N obtained after N2 splitting is therefore evidenced in this work.

         <title>Tailoring Electric Double Layer by Cation Specific Adsorption for High&#8208;Voltage Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively&#8208;charged polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is constructed by the preferential adsorption of 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations on high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process.







Abstract
The interfacial instability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxides severely plagues practical application of high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a uniform and highly oxidation&#8208;resistant polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is engineered by in situ polymerizing 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations preferentially adsorbed on LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM83) surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the copolymerization of [VEIM][BF4] and vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC) endows P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer with the positively&#8208;charged imidazolium moieties, providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process. Consequently, the Li||NCM83 cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V exhibit excellent reversible capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C and considerable discharge capacity of 134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 without capacity decay after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides deep understanding on tailoring electric double layer by cation specific adsorption for high&#8208;voltage quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Novel Photocatalyst Based on Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Induced Intersystem Crossing Enables Rapid and Efficient Polymerization Under Low&#8208;Power Excitation Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the novel strategy of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC), a photocatalyst (NI&#8208;1) with the properties of satisfactory ISC efficiency, long triplet lifetime and robust excited state reduction ability was obtained. This photocatalyst was used in polymerization/ lithography, an efficient and fast polymerization was achieved under the conditions of low power excitation and without electron donor.







Abstract
Currently, most photoredox catalysis polymerization systems are limited by high excitation power, long polymerization time, or the requirement of electron donors due to the precise design of efficient photocatalysts still poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach: the creation of efficient photocatalysts having low ground state oxidation potentials and high excited state energy levels, along with through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC) properties. A cabazole&#8208;naphthalimide (NI) dyad (NI&#8208;1) characterized by long triplet excited state lifetime (&#964;T=62&#8197;&#956;s), satisfactory ISC efficiency (&#934;&#916;=54.3&#8201;%) and powerful reduction capacity [Singlet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;1.93&#8197;eV, Triplet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;0.84&#8197;eV] was obtained. An efficient and rapid polymerization (83&#8201;% conversion of 1&#8197;mM monomer in 30&#8197;s) was observed under the conditions of without electron donor, low excitation power (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low catalyst (NI&#8208;1) loading (&lt;50&#8197;&#956;M). In contrast, the conversion rate was lower at 29&#8201;% when the reference catalyst (NI&#8208;4) was used for photopolymerization under the same conditions, demonstrating the advantage of the TSCT photocatalyst. Finally, the TSCT material was used as a photocatalyst in practical lithography for the first time, achieving pattern resolutions of up to 10&#8197;&#956;m.

         <title>Synthetic Sialosides Terminated with 8&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted Sialic Acid as Selective Substrates for Sialidases from Bacteria and Influenza Viruses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing challenging C8&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;containing sialosides have been developed. High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies demonstrate that C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, bacteria, and influenza A and B viruses. The sialosides can be potentially used for diagnostic detection of sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.







Abstract
Sialosides containing C8&#8208;modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid&#8208;interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing para&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;tagged &#945;2&#8211;3&#8208; and &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;linked sialyl galactosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido, C8&#8208;azido, or C8&#8208;amino derivatized N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8&#8208;azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8&#8208;amino&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8&#8208;amino or C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease&#8208;causing sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Twisting&#8208;Induced Helical Structures from Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Based Fibers Containing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>

We present a combination of wet spinning and twisting technique to continuously yield a novel circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) fibers, which can enable merging phosphorescence, handedness, robustness, flexibility, and knittability in a single system.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered significant attention owing to its distinctive optical characteristics and broad range of potential applications. However, the challenge remains in producing RTP materials with more simplicity, versatility, and practicality on a large scale, particularly in achieving chiral signals within a single system. Herein, we show that a straightforward and effective combination of wet spinning and twisting technique enables continuously fabricating RTP fibers with twisting&#8208;induced helical chirality. By leveraging the hydrogen bonding interactions between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and quinoline derivatives, along with the rigid microenvironment provided by PVA chains, typically, Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber demonstrates outstanding phosphorescent characteristics with RTP lifetime of 1.08&#8197;s and phosphorescence quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;%, and the improved tensile strength being 1.7 times than pure PVA fiber (172&#177;5.82 vs 100&#177;5.65&#8197;MPa). Impressively, the transformation from RTP to circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) is readily achieved by imparting left&#8208; or right&#8208;hand helical structure through simply twisting, enabling large&#8208;scale production of chiral Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber with dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;2. Besides, an array of displays and encryption patterns are crafted by weaving or seaming to exemplify the promising applications of these PVA&#8208;based fibers with outstanding adaptivity in cutting&#8208;edge anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Insights into E.&#8197;coli Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Synthase (CFAS) Towards Enantioselective Carbene Free Biocatalytic Cyclopropanation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as catalytic activity of the E. coli CFAS enzyme are disclosed. The selectivity of ecCFAS in the cyclopropanation of various phospholipids and the influence of vesicle formation on the catalytic activity have been reported. Mutagenesis and in silico experiments have been carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis. The biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate was accomplished with ecCFAS and catalytic SAM cofactor.







Abstract
Cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (CFAS) are a class of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase enzymes able to catalyse the cyclopropanation of unsaturated phospholipids. Since CFAS enzymes employ SAM as a methylene source to cyclopropanate alkene substrates, they have the potential to be mild and more sustainable biocatalysts for cyclopropanation transformations than current carbene&#8208;based approaches. This work describes the characterisation of E.&#8197;coli CFAS (ecCFAS) and its exploitation in the stereoselective biocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropyl lipids. ecCFAS was found to convert phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to methyl dihydrosterculate 1 with up to 58&#8201;% conversion and 73&#8201;% ee and the absolute configuration (9S,10R) was established. Substrate tolerance of ecCFAS was found to be correlated with the electronic properties of phospholipid headgroups and for the first time ecCFAS was found to catalyse cyclopropanation of both phospholipid chains to form dicyclopropanated products. In addition, mutagenesis and in silico experiments were carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis and to provide structural insights into the lipid substrate preference of ecCFAS. Finally, the biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate 1 and its deuterated analogue was also accomplished combining recombinant ecCFAS with the SAM regenerating AtHMT enzyme in the presence of CH3I and CD3I respectively.

         <title>Giant ab&#8208;Plane Birefringence in Quasi&#8208;1D Fibrous Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Kramers&#8208;Kronig analysis was employed to determine the complex refractive index of fibrous red phosphorus, revealing a notable birefringence of 0.642@475&#8197;nm. This remarkable performance can be ascribed to the large electronic dipole polarizability inherent in phosphorus, alongside the anisotropic distribution of electron density and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pairs (SCALP) induced by the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional structure.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals crystal fibrous red phosphorus (RP) exhibits pronounced in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy, positioning it as a potential candidate for polarization&#8208;related micro&#8208;nano devices. Unfortunately, a comprehensive investigation into the complex refractive index of fibrous RP and the structure&#8211;activity relationship connecting the distinctive quasi&#8208;1D structure with optical anisotropy is currently deficient. Herein, we have collectively determined the complex refractive index of the fibrous RP flakes within the ab&#8208;plane through Kramers&#8211;Kronig (KK) analysis and theoretical calculation. Notably, the maximum birefringence of fibrous RP reaches 0.642@475&#8197;nm with an absolute extinction coefficient of only 0.08, superior to the reported traditional optical crystals and the emerging low&#8208;dimensional materials as well. The remarkable birefringence can be attributed to the synergistic influence of the large electronic dipole polarizability, anisotropic electron density distribution and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP). This work demonstrates the potential of fibrous RP for polarization&#8208;sensitive devices, illuminating possibilities to exploit novel giant birefringent crystals based on the structure&#8211;activity relationship.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) van der Waals crystal fibrous red phosphorus (RP) exhibits pronounced in-plane optical anisotropy, positioning it as a potential candidate for polarization-related micro-nano devices.

         <title>Converting Carbon Dioxide into Carbon Nanotubes by Reacting with Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed to produce carbon nanotubes from CO2 and C2H6 at 750&#8201;&#176;C, utilizing earth&#8208;abundant transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) as catalysts. The process simultaneously generates syngas as byproducts. The morphology of the carbon nanotube depends on the type of catalysts.







Abstract
The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO2 emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO2 reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO2 and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth&#8208;abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750&#8201;&#176;C. This route facilitates long&#8208;term carbon storage via generating high&#8208;value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H2/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO2, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO2 not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30&#8201;% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO2 challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts produce CNT with a 20&#8197;nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe&#8208;based catalysts yield bamboo&#8208;like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO2 and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Solid&#8208;State Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;like capabilities of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are exhibited through a thermal response. They arise from the unique rigidity of composite building units (CBUs). The resulting flexible ZIF mechanics resemble the slider&#8208;crank mechanism, they are regulated by chemical functionality and give rise to anisotropic mechanical properties.







Abstract
Machines have continually developed with the needs of daily life and industrial applications. While the careful design of molecular&#8208;scale devices often displays enhanced properties along with mechanical movements, controlling mechanics within solid&#8208;state molecular structures remains a significant challenge. Here, we explore the distinct mechanical properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)&#8212;frameworks that contain hidden mechanical components. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we uncover the machine&#8208;like capabilities of ZIFs, wherein connected composite building units operate similarly to a mechanical linkage system. Importantly, this research suggests that certain ZIF subunits act as core mechanical components, paving an innovative view for the future design of solid&#8208;state molecular machines.

         <title>Size and Polarizability of Boron Cluster Carriers Modulate Chaotropic Membrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic closo&#8208;borates have been systematically studied to identify the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos through lipid bilayers and living cells. By modifying the size of the cluster core and the halogen substituent, we found that the polarizability, a factor that determines their chaotropicity, may serve as a predictor of their transport activity and cytotoxicity for the rational design of permeable drugs







Abstract
Perhalogenated closo&#8208;borates represent a new class of membrane carriers. They owe this activity to their chaotropicity, which enables the transport of hydrophilic molecules across model membranes and into living cells. The transport efficiency of this new class of cluster carriers depends on a careful balance between their affinity to membranes and cargo, which varies with chaotropicity. However, the structure&#8211;activity parameters that define chaotropic transport remain to be elucidated. Here, we have studied the modulation of chaotropic transport by decoupling the halogen composition from the boron core size. The binding affinity between perhalogenated decaborate and dodecaborate clusters carriers was quantified with different hydrophilic model cargos, namely a neutral and a cationic peptide, phalloidin and (KLAKLAK)2. The transport efficiency, membrane&#8208;lytic properties, and cellular toxicity, as obtained from different vesicle and cell assays, increased with the size and polarizability of the clusters. These results validate the chaotropic effect as the driving force behind the membrane transport propensity of boron clusters. This work advances our understanding of the structural features of boron cluster carriers and establishes the first set of rational design principles for chaotropic membrane transporters.

         <title>Stabilizing Few&#8208;Atom Platinum Clusters by Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Glue for Efficient Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step strategy for the efficient and accurate synthesis of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters by predeposition of Zn1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue on MgO supports (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO). The Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO catalyst exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and a high activity with a TOF of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs.







Abstract
Few&#8208;atom metal clusters (FAMCs) exhibit superior performance in catalyzing complex molecular transformations due to their special spatial environments and electronic states, compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, achieving the efficient and accurate synthesis of FAMCs while avoiding the formation of other species, such as nanoparticles and SACs, still remains challenges. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy for synthesis of few&#8208;atom platinum (Pt) clusters by predeposition of zinc single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue (Zn1) on MgO nanosheets (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO), where FAMCs can be obtained over a wide range of Pt contents (0.09 to 1.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Zn atoms can act as Lewis acidic sites to allow electron transfer between Zn and Pt through bridging O atoms, which play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters. Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation. Moreover, an excellent activity with a turnover frequency of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs. Further theoretical studies revealed that the Pt atoms in Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO possess moderate steric hindrance, which enables high selectivity and activity for hydrosilylation. This work presents some guidelines for utilizing atomic&#8208;scale species to increase the synthesis efficiency and precision of FAMCs.

A cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modifications of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The twin&#8208;cage has four binding sites, which show site discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The copper(I) guest inside the tri&#8208;imine cage is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of bright emissive precursor clusters triggered by H2O2 solution.

A gold(I)&#8208;cluster&#8208;based twin&#8208;cage has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modification of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has double cavities and four binding sites, which show site&#8208;discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The guests in the tripodal hats affect the luminescence of the cluster: the tetra&#8208;silver(I) host&#8211;guest complex is weakly red&#8208;emissive, while the bis&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;bis&#8208;silver(I) one is non&#8208;emissive but is a stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecule. The copper(I) ion inside the tri&#8208;imine cavity is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of the bright emissive precursor cluster triggered by H2O2 solution. The hybridization of a cluster with cavities to construct a cluster&#8208;based cage presents an innovative concept for functional cluster design, and the post&#8208;clustering covalent modification opens up new avenues for finely tuning the properties of clusters.

         <title>Aggregation Enhanced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence through Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented a novel approach focused on modifying the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process by influencing dynamic processes in excited states through the aggregation effect. The results demonstrated that restricting molecular rotation and vibration is beneficial for enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST).







Abstract
Integrating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters holds great promise for the advancement of highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Despite recent advancements, a thorough comprehension of the underlying mechanisms remains imperative for the practical application of such materials. In this work, we introduce a novel approach aimed at modulating the TADF process by manipulating dynamic processes in excited states through aggregation effect. Our findings reveal that aggregation not only enhances both prompt and delayed fluorescence simultaneously but also imposes constraints on molecular reorientation. This constraint reinforces spin&#8208;orbit coupling and reduces the energy gap between singlets and triplets. These insights deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the aggregation effect on TADF materials and provide valuable guidance for the design of high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescent materials.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization: A Facile Strategy toward Functional Poly(Vinylpyridinium Salt)s with Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Killing Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization was successfully established, resulting in a series of poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weight and well&#8208;defined structure. The resulting polymers exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent luminescent properties, and most importantly, demonstrate excellent broad&#8208;spectrum bactericidal efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
Polymeric materials with antibacterial properties hold great promise for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. However, the synthesis of most antibacterial polymers typically involves complicated and time&#8208;consuming procedures. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy for synthesizing functional poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s via pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization. This click polymerization could proceed with high atom economy under mild conditions without any external catalyst, yielding soluble and thermally stable poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weights and well&#8208;defined structures in excellent yields. Additionally, the incorporation of luminescent units such as fluorene, tetraphenylethylene, and triphenylamine into the polymer backbone confers excellent aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties upon the resulting polymers, rendering them suitable for bacterial staining. Moreover, the existence of pyridinium salt imparts intrinsic antibacterial activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria to the polymers, enabling them to effectively inhibit wound bacterial infection and significantly expedite the healing process. This work not only provides an efficient method to prepare antibacterial polymers, but also opens up the possibility of various applications of polymers in healthcare and other antibacterial fields.

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanistic Role of Chiral Palladacycles in Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of carboxylic acids, the key palladacycles were isolated and characterized. Intermediate chemistry and stoichiometric transformation studies of the chiral palladacycles revealed that the C&#8722;H palladation step is irreversible and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining, and the functionalization step is ligand&#8208;independent.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions has attracted considerable attention due to its ability for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched molecules and stimulation of novel retrosynthetic disconnections. Understanding the reaction mechanism, especially the stereochemical process of the reaction, is crucial for the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems. Previously, we developed a Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalytic system for asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions. In this study, we focused on unraveling the chemistry of chiral palladacycles involved in the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. We have isolated key palladacycle intermediates involved in the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of carboxylic acids catalyzed by the Pd(II)/SOHP system. These palladacycles, exhibiting ligand&#8208;induced chirality, provided a significant opportunity to investigate the stereochemical process and the ligand effect in this asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization. Our investigation provided direct evidence for the C&#8722;H palladation step as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, which forms diastereomeric palladacycles that exhibited preservation of chirality in the functionalization step. DFT calculations provided insights into the chiral induction in palladacycle formation. This work highlights the value of chiral palladacycle chemistry in offering mechanistic insights into the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions.

         <title>Nonflammable Phosphate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Potassium Batteries Enabled by Optimized Solvation Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The safety and lifespan of energy storage devices have always been a challenge for the development of batteries, and potassium&#8208;ion batteries are no exception. In this work, we present an advanced non&#8208;flammable electrolyte achieved by carefully manipulating the solvation capability of a family of phosphate solvents. The customized electrolyte enables safe and stable cycling of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Current potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are limited in safety and lifetime owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. To address these issues, herein, we report an innovative non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design strategy that leverages an optimal moderate solvation phosphate&#8208;based solvent which strikes a balance between solvation capability and salt dissociation ability, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The formulated electrolyte simultaneously exhibits the advantages of low salt concentration (only 0.6&#8197;M), low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high oxidative stability, and safety. Our electrolyte also promotes the formation of self&#8208;limiting inorganic&#8208;rich interphases at the anode surface, alongside robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase on iron&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues, mitigating electrode/electrolyte side reactions and preventing Fe dissolution. Notably, the PIBs employing our electrolyte exhibit exceptional durability, with 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 2,000&#8197;cycles at high&#8208;voltage of 4.2&#8197;V in a coin cell. Impressively, in a larger scale pouch cell, it maintains over 81&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1,400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C&#8208;rate with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. This work represents a significant advancement toward the realization of safe, sustainable, and high&#8208;performance PIBs.

Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D c&#8208;MOFs, namely PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH&#8208;PA&#8208;TAPA and 8OH&#8208;PA&#8208;PyTTA). Notably, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these 2D c&#8208;MOFs can serve as promising cathode host materials for polyiodides in ADIBs for the first time. The incorporation of triphenylamine moieties in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF resulted in a higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance, retaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF. Our comparative analysis revealed that the increased number of N anchoring sites and larger pore size in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF facilitate efficient anchoring and conversion of I3&#8722;, as supported by spectroscopic electrochemistry and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Constructing Metal(II)&#8208;Sulfate Site Catalysts toward Low Overpotential Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Fuel Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN composite containing highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites, where CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with high selectivity (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%) via a carboxyl intermediate, was prepared. With the enlightenment of this new pathway, more metals might show their potential to convert CO2 under appropriate modulation.







Abstract
Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3&#8201;% at a cell voltage of 2.8&#8197;V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.

         <title>Robust, Efficient, and Recoverable Thermocells with Zwitterion&#8208;Boosted Hydrogel Electrolytes for Energy&#8208;Autonomous and Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy is employed to simultaneously enhance the mechanical properties and thermoelectrochemical performance of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs). This is realized by introducing a zwitterion&#8208;boosted hydrogel electrolyte. The as&#8208;fabricated TECs exhibit substantially improved overall performance, with the capability to repeatedly recover from severe mechanical damages through sol&#8208;gel transformations, demonstrating high potential in energy&#8208;autonomous wearable applications.







Abstract
The rapid growth of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs) provides a fresh way forward for wearable electronics. However, their insufficient mechanical strength and power output still hinder their further applications. This work demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy to synergistically enhance the mechanical and thermoelectrochemical properties of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722;&#8208;based TECs. By introducing Hofmeister effect and multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions via betaine zwitterions, the mechanical strength of the conventional brittle gelatin hydrogel electrolytes is substantially improved from 50 to 440&#8197;kPa, with a high stretchability approaching 250&#8201;%. Meanwhile, the betaine zwitterions strongly affect the solvation structure of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; ions, thus enlarging the entropy difference and raising the thermoelectrochemical Seebeck coefficient from 1.47 to 2.2&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1. The resultant quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state TECs exhibit a normalized output power density of 0.48&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, showing a notable improvement in overall performance compared to their counterparts without zwitterion regulation. The intrinsic thermo&#8208;reversible property also allows the TECs to repeatedly self&#8208;recover through sol&#8208;gel transformations, ensuring reliable energy output and even recycling of TECs in case of extreme mechanical damages. An energy&#8208;autonomous smart glove consisting of eighteen individual TECs is further designed, which can simultaneously monitor the temperature of different positions on any touched object, demonstrating high potential in wearable applications.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.







Abstract
Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization.

&lt;p&gt;The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring-opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene-salen aluminium (SalBinam-Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring-opening polymerization. This binaphthalene-salen aluminium (SalBinam-Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-&#945;-substituted-&#946;-propiothiolactones (&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BTL and &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-benzyl-3-mercapto-propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins.

         <title>Purely Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Molecule for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;Doped Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;doped OLEDs with conventional complex configurations containing thin emitting layers and simplified configurations featuring thick emitting layers as well as non&#8208;doped tandem and top&#8208;emitting OLEDs are achieved based on a tailor&#8208;made purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) molecule, providing the best electrophosphorescence efficiencies with ultrasmall efficiency roll&#8208;offs ever reported for RTP molecules.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are potential luminescent materials with high exciton utilization for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but those exhibiting superb electroluminescence (EL) performances are rarely explored, mainly due to their long phosphorescence lifetimes. Herein, a robust purely organic RTP molecule, 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenylindolo[3,2&#8208;a]carbazol&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;xanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT), is developed. The neat film of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT shows strong green RTP with a very short lifetime (2.9&#8197;&#956;s) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (72&#8201;%), and behaviors balanced bipolar charge transport. The RTP nature of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT is validated by steady&#8208;state and transient absorption and emission spectroscopies, and the working mechanism is deciphered by theoretical simulation. Non&#8208;doped multilayer OLEDs using thin neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT furnish an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.91&#8201;% with an extremely low roll&#8208;off (1.6&#8201;%) at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. High&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped top&#8208;emitting and tandem OLEDs are also achieved, providing remarkable EQEs of 24.53&#8201;% and 42.50&#8201;%, respectively. Delightfully, non&#8208;doped simplified OLEDs employing thick neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT are also realized, furnishing an excellent EQE of 17.79&#8201;% and greatly enhanced operational lifetime. The temperature&#8208;dependent and transient EL spectroscopies demonstrate the electrophosphorescence attribute of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT. These non&#8208;doped OLEDs are the best devices based on purely organic RTP materials reported so far.

         <title>Ultralow Catalytic Loading for Optimised Electrocatalytic Performance of AuPt Nanoparticles to Produce Hydrogen and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antenna&#8208;reactor nanoparticles (NPs) are at the forefront of plasmonic catalysis. This work demonstrates that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component in gold&#8208;platinum (AuPt) NPs unlock superior catalytic activity and controlled selectivity for hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions under visible&#8208;light excitation. This finding paves the way for designing highly efficient plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions are key to producing green hydrogen and ammonia. Antenna&#8211;reactor nanoparticles hold promise to improve the performances of these transformations under visible&#8208;light excitation, by combining plasmonic and catalytic materials. However, current materials involve compromising either on the catalytic activity or the plasmonic enhancement and also lack control of reaction selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component optimize catalytic activity and selectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Taking Pt&#8722;Au as an example we find that fine&#8208;tuning the Pt content produces a 6&#8208;fold increase in the hydrogen evolution compared to commercial Pt/C as well as a 6.5&#8208;fold increase in the nitrite reduction and a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in the selectivity for producing ammonia under visible light excitation relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory suggests that the catalytic reactions are accelerated by the intimate contact between nanoscale Pt&#8208;rich and Au&#8208;rich regions at the surface, which facilitates the formation of electron&#8208;rich hot&#8208;carrier puddles associated with the Pt&#8208;based active sites. The results provide exciting opportunities to design new materials with improved photocatalytic performance for sustainable energy applications.

Two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, were produced and characterized. Further studies suggested that benefiting from boosted electron push&#8208;pull interactions, thereby facilitating charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Despite the pivotal role of molecular oxygen (O2) activation in artificial photosynthesis, the activation efficiency is often restricted by sluggish exciton dissociation and charge transfer kinetics within polymer photocatalysts. Herein, we propose two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, to promote O2 activation. Because of enhanced electron push&#8208;pull interactions that facilitated charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions over TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF under visible light irradiation, including the photosynthesis of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;thiocyano&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds and H2O2. These findings highlight the significant potential of the rational design of COFs with D&#8211;A configurations as suitable candidates for advanced photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Helically Chiral &#960;&#8208;Expanded Azocines Through Regioselective Beckmann Rearrangement and Their Charged States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allowed for convenient synthesis of negatively curved &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes with integrated azocine units. The helical compounds display high configurational stability and distinct homoenantiomeric &#960;&#8208; &#960; stacking in the solid state.

We report a synthetic approach to &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes incorporating tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5&#8208;membered ring, which exhibit intriguing structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8&#8208;membered lactam, azocine, and amine units. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, with distinct packing motifs in the solid state. The compounds exhibit promising optoelectronic properties with considerable photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission wavelengths depending on the relative position of the nitrogen center within the polycyclic framework. Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#8197;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.

         <title>Stabilizing Zn/electrolyte Interphasial Chemistry by a Sustained&#8208;Release Drug Inspired Indium&#8208;Chelated Resin Protective Layer for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Zn//V2O5 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer is designed to stabilize the Zn/electrolyte interphasial region. The sustained release of In3+ can provide continuous heterogeneous nucleation sites for Zn deposition and alleviate HER side reactions, meanwhile the anchored resin matrix layer can repel detrimental anions like SO42&#8722; and V10O26(OH)24&#8722;, circumventing serious dendrite growth.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;metal batteries, the instable chemistry at Zn/electrolyte interphasial region results in severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, significantly impairing Zn anode reversibility. Moreover, an often&#8208;overlooked aspect is this instability can be further exacerbated by the interaction with dissolved cathode species in full batteries. Here, inspired by sustained&#8208;release drug technology, an indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer (Chelex&#8208;In), incorporating a sustained&#8208;release mechanism for indium, is developed on Zn surface, stabilizing the anode/electrolyte interphase to ensure reversible Zn plating/stripping performance throughout the entire lifespan of Zn//V2O5 batteries. The sustained&#8208;release indium onto Zn electrode promotes a persistent anticatalytic effect against HER and fosters uniform heterogeneous Zn nucleation. Meanwhile, on the electrolyte side, the residual resin matrix with immobilized iminodiacetates anions can also repel detrimental anions (SO42&#8722; and polyoxovanadate ions dissolved from V2O5 cathode) outside the electric double layer. This dual synergetic regulation on both electrode and electrolyte sides culminates a more stable interphasial environment, effectively enhancing Zn anode reversibility in practical high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity full battery systems. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired Chelex&#8208;In protective layer enables an ultralong lifespan of Zn anode over 2800&#8197;h, which is also successfully demonstrated in ultrahigh areal capacity Zn//V2O5 full batteries (4.79&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Achieving a Deeply Desodiated Stabilized Cathode Material by the High Entropy Strategy for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy strategy is applied to design a new P2 phase cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to improve stability in deeply desodiated states. This material exhibits superior reversibility with 0.61 Na extracted, attributed to triggered lattice&#8208;oxygen redox reaction activity and facilitated Na+ migration. As a result, it demonstrates excellent initial Coulombic efficiency, high energy density, and lengthened cycling performance.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based layered oxides are currently of significant interest as cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low toxicity and high specific capacity. However, the practical applications are impeded by sluggish intrinsic Na+ migration and poor structure stability as a result of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and complicated phase transition. In this study, a high&#8208;entropy strategy is proposed to enhance the high&#8208;voltage capacity and cycling stability. The designed P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.08Ni0.09Fe0.18Ti0.05O2 achieves a deeply desodiation and delivers charging capacity of 158.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to 0.61 Na with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.2&#8201;%. The charge compensation is attributed to the cationic and anionic redox reactions conjunctively. Moreover, the crystal structure is effectively stabilized, leading to a slight variation of lattice parameters. This research carries implications for the expedited development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>[2+1] Cycloadditions Modulate the Hydrophobicity of Ni&#8208;N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2+1] Cycloaddition of difluorocarbene onto N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Ni&#8208;N4 catalysts is successfully realized, leading to the covalent attachment of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups on the catalyst. The microenvironment of Ni&#8208;N4 sites is changed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic after installing &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups, which inhibits hydrogen evolution and thus favors CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Microenvironment regulation of M&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a promising way to tune their catalytic properties toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. However, strategies that can effectively introduce functional groups around the M&#8208;N4 sites through strong covalent bonding and under mild reaction conditions are highly desired. Taking the hydrophilic Ni&#8208;N4 SAC as a representative, we report herein a [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between Ni&#8208;N4 and in situ generated difluorocarbene (F2C:), and enable the surface fluorocarbonation of Ni&#8208;N4, resulting in the formation of a super&#8208;hydrophobic Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the mild reaction conditions allow Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 to inherit both the electronic and structural configuration of the Ni&#8208;N4 sites from Ni&#8208;N4. Enhanced electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Faradaic efficiency above 98&#8201;% is achieved in a wide operating potential window from &#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V over Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that a highly hydrophobic microenvironment formed by the &#8722;CF2&#8722; group repels asymmetric H&#8208;bonded water at the electrified interface, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction and promoting CO production. This work highlights the advantages of [2+1] cycloaddition reactions on the covalent modification of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts.

         <title>Stereoselective Entry into &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Oxepane Scaffolds through a Chalcogen Bonding Catalyzed Strain&#8208;Release C&#8208;Septanosylation Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
By exploiting chalcogen bonding catalysis, a rare thermodynamically favored strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation approach was developed to access the biologically relevant &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane scaffold. Besides tolerating a broad selection of substrates, this strategy taps upon an unknown steric guided intramolecular aglycone transposition pathway via a pentavalent silicon intermediate to achieve the excellent stereoselectivity outcome.







Abstract
The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively. Herein, we disclose the versatility of a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst to facilitate access into the challenging, but biologically interesting 7&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane core through an &#945;&#8208;selective strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation. Methodically, this strategy represents a switch from more common but entropically less desired macrocyclizations to a thermodynamically favored ring&#8208;expansion approach. In light of the general lack of stereoselective methods to access C&#8208;septanosides, a remarkable palette of silyl&#8208;based nucleophiles can be reliably employed in our method. This include a broad variety of useful synthons, such as easily available silyl&#8208;allyl, silyl&#8208;enol ether, silyl&#8208;ketene acetal, vinylogous silyl&#8208;ketene acetal, silyl&#8208;alkyne and silylazide reagents. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a mechanistic shift towards an intramolecular aglycone transposition involving a pentacoordinate silicon intermediate is likely responsible in steering the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Design of Solid Polycationic Electrolyte to Enable Durable Chloride&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion battery based on a low&#8208;cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.







Abstract
The high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) make them promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of CIBs is greatly restricted by the lack of compatible electrolytes to support cost&#8208;effective anodes. Herein, we present a rationally designed solid polycationic electrolyte (SPE) to enable room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion batteries utilizing aluminum (Al) metal as an anode. This SPE endows the CIB configuration with improved air stability and safety (i.e. free of flammability and liquid leakage). A high ionic conductivity (1.3&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been achieved by the well&#8208;tailored coordination structure of the SPE. Meanwhile, the solid polycationic electrolyte ensures stable electrodes|electrolyte interfaces, which effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on the Al anodes and degradation of the FeOCl cathodes. The Al|SPE|FeOCl chloride&#8208;ion batteries showcased a high discharge capacity around 250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (based on the cathodes) and extended lifespan. Our electrolyte design opens a new avenue for developing low&#8208;cost chloride&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regulating Spin Density using TEMPOL Molecules for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion by HKUST&#8208;1 Framework Derived Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin density of active Cu sites is regulated by incorporating nitroxide radicals (TEMPOL) in HKUST&#8208;1 frameworks. The formation of localized spin&#8208;ordered phase in the pristine spin&#8208;disordered phase allows for the asymmetric spin configuration on Cu&#8722;Cu sites in TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1. Therefore, its derived electrocatalyst shows a two&#8208;fold spin&#8208;enhanced ethylene selectivity in CO2 reduction compared to HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
The selectivity of multicarbon products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the spin alignment of neighboring active sites, which requires a spin catalyst that facilitates electron transfer with antiparallel spins for enhanced C&#8722;C coupling. Here, we design a radical&#8208;contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1) to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion, in which spin&#8208;disordered (SDO) and spin&#8208;ordered (SO) phases co&#8208;exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin&#8208;spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O&#8208;mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at &#8722;1.8&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST&#8208;1. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50&#8201;%. The exploration of the spin&#8208;polarized kinetics of the CO2RR provides a promising path for the development of novel spin electrocatalysts with superior performance.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Approach to the Enantioselective Construction of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Alcohols by Radical Epoxide Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate an operationally simple approach towards &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in good to excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios in two steps from diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our method relies on an unprecedented, radical, intramolecular syn&#8208;allyl transfer to intermediate &#946;&#8208;titanoxy radicals resulting from an Cp2TiIIIallyl&#8208;induced fragmentation of epoxide precursors.







Abstract
We describe a highly stereoconvergent radical epoxide allylation towards diastereomerically and enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in two steps from olefins. Our approach combines the stereospecifity and enantioselectivity of the Shi epoxidation with the unprecedented Ti(III)&#8208;promoted intramolecular radical group transfer allylation of epoxides. A directional isomerization step via configurationally labile radical intermediates enables the selective preparation of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in a unique fashion.

         <title>Carbon Free Radical (R&#8901;) Inactivates NF&#8208;&#954;B for Radical Capping Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical capping strategy is proposed by assembling carbon radical (R&#8901;) precursors loaded nanomicelles. R&#8901; is found to mediate electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in DNA, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction, resulting in a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and tumor metastasis inhibition. This mechanism is promising in macromolecules modification and radical mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Radical capping strategy is proposed by assembling carbon radical (R&#8901;) precursors loaded nanomicelles. R&#8901; is found to mediate electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in DNA, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF-&#954;B through radical chain reaction, resulting in a remarkable NF-&#954;B inactivation and tumor metastasis inhibition. This mechanism is promising in macromolecules modification and radical mediated cancer therapy.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ Evolved Ligand Defects</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and confined H2O into pure syngas with controllable wide H2/CO ratios is presented. The ligand defect&#8208;induced in situ dynamic structure evolution of porous MOF catalyst favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics and the resultantly reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.

         <title>Intrarenal pH&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Diagnosis of Early Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly were developed for highly sensitive and long&#8208;term imaging of different stages of metabolic acidosis induced kidney injury.







Abstract
Metabolic acidosis&#8208;induced kidney injury (MAKI) is asymptomatic and lack of clinical biomarkers in early stage, but rapidly progresses to severe renal fibrosis and ultimately results in end&#8208;stage kidney failure. Therefore, developing rapid and noninvasive strategies direct responsive to renal tubular acidic microenvironment rather than delayed biomarkers are essential for timely renoprotective interventions. Herein, we develop pH&#8208;responsive luminescent gold nanoparticles (p&#8208;AuNPs) in the second near&#8208;infrared emission co&#8208;coated with 2,3&#8208;dimethylaleic anhydride conjugated &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethylamine and cationic 2&#8208;diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride, which showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly for highly sensitive and long&#8208;time (~24&#8197;h) imaging of different stages of MAKI. By integrating advantages of pH&#8208;induced intrarenal self&#8208;assembly and enhanced interactions between pH&#8208;triggered positively charged p&#8208;AuNPs and renal tubular cells, the early&#8208; and late&#8208;stage MAKI could be differentiated rapidly within 10&#8197;min post&#8208;injection (p.i.) with contrast index (CI) of 3.5 and 4.3, respectively. The corresponding maximum CI could reach 5.1 and 9.2 at 12&#8197;h p.i., respectively. Furthermore, p&#8208;AuNPs were demonstrated to effectively real&#8208;time monitor progressive recovery of kidney injury in MAKI mice after therapy, and also exhibit outstanding capabilities for drug screening. This pH&#8208;responsive strategy showed great promise for feedback on kidney dysfunction progression, opening new possibilities for early&#8208;stage diagnosis of pH&#8208;related diseases.

An electrochemical difluoro&#8208; and trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides triggers the 1,4&#8208;migration of the aromatic ring through a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement. This transformation offers a straightforward access to valuable &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives in good yields and under mild reaction conditions from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
An electrochemical radical Truce Smiles rearrangement of N&#8208;allylbenzamides is documented herein. The selective 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was triggered by the radical fluoromethylation of the alkene providing a direct route to fluoro derivatives of the highly privileged &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine pharmacophore. This practical transformation utilizes readily available starting materials and employs an electrical current to drive the oxidative process under mild reaction conditions. It accommodates a variety of migratory aryl groups with different electronic properties and substitution patterns. Careful selection of the protecting group on the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;allylbenzamide is crucial to outcompete the undesired 6&#8208;endo cyclization and achieve high level of selectivity towards the 1,4&#8208;aryl migration. DFT calculations support the reaction mechanism and unveil the origin of selectivity between the two competitive pathways.

         <title>Multivariate Silicification&#8208;Assisted Single Enzyme Structure Augmentation for Improved Enzymatic Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221; is introduced, where inorganic silica precursors are used to balance the flexibility and stability of an enzyme. The integration of the enzyme with an organosilica framework brings advantages including surface microenvironment adjustability, structure augmentation, prolonged stability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility, which have the potential to expand enzyme applications.







Abstract
The ability to finely tune/balance the structure and rigidity of enzymes to realize both high enzymatic activity and long&#8208;term stability is highly desired but highly challenging. Herein, we propose the concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221;, where solid inorganic silica undergoes controlled hybridization with the fragile enzyme under moderate conditions at the single&#8208;enzyme level, thus enabling simultaneous structure augmentation, long&#8208;term stability, and high enzymatic activity preservation. A multivariate silicification approach was utilized and occurred around individual enzymes to allow conformal coating. To realize a high activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off the structure flexibility/rigidity of the silicazyme was optimized by a component adjustment ternary (CAT) plot method. Moreover, the multivariate organosilica frameworks bring great advantages, including surface microenvironment adjustability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility through the rich chemistry of silica. Overall silicazymes represent a new class of enzymes with promise for catalysis, separations, and nanomedicine.

The integration of the enzyme with an organosilica framework brings advantages including surface microenvironment adjustability, structure augmentation, prolonged stability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility, which have the potential to expand enzyme applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to finely tune/balance the structure and rigidity of enzymes to realize both high enzymatic activity and long-term stability is highly desired but highly challenging. Herein, we propose the concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221;, where solid inorganic silica undergoes controlled hybridization with the fragile enzyme under moderate conditions at the single-enzyme level, thus enabling simultaneous structure augmentation, long-term stability, and high enzymatic activity preservation. A multivariate silicification approach was utilized and occurred around individual enzymes to allow conformal coating. To realize a high activity&#8211;stability trade-off the structure flexibility/rigidity of the silicazyme was optimized by a component adjustment ternary (CAT) plot method. Moreover, the multivariate organosilica frameworks bring great advantages, including surface microenvironment adjustability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility through the rich chemistry of silica. Overall silicazymes represent a new class of enzymes with promise for catalysis, separations, and nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanochannels with built&#8208;in electric fields were constructed by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets to manipulate ion transport, achieving a high rejection of salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases and simultaneously ultrafast water transport, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous charge nanochannel membranes.







Abstract
Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.

         <title>Molecularly Tunable Heterostructured Co&#8208;Polymers Containing Electron&#8208;Deficient and &#8208;Rich Moieties for Visible&#8208;Light and Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>

The construction of molecular heterostructures increases the molecular dipole moment and extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the interchain covalent bond (C=C) at its junction provides a channel for rapid electron transfer, leading to improved H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation without sacrificial agent.







Abstract
As an alternative to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by complex anthraquinone oxidation process, photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen without sacrificial agents is highly demanded. Herein, a covalently connected molecular heterostructure is synthesized via sequential C&#8722;H arylation and Knoevenagel polymerization reactions for visible&#8208;light and sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 synthesis. The subsequent copolymerization of the electron&#8208;deficient benzodithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione (BTD) and the electron&#8208;rich biphenyl (B) and p&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (CN) not only expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated domain but also increases the molecular dipole moment, which largely promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers. The optimal heterostructured BTDB&#8208;CN0.2 manifested an impressive photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 1920&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.2 and 11.6&#8197;times that of BTDB and BTDCN. As revealed by the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) and theoretical calculations, the linkage serves as a channel for the rapid transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. Further, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) uncovers that the oxygen reduction reaction occurs through the step one&#8208;electron pathway and the mutual conversion between C=O and C&#8722;OH with the anchoring of H+ during the catalysis favored the formation of H2O2. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of efficient organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Responsive Organic Fluorescent Aggregates Based on Ion&#8208;&#960; Interactions Away from Fluorescent Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules containing the same conjugated groups and different anions (Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;) exhibit completely different fluorescence behaviors under external stimuli. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders.







Abstract
Responsive organic luminescent aggregates have a wide range of application fields, but currently there is still a lack of reasonable molecular design strategies. Introducing ion&#8208;&#960; interactions into molecules can effectively alter their luminescent properties. However, current research typically focuses on ion localization at luminescent conjugated groups with the strong interaction forces. In this work, we introduce the flexible alkoxy chain spacers between fluorescent conjugated groups and ion&#8208;&#960; interaction sites, and then adjust the fluorescence performance of the molecule by changing the strength of ion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules with strong ion&#8208;&#960; interactions exhibit high and stable fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders under the external stimuli. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules with weak ion&#8208;&#960; interactions have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders, showing variable fluorescence intensities under external stimuli. This demonstrates a new class of responsive organic luminescent solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Revealing Hydrogen Bond Effect in Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinone&#8208;based small molecules with progressive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) numbers has been rationally designed to reveal the real effects of H&#8208;bond on the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials (OEMs) in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). The appropriate number of H&#8208;bonds in OEM improves its structure stability and utilization of active sites and reduces the battery polarization, contributing to the construction of high&#8208;performance ZOBs.







Abstract
The surrounding hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) interaction around the active sites plays indispensable functions in enabling the organic electrode materials (OEMs) to fulfill their roles as ion reservoirs in aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Despite important, there are still no works could fully shed its real effects light on. Herein, quinone&#8208;based small molecules with a H&#8208;bond evolution model has been rationally selected to disclose the regulation and equilibration of H&#8208;bond interaction between OEMs, and OEM and the electrolyte. It has been found that only a suitable H&#8208;bond interaction could make the OEMs fully liberate their potential performance. Accordingly, the 2,5&#8208;diaminocyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (DABQ) with elaborately designed H&#8208;bond structure exhibits a capacity of 193.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a record&#8208;high mass loading of 66.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the DABQ//Zn battery also possesses air&#8208;rechargeable ability by utilizing the chemistry redox of proton. Our results put forward a specific pathway to precise utilization of H&#8208;bond to liberate the performance of OEMs.

In addition, the DABQ//Zn battery also possesses air-rechargeable ability by utilizing the chemistry redox of proton. Our results put forward a specific pathway to precise utilization of H-bond to liberate the performance of OEMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Driven by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces alternating current (AC) electrolysis in ATRP using a symmetrical Cu/Cu electrode pair to generate the CuI activator complex and drive the polymerization. Square and sinusoidal waves at 0.1&#8197;Hz from an AC generator were used to polymerize many monomers (including functionals) in organic solvent, water, and bulk. The same electrode pair and the same AC current value were used for all polymerizations and block copolymerizations.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) and pulsed electrolysis are gaining traction in electro(organic) synthesis due to their advantageous characteristics. We employed AC electrolysis in electrochemically mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (eATRP) to facilitate the regeneration of the activator CuI complex on Cu0 electrodes. Additionally, Cu0 served as a slow supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA ATRP), enabling the activation of alkyl halides and the regeneration of the CuI activator through a comproportionation reaction. We harnessed the distinct properties of Cu0 dual regeneration, both chemical and electrochemical, by employing sinusoidal, triangular, and square&#8208;wave AC electrolysis alongside some of the most active ATRP catalysts available. Compared to linear waveform (DC electrolysis) or SARA ATRP (without electrolysis), pulsed and AC electrolysis facilitated slightly faster and more controlled polymerizations of acrylates. The same AC electrolysis conditions could successfully polymerize eleven different monomers across different mediums, from water to bulk. Moreover, it proved effective across a spectrum of catalyst activity, from low&#8208;activity Cu/2,2&#8208;bipyridine to highly active Cu complexes with substituted tripodal amine ligands. Chain extension experiments confirmed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of the produced polymers, yielding functional and high molecular&#8208;weight block copolymers. SEM analysis indicated the robustness of the Cu0 electrodes, sustaining at least 15 consecutive polymerizations.

         <title>Patterned Photonic Actuators with Dynamic Shape&#8208;Morphing and Color&#8208;Changing Capabilities Fabricated by Athermal Embossing Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An athermal embossing technique is introduced for the rapid fabrication of patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. Two demonstration models, one butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator and the other origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator, have been created to validate the synergistic shape&#8208;morphing and color&#8208;changing capabilities of patterned photonic actuators.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive patterned photonic actuators, characterized by their patterned nano/microscale structures and capacity to demonstrate synergistic color changes and shape morphing in response to external stimuli, have attracted intense scientific attention. However, traditional patterned photonic actuator systems still face limitations such as cumbersome and time&#8208;consuming preparation processes and small&#8208;scale deformations. Herein, we introduce a facile approach involving an athermal embossing technique to rapidly fabricate patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. The resulting patterned photonic actuators demonstrate remarkable features, including brilliant angle&#8208;dependent structural color, complex three&#8208;dimensional actuation, and good color durability under NIR light stimulation. As illustrative demonstrations of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate two light&#8208;fuelled patterned photonic soft actuators: a butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator that can produce wing&#8208;flapping dynamic changes in structural color, and an origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator with shape memory, structural color information storage, and dynamic display properties. This strategy provides distinct insights into the design and fabrication of various patterned photonic soft robotic devices and intelligent actuators.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.







Abstract
Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non&#8208;communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system. Herein we report that communication between two different dynamic libraries through an irreversible process is also possible. Indeed, alkyl amines cancel the dynamic regime on the nucleophilic substitution of tetrazines, generating kinetically inert compounds. Interestingly, such amine can be part of another dynamic library, an imine&#8208;amine exchange. Thus, both libraries are interconnected with each other by an irreversible process which leads to kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Additionally, a latent irreversible intercommunication could be developed. In such a way, a stable molecular system with specific host&#8211;guest and fluorescence properties, could be irreversibly transformed when the right stimulus was applied, triggering the cancellation of the original supramolecular and luminescent properties and the emergence of new ones.

         <title>Highly Stable MOF&#8208;Type Lead Halide Luminescent Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis of a series of MOF&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics with exceptional robustness. The strategy emphasizes the importance of high structural integrity in designing the high&#8208;Curie temperature ferroelectrics and the covalent interactions to facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer to achieve long&#8208;lived phosphorescence.







Abstract
Lead halide molecular ferroelectrics represent an important class of luminescent ferroelectrics, distinguished by their high chemical and structural tunability, excellent processability and distinctive luminescent characteristics. However, their inherent instability, prone to decomposition upon exposure to moisture and light, hinders their broader ferroelectric applications. Herein, for the first time, we present a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics, demonstrating exceptional robustness under ambient conditions for at least 15&#8197;months and even when subjected to aqueous boiling conditions. Unlike conventional metal&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) in MOFs adopting highly centrosymmetric structure with limited structural distortion, our lead halide&#8208;based MOFs occupy structurally deformable [Pb2X]+ (X=Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;/I&#8722;) SBUs that facilitate a c&#8208;axis&#8208;biased displacement of Pb2+ centers and substantially contribute to thermoinducible structural transformation. Importantly, this class of MOF&#8208;type lead halide ferroelectrics undergo ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transitions with remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 505&#8197;K, superior to most of molecular ferroelectrics. Moreover, the covalent bonding between phosphorescent organic component and the light&#8208;harvesting inorganic component achieves efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing, resulting in long&#8208;lived afterglow emission. The compelling combination of high stability, ferroelectricity and afterglow emission exhibited by lead halide MOFs opens up many potential opportunities in energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Unlocking the NIR&#8208;II AIEgen for High Brightness through Intramolecular Electrostatic Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkylthio side chain on the thiophene bridge affords sulfur&#8212;nitrogen electrostatic lock, substantially improving the fluorescent brightness of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained NIR&#8208;II AIEgen shows high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging and high sensitivity in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for non&#8208;invasive, radiation&#8208;free, and rapid&#8208;response clinical diagnosis. However, it's still challenging to develop bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6&#8208;fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The in vivo experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio 1.9&#8208;fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfones via Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclic sulfolene has been developed. A range of structrally diverse and enantioenriched C2 or C3 substituted cyclic sulfones are conveniently synthesized by this method. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Cyclic sulfones have demonstrated important applications in drug discovery. However, the catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyclic sulfones remains challenging. Herein, we develop nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of sulfolenes to streamline the synthesis of chiral alkyl cyclic sulfones. The method has broad scope and high functional group tolerance. The regioselectivity can be controlled by ligands only. A neutral PYROX ligand favors C3&#8208;alkylation whereas an anionic BOX ligand favors C2&#8208;alkylation. This control is kinetic in origin as the C2&#8208;bound Ni intermediates are always thermodynamically more stable. Reactivity study of a wide range of relevant Ni intermediates reveal a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle with a NiII&#8722;H species as the resting state. The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining step is the insertion of this NiII&#8722;H species into 2&#8208;sulfolene. This work provides an efficient catalytic method for the synthesis of an important class of organic compounds and enhances the mechanistic understanding of Ni&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective hydroalkylation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A longitudinally helical molecular carbon featuring six benzene rings benzannulated to zigzag edges of a heptacene core, was synthesized by Lei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202407547). The steric congestion introduced by the benzannulation pattern causes the molecular carbon to adopt a helical heptacene core with local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The molecular carbon with two&#8208;dimensional crystal packing exhibits excellent charge transport properties.

Superchaotropic boron clusters have been systematically studied to understand the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos across lipid membranes and inside cells. In their Research Article (e202404286), Irene Lostal&#233;&#8208;Seijo, Werner M. Nau, Javier Montenegro et&#8197;al. showed that size and polarizability are more important than the chemical composition of the clusters, establishing the bases for the prediction of their carrier potential and toxicity.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch at the Heterojunction of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch is crucial for the efficiency and lifetime of perovskite solar cells because it affects interfacial charge behavior and perovskite degradation. This review discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, carrier dynamics, and detailed characterizations. It also exposes challenges to mitigate mismatch as well as a solution and outlook to promote renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;technology advancements.







Abstract
Lattice mismatch significantly influences microscopic transport in semiconducting devices, affecting interfacial charge behavior and device efficacy. This atomic&#8208;level disordering, often overlooked in previous research, is crucial for device efficiency and lifetime. Recent studies have highlighted emerging challenges related to lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells, especially at heterojunctions, revealing issues like severe tensile stress, increased ion migration, and reduced carrier mobility. This review systematically discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, and carrier dynamics. It also includes detailed characterizations of these phenomena and summarizes current strategies including epitaxial growth and buffer layer, as well as explores future solutions to mitigate mismatch&#8208;induced issues. We also provide the challenges and prospects for lattice mismatch, aiming to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, and contribute to renewable energy technology advancements.

         <title>Redox Approaches to Carbene Generation in Catalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the cyclopropanation of alkenes using carbenes generated reductively from gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes/carbonyl compounds or oxidatively from methylene groups.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions have a century&#8208;old history in organic chemistry and are a primary method for the synthesis of cyclopropanes. Much of the work in this field has focused on the use of diazo compounds and related precursors, which can transfer a carbene fragment to a catalyst with concomitant loss of a stable byproduct. Despite the utility of this approach, there are persistent limitations in the scope of viable carbenes, most notably those lacking stabilizing substituents. By coupling carbene transfer chemistry with two&#8208;electron redox cycles, it is possible to expand the available starting materials that can be used as carbene precursors. In this Minireview, we discuss emerging catalytic reductive cyclopropanation reactions using either gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes or carbonyl compounds. This strategy is inspired by classic stoichiometric transformations, such as the Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and the Clemmensen reduction, but instead entails the formation of a catalytically generated transition metal carbene or carbenoid. We also present recent efforts to generate carbenes directly from methylene (CR2H2) groups via a formal 1,1&#8208;dehydrogenation. These reactions are currently restricted to substrates containing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which serve to facilitate deprotonation and subsequent oxidation of the anion.

         <dc:description>
The integration of BINOL derivatives into the supramolecular architectures of chiral macrocycles and cages offers distinct advantages in applications such as circularly polarized luminescence, enantiomer separation, biological transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chirality, a fundamental principle in chemistry, biology, and medicine, is prevalent in nature and in organisms. Chiral molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are crucial in biomolecular synthesis, as well as in the development of functional materials. Among these, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL) stands out for its stable chiral configuration, versatile functionality, and commercial availability. BINOL is widely employed in asymmetric catalysis and chiral materials. This review mainly focuses on recent research over the past five years concerning the use of BINOL derivatives for constructing chiral macrocycles and cages. Their contributions to chiral luminescence, enantiomeric separation, transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis were examined.

The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques.

Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near&#8208;zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasizing original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays. Additionally, mapping the (electro)chemical reactivity in space provides valuable information on nanomaterials and facilitates deciphering ECL mechanisms for improving their performances in diagnostics and (electro)catalysis. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging at the ultimate limits of single molecules, single photons or single chemical reactions, and the current challenges to translate the ECL imaging advances to other fields such as material science, catalysis and biology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near-zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasizing original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays. Additionally, mapping the (electro)chemical reactivity in space provides valuable information on nanomaterials and facilitates deciphering ECL mechanisms for improving their performances in diagnostics and (electro)catalysis. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging at the ultimate limits of single molecules, single photons or single chemical reactions, and the current challenges to translate the ECL imaging advances to other fields such as material science, catalysis and biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective 1,12&#8208;Addition of Alkynyl Biphenyl Quinone Methides Formed In Situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed 1,12&#8208;addition of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates to alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols furnished a wide range of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in high yields with good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of quinone methides formed in situ has been flourishing in recent years. In sharp contrast, the development and utilization of biphenyl quinone methides are rare. In this study, we achieved a remote stereocontrolled 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition of biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ for the first time. In the presence of a suitable chiral phosphoric acid, alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides were generated from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols, followed by enantioselective 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition with indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates. The strategy enabled the alcohols to serve as efficient allenylation reagents, providing practical access to a broad range of axially chiral allenes bearing a (1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;ol unit, which were previously less accessible. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism, indicating that enantioselectivity originates from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, not only the presence of biphenyl quinone methides as versatile intermediates was confirmed but also organocatalytic enantioselective 1,12&#8208;addition was established.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Formal C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylations via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling with Versatile Arylsulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation via the dibenzothiophenylation/nickel&#8208;catalyzed eXEC sequence is presented. The first activation step selectively gives aryldibenzothiophenium salts, which are subsequently engaged in electroreductive nickel catalysis. The method provides various C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) linkages with high sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon contents. The demonstration of one&#8208;pot alkylations further reinforces the practicality of our approach.







Abstract
Producing sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon&#8208;enriched molecules is of particular interest due to their high success rate in clinical trials. The installation of aliphatic chains onto aromatic scaffolds was accomplished by nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with arylsulfonium salts. Thus, simple non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes could be alkylated through the formation of aryldibenzothiophenium salts. The reaction employs an electrochemical approach to avoid potentially hazardous chemical redox agents, and importantly, the one&#8208;pot alkylation proved also viable, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligand Enables Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Propargyl C&#8722;H Functionalization via Reactive Gold Allenylidene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive gold allenylidenes are catalytically generated via ligand&#8208;enabled redox decomposition of alkynylbenziodoxole substrates. In cooperation with gold, a remote amide group in the biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligand is remarkably capable of deprotonating at the propargylic position. DFT calculations offer support to the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Gold allenylidene species have been seldom exploited as reactive intermediates in synthetically versatile catalytic reactions. By employing alkynylbenziodoxoles as the substrates and bifunctional WangPhos as the metal ligand, this work demonstrated ready catalytic access to these intermediates of general substitution patterns and their electrophilic reactivities at the &#947;&#8208;carbon center with a diverse range of nucleophiles. The reaction is driven by the reductive decomposition of the benziodoxole moiety and achieves the replacement of a propargylic proton with an N/O/C&#8208;based nucleophile, hence realizing reactivity umpolung. Corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the reaction mechanism involves a mild propargylic deprotonation. In contrast to prior works employing a tertiary amine functionality, a weakly Br&#216;nsted&#8208;basic amide group in WangPhos is surprisingly effective in deprotonation at the propargylic position under a gold&#8208;ligand cooperation regime.

         <title>A BRD4&#8208;Targeting Photothermal Agent for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent was developed for controlled protein degradation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the photothermal agent could efficiently induce BRD4 protein degradation, inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function and ultimately achieving low&#8208;temperature PTT of cancer cells.







Abstract
BRD4 protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Disrupting the activity of BRD4 has emerged as a promising strategy for inhibiting the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Herein, we introduced a BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent for controlled protein degradation, aiming to enhance low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment. By incorporating a BRD4 protein inhibitor into a cyanine dye scaffold, the photothermal agent specifically bond to the bromodomain of BRD4. Upon low power density laser irradiation, the agent induced protein degradation, directly destroying the BRD4 structure and inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function. This strategy not only prolonged the retention time of the photothermal agent in cancer cells but also confined the targeted protein degradation process solely to the tumor tissue, minimizing side effects on normal tissues through the aid of exogenous signals. This work established a simple and feasible platform for future PTT agent design in clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>Advancing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Isoreticular Cluster Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new dimension to isoreticular chemistry is enabled by using isoreticular cluster concept to develop a series of hierarchical clusters whose co&#8208;assembly can follow different pathways dictated by a delicate balance between various competing chemical interactions.







Abstract
Trigonal planar M3(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high&#8208;impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M3(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double&#8208;deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned MOFs called M3M6 pacs made from co&#8208;assembly between M3 single&#8208;deck trimer and M3x2 double&#8208;deck trimer. Important factors were identified on this multi&#8208;modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M3M6 pacs by overcoming the formation of previously&#8208;always&#8208;observed same&#8208;cluster phases. The new pacs materials exhibit high surface area and high uptake capacity for CO2 and small hydrocarbons, as well as selective adsorption properties relevant to separation of industrially important mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4. Furthermore, new M3M6 pacs materials show electrocatalytic properties with high activity.

     alt="Advancing Pore-Space-Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Isoreticular Cluster Concept"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new dimension to isoreticular chemistry is enabled by using isoreticular cluster concept to develop a series of hierarchical clusters whose co-assembly can follow different pathways dictated by a delicate balance between various competing chemical interactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trigonal planar M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high-impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double-deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore-space-partitioned MOFs called M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;pacs&lt;/i&gt; made from co-assembly between M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single-deck trimer and M&lt;sub&gt;3x2&lt;/sub&gt; double-deck trimer. Important factors were identified on this multi-modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;pacs&lt;/i&gt; by overcoming the formation of previously-always-observed same-cluster phases. The new &lt;i&gt;pacs&lt;/i&gt; materials exhibit high surface area and high uptake capacity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and small hydrocarbons, as well as selective adsorption properties relevant to separation of industrially important mixtures such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, new M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;pacs&lt;/i&gt; materials show electrocatalytic properties with high activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Stable Water&#8208;Soluble Supratomic Silver Clusters Utilizing A Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Protected Strategy: Giant Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type Ag8@Nb162 Fluorescent Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyoxoniobate&#8208;protected approach has been introduced for the first time, aiming to synthesize stable and water&#8208;soluble silver nanoclusters. Employing this method, we have successfully synthesized a giant Ag8@Nb162 core&#8211;shell nanocluster exhibiting reversible temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence responses. Leveraging these fluorescence features, we have demonstrated a sophisticated multiple optical encryption mode with potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit technology.







Abstract
Atomically precise low&#8208;nuclearity (n&lt;10) silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have garnered significant interest due to their size&#8208;dependent optical properties and diverse applications. However, their synthesis has remained challenging, primarily due to their inherent instability. The present study introduces a new feasible approach for clustering silver ions utilizing highly negative and redox&#8208;inert polyoxoniobates (PONbs) as all&#8208;inorganic ligands. This strategy not only enables the creation of novel Ag&#8208;PONb composite nanoclusters but also facilitates the synthesis of stable low&#8208;nuclearity AgNCs. Using this method, we have successfully synthesized a small octanuclear rhombic [Ag8]6+ AgNC stabilized by six highly negative [LiNb27O75]14&#8722; polyoxoanions. This marks the first PONb&#8208;protected superatomic AgNC, designated as {Ag8@(LiNb27O75)6} (Ag8@Nb162), with an aesthetically spherical core&#8211;shell structure. The crystalline Ag8@Nb162 is stable under ambient conditions, What's more, it is water&#8208;soluble and able to maintain its molecular cluster structure intact in water. Further, the stable small [Ag8]6+ AgNC has interesting temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent reversible fluorescence response, based on which a multiple optical encryption mode for anti&#8208;counterfeit technology was demonstrated. This work offers a promising avenue for the synthesis of fascinating and stable PONb&#8208;protected AgNCs and sheds light on the development of new&#8208;type optical functional materials.

         <title>Adaptive Response to Solvation in Flexible Molecules: Oligo Hydrates of 4&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise Hydration of a flexible organic molecule reveals how water solvation scaffolds deforms the substrate structure, generally through different structural pathways. In this experiment we observed solvation with up to five water molecules for 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, using broadband microwave spectroscopy. Solvation is accompanied by multiple isomerization, as two isomers were rotationally detected for each cluster.







Abstract
Structural changes induced by water play a pivotal role in chemistry and biology but remain challenging to predict, measure, and control at molecular level. Here we explore size&#8208;governed gas&#8208;phase water aggregation in the flexible molecule 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, modeling the conformational adaptability of flexible substrates to host water scaffolds and the preference for sequential droplet growth. The experiment was conducted using broadband rotational spectroscopy, rationalized with quantum chemical calculations. Two different isomers were observed experimentally from the di&#8208; to the pentahydrates (4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone&#8208;(H2O)n=2&#8211;5), including the 18O isotopologues for the di&#8208; and trihydrates. Interestingly, to accommodate water molecules effectively, the heavy atom skeleton of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone reshapes in every observed isomer and does not correspond to the stable conformer of the free monomer. All solvates initiate from the alcohol group (proton donor) but retain the carbonyl group as secondary binding point. The water scaffolds closely resemble those found in the pure water clusters, balancing between the capability of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone for steering the orientation and position of the water molecules and the ability of water to modulate the monomer's conformation. The present work thus provides an accurate molecular description on how torsionally flexible molecules dynamically adapt to water along progressing solvation.

         <title>Type&#8197;I Photoinitiator Based on Sustainable Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as Type&#8197;I photoinitiators (PI) for traditional free radical photopolymerization. The polymer networks obtained exhibit less inhomogeneity compared to traditional phosphine oxide photoinitiators. The remarkably lower migration rate of the CD based PIs gives hope to solve toxicological issues arising with some traditional PIs.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as photoinitiators for traditional free radical photopolymerization. Carbon dots were made following a solvothermal procedure from sustainable furfural available from lignocellulose. Surficial aldehyde moieties reacted with hydroxylamine to the respective oxime while reaction with benzoyl chloride resulted in a biobased Type&#8197;I photoinitiator comprising sustainable carbon dot (CD&#8208;PI). Photoinitiating ability was compared with the traditional photoinitiator (PI) ethyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphinate (TPO&#8208;L) by real&#8208;time FTIR with UV exposure at 365&#8197;nm. Photopolymer composition based on a mixture of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) resulted in a similar final conversion of about 70&#8201;% using either CD&#8208;PI or TPO&#8208;L. Nevertheless, it appeared homogeneous in the case of compositions processed with CD&#8208;PI, while those made with TPO&#8208;L were heterogeneous as shown by two glass transition temperatures. Moreover, the migration rate of CD&#8208;PI in the cured samples was lower in comparison with those samples using TPO&#8208;L as PI.

         <title>A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (TTM&#8208;I). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky&#8208;blue color and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In&#8208;depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.

     alt="A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near-Infrared Emission"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (&lt;b&gt;TTM-I&lt;/b&gt;). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the &lt;b&gt;TTM-TTM&lt;/b&gt; diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature.

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H (N&#8208;Phenyltetrazole)thiolation as an Enabling Tool for Molecular Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C&#8722;H bonds allows access to N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers which are elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The reaction proceeds via radical&#8208;chain hydrogen atom transfer by the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical with substrate as limiting reagent in all cases.







Abstract
Methods enabling the broad diversification of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds from a common intermediate are especially valuable in chemical synthesis. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using a commercially available disulfide to access N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers. The thioether products are readily elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The C&#8722;H functionalization proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving hydrogen atom transfer by the electron&#8208;poor N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical. Hexafluoroisopropanol was found to be essential to reactions involving aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H thiolation, with computational analysis consistent with dual hydrogen bonding of the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical imparting increased radical electrophilicity to facilitate the hydrogen atom transfer. Substrate is limiting reagent in all cases, and the reaction displays an exceptional functional group tolerance well suited to applications in late&#8208;stage diversification.

Be&#8208;containing nitrides are sparsely investigated. The herein presented Be2PN3 expands the synthetic approach to highly condensed beryllium nitrides under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions.

Abstract
Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high&#8208;pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite&#8208;type Be2PN3, which was synthesized from Be3N2 and P3N5 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type M2PN3 (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be2PN3 is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by 9Be and 31P solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present 9Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low&#8208;density material. The formation of Be2PN3 through a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be&#8208;containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.

Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been achieved through a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives. Moreover, rapid access of S&#8208;BCOs, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Zn(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed uncommon [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of BCBs.







Abstract
The exploration of the complex chemical diversity of bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes and their use as benzene bioisosteres has garnered significant attention over the past two decades. Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) using a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives have been established. The first hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition of BCBs, catalyzed by Zn(OTf)2, was achieved with a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. In contrast, the less electrophilic BCB ester undergoes a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] reaction with 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes, yielding BCHs with a spirocyclic quaternary carbon center. Control experiments and preliminary theoretical calculations suggest that the diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] product formation may involve a concerted cycloaddition between a zwitterionic intermediate and E&#8208;1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition may involve a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism.

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Heavy Pnictogen Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manuscript describes the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted addition of pnictogen&#8208;pnictogen double bonds to a late transition metal. The use of light has been essential to unlock the reactivity of this otherwise unreactive class of compounds.







Abstract
The chemistry of light dipnictenes has been widely investigated in the last century with remarkable achievements especially for azobenzene derivatives. In contrast, distibenes and dibismuthenes are relatively rare and show very limited reactivity. Herein, we have designed a protocol using visible light to enhance the reactivity of heavy dipnictenes. Exploiting the distinctive &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, we have been able to isolate unique examples of dipnictene&#8208;cobalt complexes. The reactivity of the distibene complex was further exploited using red light in the presence of a diazoolefin to access an unusual four&#8208;membered bicyclo[1.1.0]butane analog, containing only a single carbon atom.

     alt="Light-Dependent Reactivity of Heavy Pnictogen Double Bonds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manuscript describes the first example of visible-light-promoted addition of pnictogen-pnictogen double bonds to a late transition metal. The use of light has been essential to unlock the reactivity of this otherwise unreactive class of compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of light dipnictenes has been widely investigated in the last century with remarkable achievements especially for azobenzene derivatives. In contrast, distibenes and dibismuthenes are relatively rare and show very limited reactivity. Herein, we have designed a protocol using visible light to enhance the reactivity of heavy dipnictenes. Exploiting the distinctive &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, we have been able to isolate unique examples of dipnictene-cobalt complexes. The reactivity of the distibene complex was further exploited using red light in the presence of a diazoolefin to access an unusual four-membered bicyclo[1.1.0]butane analog, containing only a single carbon atom. These findings set the bases to a conceptually new strategy in heavy element double bonds chemistry where visible light is at the front seat of bond activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Planar Tetranuclear Uranium Hydride Cluster Supported by ansa&#8208;Bis(cyclopentadienyl) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>

The first example of a U4H8 cluster was stabilized by ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligands, representing the largest uranium hydride cluster reported to date. The four uranium centers are arranged in planar rhombic geometry, which differs from the polyhedral geometry observed in previously reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters.







Abstract
Polynuclear metal hydride clusters play important roles in various catalytic processes, with most of the reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters adopting a polyhedral three&#8208;dimensional structure. Herein, we report the first example of a planar tetranuclear uranium hydride cluster [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]4(&#956;2&#8208;H)4(&#956;3&#8208;H)4 (U4H8). It was synthesized by reacting an ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand&#8208;supported uranium chloride precursor [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2 with NaHBEt3. The presence of hydrides in U4H8 was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and its reactivity with phenol and carbon tetrachloride. DFT calculations also facilitated the determination of the hydrides&#8217; positions in U4H8, featuring four bridging &#956;2&#8208;H ligands and four face&#8208;capping &#956;3&#8208;H ligands, with the four U centers arranged in a rhombic geometry. The U4H8 represents not only the first example of planar polynuclear actinide metal hydride cluster but also the uranium hydride cluster with the highest nuclearity reported to date.

         <title>Fluorophilic Sigma(&#963;)&#8208;Lock Self&#8208;Healable Copolymers</title>

Autonomous damage&#8208;repair in commodity poly(pentafluorostyrene/n&#8208;butyl acrylate) [p(PFS/n&#8208;BA)} copolymers via lateral dipolar forces between C&#8722;F aromatic and CH3CH2&#8722; aliphatic ends through &#963;&#8208;&#963; orbitals forming fluorophilic sigma(&#963;)&#8208;lock.







Abstract
Although F&#8208;Containing molecules and macromolecules are often used in molecular biology to increase the binding with Lewis acidic groups by introducing favorable C&#8722;F dipoles, there is virtually no experimental evidence and limited understanding of the nature of these interactions, especially their role in synthetic polymeric materials. These studies elucidate the molecular origin of inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;Chain interactions responsible for self&#8208;healing of F&#8208;Containing copolymers composed of pentafluorostyrene and n&#8208;butyl acrylate units (p(PFS/nBA). Guided by dynamic surface oscillating force (SOF) and spectroscopic measurements supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these studies show that the reformation of &#963;&#8208;&#963; orbitals in &#8722;C&#8722;F of PFS and CH3CH2&#8722; of nBA units enables the recovery of entropic energy via fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals forces when PFS/nBA molar ratios are ~50/50. The strength of these interactions determined experimentally for self&#8208;healable PFS/nBA compositions is in the order ~0.3&#8197;kcal/mol which primarily comes from fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock (~70&#8201;%) contributions. These interactions are significantly diminished for non&#8208;self&#8208;healable counterparts. Strongly polarized &#8722;C&#8722;F &#963; orbitals create lateral dipolar forces enhancing the affinity towards &#8722;C&#8722;H orbitals, facilitating energetically favorable interactions. Entropic recovery driven by non&#8208;Covalent bonding offers a valuable tool in designing materials with unique functionalities, particularly self&#8208;healable batteries and energy storage devices.

         <title>Hexabenzoheptacene: A Longitudinally Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Local Aromaticity and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of longitudinally twisted molecular nanocarbons, composed of six benzene rings periodically benzannulated to both zigzag edges of a heptacene core, has been synthesized and characterized. The new molecular nanocarbons adopt helical conformations with local aromaticity and enhanced stability while maintaining the electronic properties and packing motif necessary to serve as functional materials for organic electronic devices.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a longitudinally helical molecular nanocarbon, hexabenzoheptacene (HBH), along with its dimethylated derivative (HBH&#8208;Me), which are composed of six benzene rings periodically benzannulated to both zigzag edges of a heptacene core. This benzannulation pattern endows the resulting nanocarbons with a helical heptacene core and local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The chiral HBH&#8208;Me adopts a more highly twisted conformation with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 95&#176;, enabling the separation of the enantiomers. Both HBH and HBH&#8208;Me can be facilely oxidized into their corresponding dications, which exhibit enhanced planarity and aromaticity upon loss of electrons. Notably, both longitudinally helical nanocarbons readily promote solid state packing into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arrangement. Single&#8208;crystal microbelts of HBH&#8208;Me show hole mobility up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, illustrating the promising potential of these longitudinally helical molecules for organic electronic devices.

         <title>Scalable Total Synthesis of Acremolactone&#8197;B</title>

         <dc:description>
The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of acremolactone&#8197;B, a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide, has been achieved by using an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization strategy.







Abstract
Acremolactone&#8197;B is a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide. The first total synthesis of this molecule was achieved on a gram scale, based on an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization strategy for construction of the tetra&#8208;substituted pyridine ring. A bicyclic intermediate was expeditiously prepared by using [2+2] photocycloaddition and chemoselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation, which was further elaborated to a densely substituted aza&#8208;triene. An electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade was utilized to forge the tetracyclic core of this natural product, and the side chain was introduced through diastereoselective acylation and reduction.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8211;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8211;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8211;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8211;S bond from 2.24 &#197; to 2.30 &#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8211;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8211;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8210;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8211;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates&#160;that Cu&#8211;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx HTM, the&#160;TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7% for TP&#8208;MN (1).&#160;Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups, and NiOx HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#160;h.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics with Exceptional Conductivity by Polymer&#8208;Dopant Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high electrical conductivity (&#963;) and power factor (PF) simultaneously remains a significant challenge for n&#8208;type organic themoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we demonstrate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OTEs performance through blending a fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and its selenophene&#8208;substituted analogue f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN with a julolidine&#8208;functionalized benzimidazoline n&#8208;dopant JLBI, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis when blended with commercially available n&#8208;dopants TAM and N&#8208;DMBI. The advantages of introducing a more lipophilic julolidine group into the dopant structure of JLBI are evidenced by the enhanced OTEs performance that JLBI&#8208;doped films show when compared to those doped with N&#8208;DMBI or TAM. In fact, thanks to the enhanced intermolecular interactions and the lower&#8208;lying LUMO level enabled by the increase of selenophene content in polymer backbone, JLBI&#8208;doped films of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN exhibit a unprecedent &#963; of 206 S cm&#8722;1 and a PF of 114 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. Interestingly, &#963; can be further enhanced up to 326 S cm&#8722;1 by using TAM dopant as a consequence of its favorable diffusion behavior into densely packed crystalline domains. These values are the highest to date for solution&#8208;processed molecularly n&#8208;doped polymers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the polymer&#8208;dopant matching approach carried out in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>From Plastic Waste to Green Hydrogen and Valuable Chemicals Using Sunlight and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental procedure generally involves two distinct processes: (1) pre&#8208;treatment of original plastics; and (2) photoreforming of these treated molecules. The initial stage is essential for the breakdown of long carbon chains into smaller components via pulverization and monomerization, while the subsequent stage focuses on transforming these components into economically valuable products through photoreforming. Plastic photoreforming employs a photocatalyst, typically a semiconductor, that absorbs sunlight and initiating chemical reactions. This approach has the capacity to convert plastic waste into high&#8208;value chemicals and generate hydrogen (H2) through water splitting under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Over 79&#8201;% of 6.3 billion tonnes of plastics produced from 1950 to 2015 have been disposed in landfills or found their way to the oceans, where they will reside for up to hundreds of years before being decomposed bringing upon significant dangers to our health and ecosystems. Plastic photoreforming offers an appealing alternative by using solar energy and water to transform plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemical commodities, while simultaneously producing green hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review aims to provide an overview of the underlying principles of emerging plastic photoreforming technologies, highlight the challenges associated with experimental protocols and performance assessments, discuss recent global breakthroughs on the photoreforming of plastics, and propose perspectives for future research. A critical assessment of current plastic photoreforming studies shows a lack of standardised conditions, hindering comparison amongst photocatalyst performance. Guidelines to establish a more accurate evaluation of materials and systems are proposed, with the aim to facilitate the translation of promising fundamental discovery in photocatalysts design.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Acetylene Hydrogenation in Concentrated Seawater at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cation of concentrated seawater was demonstrated to promote C2H2 hydrogenation to C2H4. Benefiting from this, FE of C2H4 is higher than 97&#8201;% at 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in concentrated seawater. An integrated system was designed for C2H4 and H2 production from C2H2 and seawater.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene (E&#8208;AHE) is a promising alternative for thermal&#8208;catalytic process, yet it suffers from low current densities and efficiency. Here, we achieved a 71.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of E&#8208;AHE at a large partial current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using concentrated seawater as an electrolyte, which can be recycled from the brine waste (0.96&#8197;M NaCl) of alkaline seawater electrolysis (ASE). Mechanistic studies unveiled that cation of concentrated seawater dynamically prompted unsaturated interfacial water dissociation to provide protons for enhanced E&#8208;AHE. As a result, compared with freshwater, a twofold increase of FE of E&#8208;AHE was achieved on concentrated seawater&#8208;based electrolysis. We also demonstrated an integrated system of ASE and E&#8208;AHE for hydrogen and ethylene production, in which the obtained brine output from ASE was directly fed into E&#8208;AHE process without any further treatment for continuously cyclic operations. This innovative system delivered outstanding FE and selectivity of ethylene surpassed 97.0&#8201;% and 97.5&#8201;% across wide&#8208;industrial current density range (&#8804; 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively. This work provides a significant advance of electrocatalytic ethylene production coupling with brine refining of seawater electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation to ethylene (E-AHE) is a promising alternative for thermal-catalytic process, yet it suffers from low current densities and efficiency. Here, we achieved a 71.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of E-AHE at a large partial current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; using concentrated seawater as an electrolyte, which can be recycled from the brine waste (0.96&#8197;M NaCl) of alkaline seawater electrolysis (ASE). Mechanistic studies unveiled that cation of concentrated seawater dynamically prompted unsaturated interfacial water dissociation to provide protons for enhanced E-AHE. As a result, compared with freshwater, a twofold increase of FE of E-AHE was achieved on concentrated seawater-based electrolysis. We also demonstrated an integrated system of ASE and E-AHE for hydrogen and ethylene production, in which the obtained brine output from ASE was directly fed into E-AHE process without any further treatment for continuously cyclic operations. This innovative system delivered outstanding FE and selectivity of ethylene surpassed 97.0&#8201;% and 97.5&#8201;% across wide-industrial current density range (&#8804; 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP = polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000 h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits the metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75% yield, 99% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization in Ag&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the substantial role of ammonia, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion has attracted increasing interest. Herein, we proposed a feasible strategy of p&#8208;d orbital hybridization via doping p&#8208;block metals in an Ag host, which drastically promotes the performance of nitrate adsorption and disassociation. Typically, a Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5 &#177; 1.85 % for NH3 at &#8208;0.4 V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3 &#177; 14.1 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2 % at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.1 A cm&#8208;2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high&#8208;quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi&#8208; and In&#8208;doped Ag catalysts. Moreover, when integrated into a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, such a SnAg cathode contributes to a superior energy density of 639 Wh L&#8208;1, high power density of 18.1 mW cm&#8208;2, and continuous NH3 production.</dc:description>

Typically, a Sn-doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5 &#177; 1.85 % for NH3 at -0.4 V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3 &#177; 14.1 mg h-1 mgcat.-1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2 % at an ampere-level current density of 1.1 A cm-2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6 mg h-1 cm-2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high-quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p-d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate-determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi- and In-doped Ag catalysts.

         <title>Halogen Tailoring of Platinum Electrocatalyst with High CO Tolerance for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of platinum for the CO oxidation depends on the interaction of electron donation and back&#8208;donation at the platinum center. Here we demonstrate that the platinum bromine nanoparticles with electron&#8208;rich properties on bromine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (PtBr NPs/Br&#8208;GDY), which is formed by bromine ligand and constitutes an electrocatalyst with a high CO&#8208;resistant for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The catalyst showed peak mass activity for MOR as high as 10.4 A mgPt&#8722;1, which is 20.8 times higher than the 20% Pt/C. The catalyst also showed robust long&#8208;term stability with slight current density decay after 100 hours at 35 mA cm&#8722;2. Structural characterization, experimental, and theoretical studies show that the electron donation from bromine makes the surface of platinum catalysts highly electron&#8208;rich, and can strengthen the adsorption of CO as well as enhance &#960; back&#8208;donation of Pt to weaken the C&#8722;O bond to facilitate CO electrooxidation and enhance catalytic performance during MOR. The results highlight the importance of electron&#8208;rich structure among active sites in Pt&#8208;halogen catalysts and provide detailed insights into the new mechanism of CO electrooxidation to overcome CO poisoning at the Pt center on an orbital level.</dc:description>

         <title>The Coking of a Solid Catalyst Rationalized with Combined Raman and Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of carbon deposits is a major deactivation pathway for solid catalysts. Studying coking on industrially relevant catalysts is, however, often challenging due to the sample heterogeneity. That is especially true for zeolite&#8208;containing catalysts where fluorescence often hampers their characterization with Raman spectroscopy. We turned this disadvantage into an advantage and combined Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy to study the coking behavior of an equilibrium catalyst material used for fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. The results presented illustrate that this approach can yield new insights in the physicochemical processes occurring within zeolite&#8208;containing catalyst particles during their coking process. Ex situ analyses of single catalyst particles revealed considerable intra&#8208;sample heterogeneities. The sample&#8208;averaged Raman spectra showed a higher degree of graphitization when the sample was exposed to more hexane, while the sample&#8208;averaged fluorescence lifetime showed no significant trend. Simultaneous in situ Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy, used to follow the coking of single particles, gave more insights in the changing fluorescence dynamics. The rise and decline of the average fluorescence lifetime suggested the prolonged presence of smaller coke species that are quenched more and more by adjacent larger polyaromatics acting as F&#246;rster&#8208;resonance&#8208;energy&#8208;transfer acceptors.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of carbon deposits is a major deactivation pathway for solid catalysts. Studying coking on industrially relevant catalysts is, however, often challenging due to the sample heterogeneity. That is especially true for zeolite-containing catalysts where fluorescence often hampers their characterization with Raman spectroscopy. We turned this disadvantage into an advantage and combined Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy to study the coking behavior of an equilibrium catalyst material used for fluid catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. The results presented illustrate that this approach can yield new insights in the physicochemical processes occurring within zeolite-containing catalyst particles during their coking process. Ex situ analyses of single catalyst particles revealed considerable intra-sample heterogeneities. The sample-averaged Raman spectra showed a higher degree of graphitization when the sample was exposed to more hexane, while the sample-averaged fluorescence lifetime showed no significant trend. Simultaneous in situ Raman and fluorescence (lifetime) microscopy, used to follow the coking of single particles, gave more insights in the changing fluorescence dynamics. The rise and decline of the average fluorescence lifetime suggested the prolonged presence of smaller coke species that are quenched more and more by adjacent larger polyaromatics acting as F&#246;rster-resonance-energy-transfer acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60 V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50 V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11 times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3M MgBr2 (at 0.6V) and up to 4&#8208;5 times higher adsorption capacity with 3M MgCl2 (at 1V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8208;20% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100 cycles of operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive B&#8208;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Delocalization in Extended Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8208;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the p&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8 eV for the dimer and 1.7 eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731 nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomerisation reactions provide streamlined routes to organic compounds which are otherwise hard to directly synthesise. The most common forms are positional, geometrical or stereochemical isomerisations which involve the relocation of a double bond or a change in relative location of groups in space. In contrast, far fewer examples of structural (or constitutional) isomerisation exist where the connectivity between atoms is altered. The development of platforms capable of such rearrangement poses a unique set of challenges because chemical bonds must be selectively cleaved, and new ones formed without overall addition or removal of atoms. Here, we show that a dual catalytic system can enable the structural isomerisation of readily available allylic alcohols into more challenging&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones via a H&#8208;atom transfer initiated semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement. Key to our strategy is the combination of a cobalt catalyst and photocatalyst under reductive, protic conditions which allows intermediates to propagate catalytic turnover. By providing an unusual disconnection to structural motifs which are difficult to access through direct arylation, we anticipate inspiring other advanced catalytic isomerisation strategies that will further retrosynthetic logic for complex molecule synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds and In&#8208;situ Photoinduced Metallic Bi0/Ni0&#160;Accelerating Z&#8208;scheme Charge Transfer of BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH for Highly Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For heterojunction system, the lack of stable interfacial driving force and definite charge transfer channel makes the charge separation and transfer efficiency unsatisfactory. The photoreaction mechanism occurring at the interface also receives less attention. Herein, a 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with large&#8208;area contact featured by abundant interfacial hydrogen bonds and a strong interfacial electric field (IEF) is synthesized, and in&#8208;situ photoinduced metallic species assisting charge transfer mechanism is demonstrated. The hydrogen bonds between O atoms from BiOBr and H atoms from NiFe&#8208;LDH induce a significant interfacial charge redistribution, establishing a robust IEF. Notably, during photocatalytic reaction, Bi0 and Ni0 are in&#8208;situ isolated from BiOBr and NiFe&#8208;LDH in heterojunction, which separately act as electron transport mediator and electron trap to further accelerate charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2%. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the existence of Bi0 strengthens the IEF. Therefore, high&#8208;speed spatial charge separation is realized in Bi0/BiOBr@Ni0/NiFe&#8208;LDH, leading to a prominent photocatalytic activity with a tetracycline removal ratio of 88.3% within 7 minutes under visible&#8208;light irradiation and the presence of persulfate, far exceeding majority of photocatalysts reported previously. This study provides valid insights for designing hydrogen bonding heterojunction systems, and advances mechanistic understanding on in&#8208;situ photoreaction at interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808 nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Blade&#8208;Coating (100)&#8208;Oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Films via Crystal Surface Energy Regulation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite  Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5 mol% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of phase&#8208;pure, highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16% (~26.5% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable T&#8208;Shaped Planar Silyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of an unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt. The non&#8208;classical geometry enables this silyl anion to feature a silicon&#8208;centred HOMO, LUMO and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. It not only exhibits nucleophilic behaviour but also undergoes oxidative additions to CO2 and arylisonitrile. Notably, it represents the first example of silyl anions capable of cleaving C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silyl anions have garnered significant attention due to their synthetic abilities. However, previously reported silyl anions have been limited to either trigonal&#8208;pyramidal or trigonal&#8208;planar geometries, which confine them primarily as nucleophiles in substitution reactions. Herein, we report the isolation of the unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt 2 by employment of a geometrically constrained triamido pincer ligand. Theoretical calculations disclosed that the silicon centre in 2 possesses both a lone pair of electrons and an empty 3pz orbital. In addition to nucleophilic substitution reactions with Ph3PAuCl and W(CO)6, 2 readily undergoes oxidative additions with CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylisonitrile at room temperature. Furthermore, under mild conditions, compound 2 cleaves Csp2&#8722;H, Csp2&#8722;H, and H&#8722;H bonds in 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene, an intramolecular iPr group, and dihydrogen, representing the first examples of C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H activations mediated by a silyl anion, respectively. This work unveils new reactivity of silyl anions owing to the non&#8208;classical geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Proportion of Grain Boundaries in Zinc Metal Anode Spontaneously Inhibiting Dendrites Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries create abundant nucleation sites, accelerating zinc nucleation and growth rates allowing for the 2D growth kinetics. This offers advantages over the traditional 3D instantaneous nucleation mode of the commercial zinc foil, constrained by limited nucleation sites and kinetics associated with nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an attractive electrochemical energy storage solution for their budget and safe properties. However, dendrites and uncontrolled side reactions in anodes detract the cycle life and energy density of the batteries. Grain boundaries in metals are generally considered as the source of the above problems but we present a diverse result. This study introduces an ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries on zinc electrodes through femtosecond laser bombardment to enhance stability of zinc metal/electrolyte interface. The ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries promotes the homogenization of zinc growth potential, to achieve uniform nucleation and growth, thereby suppressing dendrite formation. Additionally, the abundant active sites mitigate the side reactions during the electrochemical process. Consequently, the 15&#8197;&#956;m Fs&#8722;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves an energy density of 249.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and operates for over 60 cycles at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 23&#8201;%. The recognition of the favorable influence exerted by UP&#8208;GBs paves a new way for other metal batteries.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Distal C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination of Aliphatic Amines as a Gateway for Forging Nitrogen&#8208;Containing sp3 Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in unprotected aliphatic amines has been developed, achieved by tuning of the electronics properties of the proximal C&#8722;H bonds via substrate protonation. Consecutive intramolecular cyclization of alkyl bromide offered a series of N&#8208;containing heterocycles characterized by high ring strains. Moreover, the resulting C(sp3)&#8722;Br serves as a synthetic linchpin can be readily transferred to C(sp3)&#8722;C, N, O bonds, enabling diverse functionalization at previously untouched C(sp3)&#8722;H sites.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new strategy that rapidly and reliably incorporates bromine atoms at distal, secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H sites in aliphatic amines with an excellent and predictable site&#8208;selectivity pattern. The resulting halogenated building blocks serve as versatile linchpins to enable a series of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;formations at remote C(sp3) sites, thus offering a new modular and unified platform that expediates the access to advanced sp3 architectures possessing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles of interest in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>[2.2]Benzoindenophane&#8208;Based Chiral Indenyl Ligands: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both the development of optically pure chiral indenyl rhodium(IndxRh) catalysts and IndxRh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation are challenging and seldom reported. Herein, a class of chiral indenyl ligands bearing a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton is presented. It is convenient to synthesize and easy to modify (13 variations are shown). Importantly, its coordination to rhodium is face&#8208;specific. Moreover, the utilities of its IndxRh catalysts have been demonstrated by two asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Development of chiral indenyl ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation is a longstanding challenge, and extremely few successes have been achieved. In this paper, we describe a class of readily accessible, facilely tunable and user&#8208;friendly chiral indenyl ligands featuring a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton via a divergent synthesis strategy. The corresponding chiral indenyl rhodium catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of O&#8208;Boc hydroxybenzamide with alkenes to give various chiral dihydroisoquinolone products (up to 97&#8201;% yield, up to 98&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of carboxylic acids with alkynes was also successfully accomplished, providing a range of axially chiral isocoumarins (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 94&#8201;% ee). Notably, this represents the first example of enantioselective transition metal catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation/oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes to construct isocoumarins. Given many attractive features of this class of indenyl ligands, such as convenient synthesis, high tunability and exclusive face&#8208;selectivity of coordination, its applications in more catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;H activation and in other asymmetric catalysis are foreseen.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Based Multimeric Aptamer Generation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface&#8208;based room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for multimeric aptamer generation alongside relevant surface bio&#8208;functionalization were employed on nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) working electrodes (WEs) for developing highly sensitive and selective NMIs multimeric aptasensors.







Abstract
Multimeric aptamers have gained more attention than their monomeric counterparts due to providing more binding sites for target analytes, leading to increased affinity. This work attempted to engineer the surface&#8208;based generation of multimeric aptamers by employing the room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique and chemically modified primers for developing a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor. The multimeric aptamers, generated through surface RCA, are hybridized to modified spacer primers, facilitating the positioning of the aptamers in the proximity of sensing surfaces. These multimeric aptamers can be used as bio&#8208;receptors for capturing specific targets. The surface amplification process was fully characterized, and the optimal amplification time for biosensing purposes was determined, using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SP). Interestingly, multimeric aptasensors produced considerably higher response signals and affinity (more than 10&#8208;fold), as well as higher sensitivity (almost 4&#8208;fold) compared to monomeric aptasensors. Furthermore, the impact of surface structures on the response signals was studied by utilizing both flat working electrodes (WEs) and nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) WEs. The NMIs multimeric aptasensors showed significantly higher sensitivity in buffer and saliva media with the limit of detection less than 2&#8197;fg/ml. Finally, the developed NMIs multimeric aptasensors were clinically challenged with several saliva patient samples.

         <title>Redox Engineering of Myoglobin by Cofactor Substitution to Enhance Cyclopropanation Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;diverse myoglobins containing four different cofactors with different redox potentials (&#8722;198 to +147&#8197;mV vs. NHE) were studied as catalysts for alkene cyclopropanation through carbene transfer. Myoglobin with a positive redox potential is highly reactive for electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, such as 1&#8208;octene. In contrast, myoglobin with a negative redox potential accelerates the formation of a detectable carbene intermediate.







Abstract
Design of metal cofactor ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of metalloenzymes. We investigated a carbene transfer reaction catalyzed by myoglobins containing iron porphyrin cofactors with one and two trifluoromethyl groups at peripheral sites (FePorCF3 and FePor(CF3)2, respectively), native heme and iron porphycene (FePc). These four myoglobins show a wide range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potentials in the protein of +147&#8197;mV, +87&#8197;mV, +42&#8197;mV and &#8722;198&#8197;mV vs. NHE, respectively. Myoglobin reconstituted with FePor(CF3)2 has a more positive potential, which enhances the reactivity of a carbene intermediate with alkenes, and demonstrates superior cyclopropanation of inert alkenes, such as aliphatic and internal alkenes. In contrast, engineered myoglobin reconstituted with FePc has a more negative redox potential, which accelerates the formation of the intermediate, but has low reactivity for inert alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that myoglobin with FePor(CF3)2 generates an undetectable active intermediate with a radical character. In contrast, this reaction catalyzed by myoglobin with FePc includes a detectable iron&#8211;carbene species with electrophilic character. This finding highlights the importance of redox&#8208;focused design of the iron porphyrinoid cofactor in hemoproteins to tune the reactivity of the carbene transfer reaction.

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Tafbromin Selectively Targets the TAF1 Bromodomain 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinolone pseudo&#8208;natural product Tafbromin was identified as an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling&#8208;induced osteogenesis. Tafbromin binds to the second bromodomain of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1) with high selectivity over other bromodomains and suppresses the expression of Hedgehog target genes and alkaline phosphatase.







Abstract
Phenotypic assays detect small&#8208;molecule bioactivity at functionally relevant cellular sites, and inherently cover a variety of targets and mechanisms of action. They can uncover new small molecule&#8208;target pairs and may give rise to novel biological insights. By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoline (PQ) pseudo&#8208;natural product (PNP) class of osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.

By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;]quinoline (PQ) pseudo-natural product (PNP) class of osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of the TATA-box binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Creating High&#8208;entropy Single Atoms on Transition Disulfides through Substrate&#8208;induced Redox Dynamics for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt during the HER.







Abstract
The controllable anchoring of multiple metal single&#8208;atoms (SAs) into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while marrying the concentration&#8208;complex multimetallic SAs and high&#8208;entropy SAs (HESAs) into one SAC system remains a substantial challenge. Here, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports, which can precisely control the doping location of SAs. Specially, the contents of SAs can continuously increase until the accessible Mo atoms on TMDs carriers are completely replaced by SAs, thus allowing the of much higher metal contents. In&#8208;depth mechanistic study shows that the well&#8208;controlled synthesis of multimetallic SAs and HESAs is realized by controlling the reversible redox reaction occurred on the TMDs/TM ion interface. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a variety of SAs&#8208;TMDs were applied to hydrogen evolution reaction. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt. Thus, our work will broaden the family of single&#8208;atom catalysts and provide a new guideline for the rational design of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Ring Opening with Vinylbenzofurans Enabled by Triazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;O scission enabled annulations of 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans through a versatile C&#8722;H/C&#8722;O/N&#8722;H functionalization cascade. This reaction was achieved using a peptide&#8208;isosteric triazole and an inexpensive, non&#8208;toxic iron catalyst.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation using readily available 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans as the reaction pattern. The redox&#8208;neutral strategy, based on cheap, non&#8208;toxic, and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysts, exploits triazole assistance to promote a cascade C&#8722;H alkylation, benzofuran ring&#8208;opening and insertion into a Fe&#8722;N bond, to form highly functionalized isoquinolones. Detailed mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations fully disclosed the manifold of the iron catalysis.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Bicyclobutanes with Ynamides for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with ynamides was developed, enabling access to a variety of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. The prepared products serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of novel and functionally diverse bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, showcasing their potential utility in other fields.







Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has gained significant attention in drug discovery due to their potential to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Here, we present a mild and scalable Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with ynamides, yielding a diverse array of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. These products offer valuable starting materials for the construction of novel functionalized bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of ynamides to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated enolate and keteniminium ion. We expect that these findings will encourage utilization of complex bioisosteres and foster further investigation into BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.

         <title>Aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;Diazadiborole Featuring an Unsymmetrical B=B Entity: A Versatile Synthon for Unusual Boron Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole, a BN analogue of cyclopentadienide. Featuring an unsymmetrical B=B entity, this species readily undergoes redox, insertion, addition, and cycloaddition reactions for the synthesis of unusual boron heterocycles. The ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion have been witnessed during these transformations.







Abstract
The replacement of a CC unit with an isoelectronic BN unit in aromatic systems can give rise to molecules and materials with fascinating properties. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole species, 2, featuring an unprecedented 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic BN&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that is isoelectronic to cyclopentadienide (Cp&#8722;). Bearing an unsymmetrical B=B entity, 2 exhibits reactivity toward oxidants, protic reagents, electrophiles, and unsaturated substrates. This reactivity facilitates the synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and bicyclic organoboron derivatives through mechanisms including ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion. These findings reveal innovative synthetic routes to BN&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds via desymmetrization, affording unique building blocks for synthetic chemistry.

Abstract
The formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries is achieved. The two&#8208;electron reduction products feature a unique P42&#8722; structure and can act as a source of P3&#8722;. The treatment of these phosphorus containing products with electrophiles under mild conditions results in the formation of different phosphines. This approach eliminates the need for high temperatures and/or high pressures, which are commonly required in industrial processes for the preparation of useful phosphines.The activation and further functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) by main group complexes has become an increasingly studied topic in recent times. Herein, we report the controlled formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries from the selective reaction of P4 with dialumenes, ([L(IiPr)Al]2) (1: L=Tripp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; 2: L=tBu2MeSi; IiPr=[MeCN(iPr)]2C)). The two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction product of P4 features a P42&#8722; structure and is shown to be able to act as a source of P3&#8722;. Treatments of different electrophiles (e.g., chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl), iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI), HCl, or acetyl chloride (CH3COCl)) with these alanes under mild conditions gave the corresponding phosphines (e.g., P(SiMe3)3, PH3, or P(COCH3)3).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of phosphorus-rich alanes featuring butterfly-like geometries is achieved. The two-electron reduction products feature a unique P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; structure and can act as a source of P&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The treatment of these phosphorus containing products with electrophiles under mild conditions results in the formation of different phosphines. This approach eliminates the need for high temperatures and/or high pressures, which are commonly required in industrial processes for the preparation of useful phosphines.The activation and further functionalization of white phosphorus (P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by main group complexes has become an increasingly studied topic in recent times. Herein, we report the controlled formation of phosphorus-rich alanes featuring butterfly-like geometries from the selective reaction of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with dialumenes, ([L(I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr)Al]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;: L=Tripp=2,4,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;: L=&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MeSi; I&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr=[MeCN(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C)). The two-electron-reduction product of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; features a P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; structure and is shown to be able to act as a source of P&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Treatments of different electrophiles (e.g., chlorotrimethylsilane (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl), iodotrimethylsilane (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiI), HCl, or acetyl chloride (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COCl)) with these alanes under mild conditions gave the corresponding phosphines (e.g., P(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or P(COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8211;Active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We inserted Mn dopants in Co4N, to promote the formation of high&#8208;valence Co4+ during the pre&#8208;catalyst activation process. The energy barrier of phase transformation from CoOOH to CoO2 was lowered by introducing J&#8211;T active Mn3+ cations, because the violent distortion of the Mn3+ (t32ge1g)&#8208;centered octahedra MnO6 reduces the structural stability, and facilitates the H desorption. The consistent relationship between the J&#8211;T dopants and the deep&#8208;oxidation process is proved, and this concept can be extended to other elements. Moreover, the lattice oxygen in Mn doped CoO2 (Mn&#8208;CoO2) is activated to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the direct formation of oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (

) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn&#8208;doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8211;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of the catalyst's electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.

         <title>Trigonal Planar [PN3]4&#8722; Anion in the Nitridophosphate Oxide Ba3[PN3]O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present Ba3[PN3]O, containing the first [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Starting from commercial availably starting materials, we successfully synthesized this compound by a medium pressure reaction using the hot isostatic press. The crystal structure was elucidated by combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM&#8208;EDX, LCC and MAS NMR, whereby the unambiguous assignment of O/N was verified successfully.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates, with their primary structural motif of isolated or condensed PN4 tetrahedra, meet many requirements for high performance materials. Their properties are associated with their structural diversity, which is mainly limited by this specific building block. Herein, we present the alkaline earth metal nitridophosphate oxide Ba3[PN3]O featuring a trigonal planar [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Ba3[PN3]O was obtained using a hot isostatic press by medium&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (MP/HT) at 200&#8197;MPa and 880&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Iwao Ojiama on the occasion of his 80th birthdayA cylindrical molecule with D3&#8208;symmetry was found to serve as versatile vertices to form 2&#8208;dimensional, honeycomb networks of host&#8211;guest complexes. Varying the structural elements of the layered systems enabled a wide range of structural combinations to become accessible.







Abstract
Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8211;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, the stereochemistry of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.

         <title>Management of Triplet States in Modified Mononuclear Ruthenium(II) Complexes for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a Ru(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons to transition their excited state from 3MLCT to 3IL, is presented. RuP&#8208;4 catalyzes CO2 photoreduction to CO with unprecedented performance without additional photosensitizers.







Abstract
Controlling the interplay between relaxation and charge/energy transfer processes in the excited states of photocatalysts is crucial for the performance of artificial photosynthesis. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer triplet states (3MLCT*) of ruthenium(II) complexes are broadly implemented for photocatalysis, but an effective means of managing the triplets for enhanced photocatalysis has been lacking. Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP&#8208;4 decorated with anthracene, sub&#8208;picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to 3MLCT* leads to a charge&#8208;separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra&#8208;ligand triplet state (3IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited&#8208;state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP&#8208;4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited&#8208;state charge/energy flow for the development of long&#8208;lived 3IL multi&#8208;functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.

Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited-state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP-1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP-4 decorated with anthracene, sub-picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT* leads to a charge-separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra-ligand triplet state (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited-state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP-4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited-state charge/energy flow for the development of long-lived &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;IL multi-functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approaching Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Voltage&#8208;Responsive Smart Prelithiation Separator with Surface&#8208;Engineered Sacrificial Lithium Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart lithium compensation strategy by introducing voltage&#8208;responsive prelithiation separator can staged release active lithium, regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries and extending their life. The separator's ability to absorb excess lithium below operating voltage protects the cathode from electrochemical failure or short circuit, enhancing safety and sustainability.







Abstract
The surge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries has heightened concerns regarding metal resource depletion and the environmental impact of spent batteries. Battery recycling has become paramount globally, but conventional techniques, while effective at extracting transition metals like cobalt and nickel from cathodes, often overlook widely used spent LiFePO4 due to its abundant and low&#8208;cost iron content. Direct regeneration, a promising approach for restoring deteriorated cathodes, is hindered by practicality and cost issues despite successful methods like solid&#8208;state sintering. Hence, a smart prelithiation separator based on surface&#8208;engineered sacrificial lithium agents is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic anionic and cationic redox, the prelithiation separator can intelligently release or intake active lithium via voltage regulation. The staged lithium replenishment strategy was implemented, successfully restoring spent LiFePO4&#8217;s capacity to 163.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a doubled life. Simultaneously, the separator can absorb excess active lithium up to approximately 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 below 2.5&#8197;V to prevent over&#8208;lithiation of the cathode This innovative, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective strategy paves the way for the direct regeneration of spent batteries, expanding the possibilities in the realm of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Vapor/Vapor&#8208;Solid Interfacial Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes on Alumina Hollow Fiber for Advanced Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) interfacial method, in which vapor&#8208;phase monomers were introduced onto polydopamine(PDA)&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm within 8&#8197;h, ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 membranes were successfully grown on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers substrate. The resulting filtration module exhibits exceptional stability and performance in continuous inside&#8208;out cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial&#8208;preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina). Through vapor&#8208;phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V&#8722;S interface. This enables one&#8208;step growth within 8&#8197;h, producing 100&#8197;nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80&#8197;h in continuous cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700&#8197;Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V&#8722;S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100&#8211;500&#8197;nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method's potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>New Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Layered Double Perovskite Halides: Synthesis, Structural Transition and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs) have been synthesized by variations of trivalent metal centers in the inorganic layer as well as modifications in the organic spacers. All the HLDPs display ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (kL) with notable anisotropy in&#160;kL&#160;observed for RP&#8208;HLDP (3N&#8208;CuIn) when&#160;measured parallel and perpendicular&#160;to layer stacking.







Abstract
Hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs), representing the two&#8208;dimensional manifestation of halide double perovskites, have elicited considerable interest owing to their intricate chemical bonding hierarchy and structural diversity. This intensified interest stems from the diverse options available for selecting alternating octahedral coordinated trivalent [M(III)] and monovalent metal centers [M(I)], along with the distinctive nature of the cationic organic amine located between the layers. Here, we have synthesized three new compounds with general formula (R&#8242;/R&#8242;&#8242;)4/2M(III)M(I)Cl8; where R&#8242;=C3H7NH3 (i.e. 3N) and R&#8242;&#8242;=NH3C4H8NH3 (i.e. 4N4); M(III)=In3+ or Ru3+; M(I)=Cu+ by simple solution&#8208;based acid precipitation method. The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)2CuInCl8 and (4N4)2CuRuCl8 adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)4CuInCl8 exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure. The alternative octahedra within the inorganic layer display distortions and tilting. Three compounds show temperature&#8208;dependent structural phase transitions where changes in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have been noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300&#8197;K range, marking a distinctive feature within the realm of HLDP systems. The RP&#8208;HLDP compound, (3N)4CuInCl8, demonstrates anisotropy in &#954;L while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow &#954;L of 0.15 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb&#8208;free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow &#954;L in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity and soft crystal structure, which resulted in low&#8208;energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat&#8208;carrying acoustic phonons.

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically compared the influence of phosphorescence emission intensity, lifetime, and wavelength on bioimaging performance, demonstrating that the phosphorescence lifetime is the primary factor. Importantly, the inherent ability of Fe ions to quench the phosphorescence of organic phosphorescent materials was verified. Finally, phosphorescent materials were designed for the specific imaging of liver tumors.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. In addition, there have been few reports on organic phosphorescent materials that specifically distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94&#8197;s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.

Finally, phosphorescent materials were designed for the specific imaging of liver tumors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. In addition, there have been few reports on organic phosphorescent materials that specifically distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo-phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94&#8197;s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood-rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room-temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
We present a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors. This D&#8722;A nanohoop exhibits positive solvatofluorochromic properties and has potential applications in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors. Compared to [12]CPP, D&#8722;A nanohoop exhibited significant changes in physical properties, including a large redshift (&gt;78&#8197;nm) in the fluorescence spectrum and novel positive solvatofluorochromic properties with a maximum peak ranging from 484&#8197;nm to 546&#8197;nm. The potential applications of [12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices were further investigated, and its bipolar behavior as a charge transport active layer was clearly observed.

         <title>Tetraborated Intrinsically Axial Chiral Multi&#8208;resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan/bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene moieties, two pairs of tetraborated chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence enantiomers have been synthesized that show good photophysical and chiroptical properties. The sulfur atoms accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% with dissymmetry factors of 0.59/1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
Chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold promise for circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and 3D displays. Herein, we present two pairs of tetraborated intrinsically axial CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials, R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH, with conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan and bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene as chiral sources, which effectively participate in the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals. Due to the heavy&#8208;atom effect, sulfur atoms are introduced to accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process and increase the efficiency of molecules. R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH manifest ultra&#8208;pure blue emission with a maximum at 458/459&#8197;nm with a full width at half maximum of 27&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;%/91&#8201;%, and dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;4/8.5&#215;10&#8722;4, respectively. Correspondingly, the CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit good performances with an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% and |gEL| factors of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.
