         <title>Pushing The Extreme of Multicentre Bonding: Planar Pentacoordinate Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar hypercoordination has sparkled interest among the researchers from last few decades. Most of the elements in the Periodic Table have shown this remarkable structural feature. However, the smallest element, hydrogen, is missing in the list. No evidence is there in the literature. Herein, we introduce the first planar pentacoordinate hydrogen atom (ppH) in the global minimum geometry of Li5H6&#8209; cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is stabilized by multicentre bonding with five surrounding Li atoms. Natural charge analysis reveals that the central hydrogen is acting like a hydride which is strongly attracted by the positively charged surrounding lithium centres. The ppH structure is stabilized by strong electrostatic attraction as well as extensive multicentre bonding. Aromaticity has no role to play here. The cluster is dynamically stable and is expected to be detected in gas phase.</dc:description>

         <title>1D Covalent Organic Frameworks Triggering Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of H2O2 via Controllable Modular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The topological diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables considerable space for exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this study, we report a sequence of novel 1D COFs (EO, ES, and ESe&#8208;COF) with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology that can be interconnected with VIA group elements (O, S, and Se) via a modular design strategy. It is found that the electronic structures, charge delivery property, light harvesting ability, and hydrophilicity of these 1D COFs can be profoundly influenced by the bridge&#8208;linked atom ordinal. Finally, EO&#8208;COF, possessing the highest quantity of active sites, the longest lifetime of the active electron, the strongest interaction with O2, and the lowest energy barrier of O2 reduction, exhibits exceptional photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 activity under visible light, with a production rate of 2675 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a high apparent quantum yield of 6.57% at 450 nm. This is the first systematic report on 1D COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis, which enriches the topological database in reticular chemistry and promotes the exploration of structure&#8208;catalysis correlation.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Postsynthetic Copolymerization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks into a PolyHOF Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown promise in various fields; however, the construction of HOF/polymer hybrid membranes that can maintain both structural and functional integrity remains challenging. In this study, we here fabricated a new HOF (HOF&#8208;50) with reserved polymerizable allyl group via charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds between the carboxylate anion and amidinium, and subsequently copolymerized the HOF with monomers to construct a covalently bonded HOF/polymer hybrid (polyHOF) membrane. The resulting polyHOF membrane not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties and extreme stability, but also shows an exceptional ratiometric luminescent temperature&#8208;sensing function with very high sensitivity and visibility even when the lanthanide content is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported mixed&#8208;lanthanide metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This orthogonal postsynthesis copolymerization strategy may provide a general approach for preparing covalently connected HOF/polymer hybrid membranes for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Monometallic Aluminum as a Biotuner for Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroptosis is an effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy. However, monometallic pyroptosis biotuners have not been explored until now. Here, we discover for the first time that biodegradable monometallic Al can as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. pH&#8208;sensitive Al nanoparticles (Al@P) are obtained by equipping polyethylene glycol&#8208;b&#8208;(poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8208;co&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine), which can exert their effect at the tumor site without affecting normal cells. The H2 and Al3+ release by Al@P in the acidic environment of tumor disrupts the redox balance and ionic homeostasis in tumor cells, thus generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to caspase&#8208;1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, and IL&#8208;1&#946;/LDH release, which induces canonical pyroptotic death. Meanwhile, prodrug Doxorubicin (Pro&#8208;DOX) is successfully loaded onto Al@P (Al@P&#8208;P) and can be activated by ROS to release DOX in the tumor cells, thus further improving the tumor&#8208;killing efficiency. Ultimately, Al@P&#8208;P has degradability and exhibits efficient tumor inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Polylactic Acid Waste into Alanine under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable plastic because it can be degraded into CO2 and H2O in nature. However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO2 emission and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post&#8208;consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastics economy. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, with a high selectivity (&gt;75%) and excellent stability. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP in&#8208;situ grown on CdS can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation for the coproduction of alanine. This study offers an appealing way for the PLA waste upcycling and creates new opportunities for the green synthesis of amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptisorption of Nonporous Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although our knowledge and understanding of adsorptions in natural and artificial systems has increased dramatically during the past century, adsorption associated with nonporous polymers remains something of a mystery, hampering applications. Here we demonstrate a model system for adaptisorption of nonporous polymers, wherein dative B&#8722;N bonds and host&#8722;guest binding units act as the kinetic and thermodynamic components, respectively. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymer crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals. Adaptisorption of nonporous polymer crystals not only extends the types of adsorption in which the sorbate molecules are integrated in a precise and order manner in the sorbent systems, but also provides a facile and accurate approach to the construction of polymeric materials with precise architectures and integrated functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Catalytic RNA Circuits for Construction of Artificial Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering of genetic networks with artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Engineering of genetic networks with artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells.

         <title>Asymmetric Solvents Regulated Crystallization&#8208;Limited Electrolytes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric solvents regulated crystallization limitation strategy is developed to lower electrolyte operation temperature windows for lithium metal batteries. Mixing asymmetric ethylene sulfite (ES) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) can reduce the molecular interaction and orientation arrangement dynamics, allowing the resulting electrolyte to show fast ion transport even at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Electrolytes that can keep liquid state are one of the most important physical metrics to ensure the ions transfer with stable operation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries at a wide temperature window. It is generally accepted that strong polar solvents with high melting points favor the safe operation of batteries above room temperatures but are susceptible to crystallization at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). Here, a crystallization limitation strategy was proposed to handle this issue. We demonstrate that, although the high melting points of ethylene sulfite (ES, &#8722;17&#8201;&#176;C) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, &#8776;23&#8201;&#176;C), their mixtures can avoid crystallization at low temperatures, which can be attributed to low intermolecular interactions and altered molecular motion dynamics. A suitable ES/FEC ratio (10&#8201;% FEC) can balance the bulk and interface transport of ions, enabling LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||lithium (NCM811||Li) full cells to deliver excellent temperature resilience and cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to +70&#8201;&#176;C. More than 66&#8201;% of the capacity retention was achieved at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C compared to room temperature. The NCM811||Li pouch cells exhibit high cycling stability under realistic conditions (electrolyte weight to cathode capacity ratio (E/C)&#8804;3.5&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P)&#8804;1.09) at different temperatures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Macroscale Sheets Powered by Enzyme Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded nano&#8208;sized enzymes, in the presence of their respective substrates, can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories on the air/water interface.







Abstract
Nanoscale enzymes anchored to surfaces act as chemical pumps by converting chemical energy released from enzymatic reactions into spontaneous fluid flow that propels entrained nano&#8208; and microparticles. Enzymatic pumps are biocompatible, highly selective, and display unique substrate specificity. Utilizing these pumps to trigger self&#8208;propelled motion on the macroscale has, however, constituted a significant challenge and thus prevented their adaptation in macroscopic fluidic devices and soft robotics. Using experiments and simulations, we herein show that enzymatic pumps can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories. In these studies, the sheets are confined to the air/water interface. With the addition of appropriate substrate, the asymmetric enzymatic coating on the sheets induces chemically driven, buoyancy flows that controllably propel the sheet's motion on the air/water interface. The directionality and speed of the motion can be tailored by changing the pattern of the enzymatic coating, type of enzyme, and nature and concentration of the substrate. This work highlights the utility of biocompatible enzymes for generating motion in macroscale fluidic devices and robotics and indicates their potential utility for in vivo applications.

         <title>Reference&#8208;Quality Free Energy Barriers in Catalysis from Machine Learning Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free energy barriers of acid&#8208;catalyzed cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes are computed at an unprecedented level of theory, combining dynamic effects investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics and high&#8208;level electronic energy calculations with Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory. The results are close to chemical accuracy.







Abstract
For the first time, we report calculations of the free energies of activation of cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes that combine several different electronic structure methods with molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the use of a high level of theory (here Random Phase Approximation&#8212;RPA) is necessary to bridge the gap between experimental and computed values. These transformations, catalyzed by zeolites and proceeding via cationic intermediates and transition states, are building blocks of many chemical transformations for valorization of long chain paraffins originating, e.g., from plastic waste, vegetable oils, Fischer&#8211;Tropsch waxes or crude oils. Compared with the free energy barriers computed at the PBE+D2 production level of theory via constrained ab initio molecular dynamics, the barriers computed at the RPA level by the application of Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (MLPT) show a significant decrease for isomerization reaction and an increase of a similar magnitude for cracking, yielding an unprecedented agreement with the results obtained by experiments and kinetic modeling.

         <title>Cable Bacteria Skeletons as Catalytically Active Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological cables as electrodes: Electrically conducting filamentous cable bacteria skeletons were used as free&#8208;standing biological electrodes and displayed catalytic selectivity towards oxygen. The skeletons convert water to oxygen and oxygen back to water. We show that the reactions can be driven either by an external electric field or by simply exposing the cables to a gradient of oxygen concentration.







Abstract
Cable bacteria are multicellular, filamentous bacteria that use internal conductive fibers to transfer electrons over centimeter distances from donors within anoxic sediment layers to oxygen at the surface. We extracted the fibers and used them as free&#8208;standing bio&#8208;based electrodes to investigate their electrocatalytic behavior. The fibers catalyzed the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water, and an electric current was running through the fibers even when the potential difference was generated solely by a gradient of oxygen concentration. Oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution were confirmed by optical measurements. Within living cable bacteria, oxygen reduction by direct electrocatalysis on the fibers and not by membrane&#8208;bound proteins readily explains exceptionally high cell&#8208;specific oxygen consumption rates observed in the oxic zone, while electrocatalytic water oxidation may provide oxygen to cells in the anoxic zone.

         <title>Azonia&#8208;Naphthalene: A Cationic Hydrophilic Building Block for Stable N&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel hydrophobic building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), for n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. AN have the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability, resulting in improved ion diffusion/injection speed and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media.

&lt;p&gt;We develop a novel hydrophobic building block, 4a-azonia-naphthalene (AN), for n-type organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors. AN have the strong electron-withdrawing ability, and exhibit strong cation-&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability, resulting in improved ion diffusion/injection speed and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next-generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media. Here, we design and synthesize a novel hydrophilic polymer building block, 4a-azonia-naphthalene (AN), drawing inspiration from biological systems. Because of the strong electron-withdrawing ability of AN, the AN-based polymers show typical n-type charge transport behaviors. We find that cationic aromatics exhibit strong cation-&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability. Additionally, AN enhances the hydrophilicity and ionic-electronic coupling of the polymer, which can help to improve ion diffusion/injection speed, and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs).

         <title>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) Method for the Detection of Water Cycling across Cellular Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) method to image and quantify in vivo water cycling across cell membranes is reported. Parametric MRI&#8208;maps can be obtained that report, for each voxel, the degree of water permeability across cells. Cell membrane water permeability is a biomarker of cancer aggressiveness and can be used to monitor chemotherapy, as demonstrated in murine models of breast cancers.







Abstract
Water cycling across the membrane transporters is considered a hallmark of cellular metabolism and it could be of high diagnostic relevance in the characterization of tumors and other diseases. The method relies on the response of intracellular proton exchanging molecules to the presence of extracellular Gd&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs). Paramagnetic GBCAs enhances the relaxation rate of water molecules in the extracellular compartment and, through membrane exchange, the relaxation enhancement is transferred to intracellular molecules. The effect is detected at the MRI&#8208;CEST (Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#8208; Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) signal of intracellular proton exchanging molecules. The magnitude of the change in the CEST response reports on water cycling across the membrane. The method has been tested on Red Blood Cells and on orthotopic murine models of breast cancer with different degree of malignancy (4T1, TS/A and 168FARN). The distribution of voxels reporting on membrane permeability fits well with the cells&#8217; aggressiveness and acts as an early reporter to monitor therapeutic treatments.

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Conversion Enabled by Bimetallic Gold/Zinc Sites in Partially Reduced Gold/Zinc Oxide Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For AuZn/ZnO nanoarrays, a bimetallic synergistic effect reduces the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and accelerates electron transfer. The dual metal active sites effectively electrocatalyze CO2 and H2O conversion to syngas with a tunable syngas CO/H2 ratios from 0.25 to 2.50.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (gaseous mixture of CO and H2) is a promising way to curb excessive CO2 emission and the greenhouse gas effect. Herein, we present a bimetallic AuZn@ZnO (AuZn/ZnO) catalyst with high efficiency and durability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 66.4&#8201;% for CO and 26.5&#8201;% for H2 and 3&#8197;h stability of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The CO/H2 ratios show a wide range from 0.25 to 2.50 over a narrow potential window (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE). In situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn sites lowers the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitates electronic transfer, further highlighting the potential to control CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.

         <title>Discovery of Natural Potent HMG&#8208;CoA Reductase Degraders for Lowering Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Schisandra macrocarpa was explored for the extraction of novel compounds from its fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23. Of the indole diterpenoids and derivatives identified, biological evaluation highlighted schipenindolene A as a potent HMGCR degrader that further lowered cholesterol with statin (HMGCR inhibitor) by activating the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation pathway and inhibiting the compensatory effects of statin.







Abstract
Exploitation of key protected wild plant resources makes great sense, but their limited populations become the major barrier. A particular strategy for breaking this barrier was inspired by the exploration of a resource&#8208;saving fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23, which inhabits the key protected wild plant Schisandra macrocarpa. Chemical studies on the cultures of this strain afforded eight novel indole diterpenoids, schipenindolenes A&#8722;H (1&#8211;8), belonging to six diverse skeleton types. Importantly, semisyntheses suggested some key nonenzymatic reactions constructing these molecules and provided targeted compounds, in particular schipenindolene A (Spid&#8197;A, 1) with low natural abundance. Remarkably, Spid&#8197;A was the most potent HMG&#8208;CoA reductase (HMGCR) degrader among the indole diterpenoid family. It degraded statin&#8208;induced accumulation of HMGCR protein, decreased cholesterol levels and acted synergistically with statin to further lower cholesterol. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling suggested that Spid&#8197;A potentially activated the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to enhance the degradation of HMGCR, while simultaneously inhibiting the statin&#8208;activated expression of many key enzymes in the cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways, thereby strengthening the efficacy of statins and potentially reducing the side effects of statins. Collectively, this study suggests the potential of Spid&#8197;A for treating cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Ensembling Design of Hierarchically Ordered FAU&#8208;type Zeolite Frameworks for Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrocracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthetic ensembling design comprising methodical incision of conventional FAU&#8208;type zeolites into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments and their subsequent reorganization into hierarchically ordered zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal/3D&#8208;cubic mesopore channels. This approach eludes the kinetic constraints of conventional crystallization to produce hierarchical zeolites having excellent catalytic properties in hydrocracking applications.







Abstract
Zeolites hold importance as catalysts and membranes across numerous industrial processes that produce most of the world's fuels and chemicals. In zeolite catalysis, the rate of molecular diffusion inside the micropore channels defines the catalyst's longevity and selectivity, thereby influencing the catalytic efficiency. Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well&#8208;organized hierarchically porous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass&#8208;transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post&#8208;synthetic design for synthesizing hierarchically ordered FAU&#8208;type zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal (P6mm) and 3D&#8208;cubic (Ia
d) mesopore channels. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant&#8208;zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion&#8208;specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle&#8208;distillates in vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.

Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well-organized hierarchically porous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass-transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post-synthetic design for synthesizing hierarchically ordered FAU-type zeolites exhibiting 2D-hexagonal (&lt;i&gt;P6mm&lt;/i&gt;) and 3D-cubic (&lt;i&gt;Ia&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;) mesopore channels. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit-cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant-zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion-specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle-distillates in vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafullerane derivatives [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; (X=F&#8208;I; Y=F&#8208;I, H, Me, Et) and 
&#8208;[Cl@Si20H12Y8]&#8722; (Y=F&#8208;I) is presented. First, we evaluated the structure&#8208;determining template effect of Cl&#8722; in a systematic series of concave silapolyquinane model systems. Second, we investigated the X&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction energy (
) as a function of X&#8722; and Y and found the largest 
 values for electron&#8208;withdrawing exohedral substituents&#8197;Y. Given that X&#8722; ions can be considered as Lewis bases and empty Si20Y20 clusters as Lewis acids, we classify our inseparable host&#8211;guest complexes [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;. Third, 35Cl NMR spectroscopy proved to be highly diagnostic for an experimental assessment of the Cl&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction as the paramagnetic shielding and, in turn, 
(35Cl) of the endohedral Cl&#8722; ion correlate inversely with 
. Finally, we disclose the synthesis of [PPN][Cl@Si20Y20] (Y=Me, Et, Br) and provide a thorough characterization of these new silafulleranes.

         <title>Werner Salt as Nickel and Ammonia Source for Photochemical Synthesis of Primary Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Werner salt [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts, solving the problem of easy deactivation and difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts.







Abstract
Cheap, stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Werner ammine salts have been known for more than a century; but they have been rarely used in organic synthesis. Herein, we report that the Werner hexammine complex [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts. More than 80&#8197;aryl chlorides, including more than 20 drug molecules, were aminated, demonstrating the practicality and generality of this method in synthetic chemistry. A slow NH3 release mechanism is in operation, obviating the problem of catalyst poisoning. Still interestingly, we show that the Werner salt can be easily recovered and reused, solving the problem of difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts. The protocol thus provides an efficient new strategy for the synthesis of primary aryl amines.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly&#8212;Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>

         <dc:description>
T&#8208;shaped polyphiles self&#8208;assemble into a liquid quasicrystal and a series of liquid&#8208;crystalline periodic approximants, all representing polygonal honeycombs formed by the stacking of p&#8208;terphenyls. Featuring giant octagonal motifs containing non&#8208;regular trapezoidal or pentagonal with regular triangular and square tiles, the phases assume a transition of motif orientation, triggered by the changing conformation and entropy of the alkyl end chains.







Abstract
Quasiperiodic patterns and crystals&#8212;having long range order without translational symmetry&#8212;have fascinated researchers since their discovery. In this study, we report on new p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles with two alkyl end chains and a glycerol&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded side group that self&#8208;assemble into an aperiodic columnar liquid quasicrystal with 12&#8208;fold symmetry and its periodic liquid&#8208;crystalline approximants with complex superstructures. All represent honeycombs formed by the self&#8208;assembly of the p&#8208;terphenyls, dividing space into prismatic cells with polygonal cross&#8208;sections. In the perspective of tiling patterns, the presence of unique trapezoidal tiles, consisting of three rigid sides formed by the p&#8208;terphenyls and one shorter, incommensurate, and adjustable side by the alkyl end chains, plays a crucial role for these phases. A delicate temperature&#8208;dependent balance between conformational, entropic and space&#8208;filling effects determines the role of the alkyl chains, either as network nodes or trapezoid walls, thus resulting in the order&#8208;disorder transitions associated with emergence of quasiperiodicity. In&#8208;depth analysis suggests a change from a quasiperiodic tiling involving trapezoids to a modified one with a contribution of trapezoid pair fusion. This work paves the way for understanding quasiperiodicity emergence and develops fundamental concepts for its generation by chemical design of non&#8208;spherical molecules, aggregates, and frameworks based on dynamic reticular chemistry.

         <title>Shearing Liquid&#8208;Crystalline MXene into Lamellar Membranes with Super&#8208;Aligned Nanochannels for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned nanochannels by applying shear forces to liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene nanosheet dispersion. The as&#8208;prepared LC MXene membrane (LCMM) shows excellent in&#8208;plane stacking order and precise interlayer spacing of &#8776;6&#8197;&#197;, demonstrating ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59, respectively), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned slit&#8208;shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly&#8208;ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ separation (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59), combined with a fast Li+ transport with a permeation rate of &#8776;0.35&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li+ with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li+ and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li+ through the super&#8208;aligned MXene channels.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a two-dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super-aligned nanochannels by applying shear forces to liquid-crystalline (LC) MXene nanosheet dispersion. The as-prepared LC MXene membrane (LCMM) shows excellent in-plane stacking order and precise interlayer spacing of &#8776;6&#8197;&#197;, demonstrating ultrahigh selectivities toward Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59, respectively), outperforming the state-of-the-art membranes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion-selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two-dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super-aligned slit-shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid-crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly-ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; separation (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59), combined with a fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport with a permeation rate of &#8776;0.35&#8197;mol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming the state-of-the-art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through the super-aligned MXene channels. This work demonstrates the capability of MXene membranes in monovalent ion separation, which also provides a facile and general strategy to fabricate lamellar membranes in a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Exchange in 3D Cell Culture Hydrogels Based on Crosslinking of Cyclic Thiosulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic thiosulfinates can generate disulfide&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent hydrogels without additional stimuli to gain control over stress relaxation based on thiol content and mode of crosslinker application. Pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes can be 3D cultured in hydrogels containing macromonomers with this chemistry, displaying native behaviours, such as cell spreading and spontaneous beating.







Abstract
Dynamic polymer materials are highly valued substrates for 3D cell culture due to their viscoelasticity, a time&#8208;dependent mechanical property that can be tuned to resemble the energy dissipation of native tissues. Herein, we report the coupling of a cyclic thiosulfinate, mono&#8208;S&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;methyl asparagusic acid, to a 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;OH to prepare a disulfide&#8208;based dynamic covalent hydrogel with the addition of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;thiol. Ring opening of the cyclic thiosulfinate by nucleophilic substitution results in the rapid formation of a network showing a viscoelastic fluid&#8208;like behaviour and relaxation rates modulated by thiol content through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange, whereas its viscoelastic behaviour upon application as a small molecule linear crosslinker is solid&#8208;like. Further introduction of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;vinylsulfone in the network yields a hydrogel with weeks&#8208;long cell culture stability, permitting 3D culture of cell types that lack robust proliferation, such as human pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC&#8208;CMs). These cells display native behaviours such as cell elongation and spontaneous beating as a function of the hydrogel's mechanical properties. We demonstrate that the mode of dynamic cyclic thiosulfinate crosslinker presentation within the network can result in different stress relaxation profiles, opening the door to model tissues with disparate mechanics in 3D cell culture.

         <title>Reversal of Regioselectivity in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Bond Annulation with Bromoalkynes under Cobalt Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization of phosphinamides with haloalkynes with excellent enantioinduction and inverse regioselectivity. In a single step, the approach provides access to several P&#8208;chiral molecules. Based on control experiments and preliminary study, a plausible mechanism is provided.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond annulation strategy offers a versatile platform, allowing the construction of complex P&#8208;chiral molecules through atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical fashion. However, regioselective insertion of &#960;&#8208;coupling partner between M&#8722;C bond with high enantio&#8208;induction remain elusive. Using commercially available Co(II) salt and chiral&#8208;Salox ligands, we demonstrate an unusual protocol for the regio&#8208;reversal, enantioselective C&#8722;H bond annulation of phosphinamide with bromoalkyne through desymmetrization. The reaction proceeds through ligand&#8208;assisted enantiodetermining cyclocobaltation followed by regioselective insertion of bromoalkyne between Co&#8722;C, subsequent reductive elimination, and halogen exchange with carboxylate resulted in P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent ee (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). The isolation of cobaltacycle involved in the catalytic cycle and the outcome of control experiments provide support for a plausible mechanism.

         <title>Zr&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as nanoreactor for boosting the formation of hydrogen clathrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;assisted PCN&#8208;222 nanocrystals has been successfully used as nanoreactors to promote the nucleation and growth of hydrogen clathrates. This research shows that hydrogen can be enclathrated at lower pressure than the bulk system, with fast kinetics and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion.







Abstract
We report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of hydrogen clathrates under mild pressure and temperature conditions within the cavities of a zirconium&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework, specifically PCN&#8208;222. PCN&#8208;222 has been selected for its 1D mesoporous channels, high water&#8208;stability, and proper hydrophilic behavior. Firstly, we optimize a microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted method for the synthesis of nanosized PCN&#8208;222 particles with precise structure control (exceptional homogeneity in morphology and crystalline phase purity), taking advantage of MW in terms of rapid/homogeneous heating, time and energy savings, as well as potential scalability of the synthetic method. Second, we explore the relevance of the large mesoporous 1D open channels within the PCN&#8208;222 to promote the nucleation and growth of confined hydrogen clathrates. Experimental results show that PCN&#8208;222 drives the nucleation process at a lower pressure than the bulk system (1.35&#8197;kbar vs 2&#8197;kbar), with fast kinetics (minutes), using pure water, and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion. Unfortunately, PCN&#8208;222 cannot withstand these high pressures, which lead to a significant alteration of the mesoporous structure while the microporous network remains mainly unchanged.

         <title>A Systematic Investigation of Proteoforms with N&#8208;Terminal Glycine and Their Dynamics Reveals Its Impacts on Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method based on sortase A catalyzed ligation was developed to characterize proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine in human cells and quantify their dynamics. Around 2000 proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were identified, and most of them were previously unknown. Bioinformatic analyses reveal proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations.







Abstract
The N&#8208;termini of proteins can regulate their degradation, and the same protein with different N&#8208;termini may have distinct dynamics. Recently, it was found that N&#8208;terminal glycine can serve as a degron recognized by two E3 ligases, but N&#8208;terminal glycine was also reported to stabilize proteins. Here we developed a chemoenzymatic method for selective enrichment of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine and integrated dual protease cleavage to further improve the enrichment specificity. Over 2000 unique peptides with protein N&#8208;terminal glycine were analyzed from &gt;1000 proteins, and most of them are previously unknown, indicating the effectiveness of the current method to capture low&#8208;abundance proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine. The degradation rates of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were quantified along with those of proteins from the whole proteome. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations. Membrane proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine and proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine from the N&#8208;terminal methionine excision degrade more rapidly. Furthermore, the secondary structures, adjacent amino acid residues, and protease specificities for N&#8208;terminal glycine are also vital for protein degradation. The results advance our understanding of the effects of N&#8208;terminal glycine on protein properties and functions.

Furthermore, the secondary structures, adjacent amino acid residues, and protease specificities for N-terminal glycine are also vital for protein degradation. The results advance our understanding of the effects of N-terminal glycine on protein properties and functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H Monoalkylation of Symmetric Polyols in the Presence of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient carbonation of polyols under a CO2 atmosphere enables their C&#8722;H monoalkylation by photoredox catalysis. This reactivity results from an unprecedented C&#8722;H activation through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Achieving the selective modification of symmetric poly&#8208;hydroxylated compounds presents a significant challenge due to the presence of identical active sites. Herein, we address this challenge through the design of a ternary catalytic system that includes a photoredox catalyst, a hydrogen atom transfer promotor and a carbonation catalyst. This catalytic system enables the reversible carbonation of acyclic polyols under CO2 atmosphere, which modulates the reactivity of its distinct C&#8722;H bonds toward hydrogen atom transfers. An exquisite selectivity for the monoalkylation is achieved in a variety of unprotected light polyols, yielding valuable building blocks in short reaction times. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrate that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the transient carbonate and the free alcohol is pivotal for the kinetic and thermodynamic activation of a specific alcohol.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Helical Covalent Inorganic Polymer: Preparation, Crystal Structure and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer (CityU&#8208;10) has been successfully prepared. Its crystal structure shows that the same&#8208;handed helical chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Then, the left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure.







Abstract
Helical morphologies are widely observed in nature, however, it is very challenging to prepare artificial helical polymers. Especially, precisely understanding the structure information of artificial metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymers via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis is rarely explored. Here, we successfully prepare a novel metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer ({[Te(C6H5)2] [PO3(OH)]}n, named CityU&#8208;10) by introducing angular anions (HOPO32&#8722;) into traditional tellurium&#8208;oxygen chains. The dynamic reversibility of the reaction is realized through the introduction of organic tellurium precursor and the slow hydrolysis of polyphosphoric acid. High&#8208;quality and large&#8208;size single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 have been successfully characterized via SCXRD, where the same&#8208;handed helical inorganic polymer chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together through weak hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure. The single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 are found to display promising optical properties with a large birefringence. Our results would offer new guidelines for designing and preparing new crystalline covalent polymers through tellurium&#8208;based chemistry.

         <title>Probing Degradation in Lithium Ion Batteries with On&#8208;Chip Electrochemistry Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In batteries, the formation of gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene accompanies degradation. Ultrasensitive on chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry reveals previously undetectable gas evolution in lithium ion batteries. The ensuing insight will enable battery scientists to predict degradation mechanisms and discover new strategies to stabilise device performance.







Abstract
The rapid uptake of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale electric vehicle and energy storage applications requires a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Capacity fade is due to the complex interplay between phase transitions, electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution; many of these poorly understood parasitic reactions evolve gases as a side product. Here we present an on&#8208;chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry method that enables ultra&#8208;sensitive, fully quantified and time resolved detection of volatile species evolving from an operating LIB. The technique's electrochemical performance and mass transport is described by a finite element model and then experimentally used to demonstrate the variety of new insights into LIB performance. We show the versatility of the technique, including (a) observation of oxygen evolving from a LiNiMnCoO2 cathode and (b) the solid electrolyte interphase formation reaction on graphite in a variety of electrolytes, enabling the deconvolution of lithium inventory loss (c) the first direct evidence, by virtue of the improved time resolution of our technique, that carbon dioxide reduction to ethylene takes place in a lithium ion battery. The emerging insight will guide and validate battery lifetime models, as well as inform the design of longer lasting batteries.

         <title>Counterion Effect in Cobaltate&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The counterion makes a difference in alkene hydrogenations promoted by low&#8208;valence cobaltate salts. The best performing catalyst cleanly hydrogenated various alkenes (including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies point toward a homotopic catalyst and show how counterion coordination to hydride intermediates modulates the barrier for the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion.







Abstract
We show that countercations exert a remarkable influence on the ability of anionic cobaltate salts to catalyze challenging alkene hydrogenations. An evaluation of the catalytic properties of [Cat][Co(&#951;4&#8208;cod)2] (Cat=K (1), Na (2), Li (3), (Depnacnac)Mg (4), and N(nBu)4 (5); cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, Depnacnac={2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3NC(CH3)}2CH)]) demonstrated that the lithium salt 3 and magnesium salt 4 drastically outperform the other catalysts. Complex 4 was the most active catalyst, which readily promotes the hydrogenation of highly congested alkenes under mild conditions. A plausible catalytic mechanism is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Furthermore, combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and DFT studies were used to examine the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion step. The results of these studies suggest an active co&#8208;catalytic role of the counterion in the hydrogenation reaction through the coordination to cobalt hydride intermediates.

         <title>Precise Methylation Yields Acceptor with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network for High&#8208;Efficiency and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed four small&#8208;molecule acceptors (Qo1, Qo2, Qo3 and Qo4) by incorporating a methylation strategy. Solar cells fabricated with polymer donor PM6 and Qo2 realized the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%).

Utilizing intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions stands for an effective approach in advancing the efficiency and stability of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) for polymer solar cells. Herein, we synthesized three SMAs (Qo1, Qo2, and Qo3) using indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoxalin&#8208;11&#8208;one (Qox) as the electron&#8208;deficient group, with the incorporation of a methylation strategy. Through crystallographic analysis, it is observed that two Qox&#8208;based methylated acceptors (Qo2 and Qo3) exhibit multiple hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted 3D network transport structures, in contrast to the 2D transport structure observed in gem&#8208;dichlorinated counterpart (Qo4). Notably, Qo2 exhibits multiple and stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions compared with Qo3. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device realizes the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%). This remarkable PCE in PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility, more favorable medium structure, and more efficient charge transfer and collection behavior. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#8201;&#176;C for 250&#8197;hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SMAs.

         <title>Anion Sensing through Redox&#8208;Modulated Fluorescent Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding Hosts
</title>

         <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemical anion sensing is introduced as a powerful method to enable anion detection via simultaneous emission and voltammetry readouts. The combined advantages of both approaches facilitate anion sensing at very low sensor concentrations and in a competitive solvent system using a redox&#8208;active ferrocene&#8208;containing BODIPY anion receptor, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PET) modulates fluorescence emission.







Abstract
Anion sensing via either optical or electrochemical readouts has separately received enormous attention, however, a judicious combination of the advantages of both modalities remains unexplored. Toward this goal, we herein disclose a series of novel, redox&#8208;active, fluorescent, halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) BODIPY&#8208;based anion sensors, wherein the introduction of a ferrocene motif induces remarkable changes in the fluorescence response. Extensive fluorescence anion titration, lifetime and electrochemical studies reveal anion binding&#8208;induced emission modulation through intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the magnitude of which is dependent on the nature of both the XB/HB donor and anion. Impressively, the XB sensor outperformed its HB congener in terms of anion binding strength and fluorescence switching magnitude, displaying significant fluorescence turn&#8208;OFF upon anion binding. In contrast, redox&#8208;inactive control receptors display a turn&#8208;ON response, highlighting the pronounced impact of the introduction of the redox&#8208;active ferrocene on the optical sensing performance. Additionally, the redox&#8208;active ferrocene motif also serves as an electrochemical reporter group, enabling voltammetric anion sensing in competitive solvents. The combined advantages of both sensing modalities were further exploited in a novel, proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, fluorescence spectroelectrochemical anion sensing approach, enabling simultaneous and sensitive read out of optical and electrochemical responses in multiple oxidation states and at very low receptor concentration.

         <title>Ammonolysis of Glyoxal at the Air&#8208;Water Nanodroplet Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine occurs at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface with the stepwise pathways facilitated by the water dimers, which is highly feasible and plays a pivotal role in removing glyoxal.







Abstract
The reactions of glyoxal (CHO)2) with amines in cloud processes contribute to the formation of brown carbon and oligomer particles in the atmosphere. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the ammonolysis mechanisms of glyoxal with amines at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface. We identified three and two distinct pathways for the ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine by using metadynamics simulations at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface, respectively. Notably, the stepwise pathways mediated by the water dimer for the reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine display the lowest free energy barriers of 3.6 and 4.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. These results showed that the air&#8208;water nanodroplet ammonolysis reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine were more feasible and occurred at faster rates than the corresponding gas phase ammonolysis, the OH+(CHO)2 reaction, and the aqueous phase reaction of glyoxal, leading to the dominant removal of glyoxal. Our results provide new and important insight into the reactions between carbonyl compounds and amines, which are crucial in forming nitrogen&#8208;containing aerosol particles.

         <title>Assembly of Luminescent Chiral Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Clusters via Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full potential of the chiral self&#8208;sorting in gold(I)&#8208;sulfido cluster system has been explored for the first time. Different combinations of axial chiral ligands give rise to distinct chiral gold(I)&#8208;sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.







Abstract
Due to the ubiquity of chirality in nature, chiral self&#8208;assembly involving self&#8208;sorting behaviors has remained as one of the most important research topics of interests. Herein, starting from a racemic mixture of SEG&#8208;based (SEG=SEGPHOS) chlorogold(I) precursors, a unique chiral butterfly&#8208;shape hexadecanuclear gold(I) cluster (Au16) with different ratios of RSEG and SSEG ligands is obtained via homoleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting. More interestingly, by employing different chlorogold(I) precursors of opposite chirality (such as RSEG&#8208;Au2 and SBIN&#8208;Au2 (BIN=BINAP)), an unprecedented heteroleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting strategy has been developed to give a series of heteroleptic chiral decanuclear gold(I) clusters (Au10) with propellor&#8208;shape structures. Heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting have also been observed between enantiomers of homoleptic chiral Au10 clusters to result in the heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters via cluster&#8208;to&#8208;cluster transformation. Incorporation of heteroleptic ligands is found to decrease the symmetry from S4 of homoleptic meso Au10 to C2 of heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters. The chirality has been transferred from the axial chiral ligands and stored in the heteroleptic gold(I) clusters.

         <title>Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intersection of surfactant partitioning, spontaneous emulsification, and substrate wettability generates a unique type of motion&#8212;droplet oscillation&#8212;rarely reported in the literature for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion systems. The effect of varying the concentration of the surfactant, substrate properties, and the chemical nature of the oil and surfactant on the oscillating droplets was studied.







Abstract
The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self&#8208;powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side&#8208;view optical microscopy.

     alt="Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil-in-Water Emulsion Droplets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of surfactant partitioning, spontaneous emulsification, and substrate wettability generates a unique type of motion&#8212;droplet oscillation&#8212;rarely reported in the literature for oil-in-water emulsion systems. The effect of varying the concentration of the surfactant, substrate properties, and the chemical nature of the oil and surfactant on the oscillating droplets was studied.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self-powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non-equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil-in-water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side-view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self-emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact-line. The ability to control and understand droplet oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out-of-equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab-on-a-chip and adaptive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diluting the Resistance of Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x for Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover in Alkaline Seawater Splitting</title>

The oxygen vacancy dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field of Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to accelerate the hydrogen transfer step in hydrogen spillover, improving hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
Recently, hydrogen spillover based binary (HSBB) catalysts have received widespread attention due to the sufficiently utilized reaction sites. However, the specific regulation mechanism of spillover intensity is still unclear. Herein, we have fabricated oxygen vacancies enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to investigate the internal relationship between electron supply and mechanism of hydrogen spillover enhancement. The DFT calculations cooperate with in situ Raman spectrum to uncover that the H* spillover from NiMoO4&#8208;x to Ru. Meanwhile, oxygen vacancies weakened the electron supply from Ru to NiMoO4&#8208;x, which contributes to dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) for hydrogen spillover. In addition, the higher ion concentration in electrolyte will promote the H* adsorption step obviously, which is demonstrated by in situ EIS tests. As a result, the Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x exhibits a low overpotential of 206&#8197;mV at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 28.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and an excellent durability of 550&#8197;h at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#8197;M KOH seawater.

         <title>Triggering Dual Two&#8208;electron Pathway for H2O2 Generation by Multiple [Bi&#8722;O]n Interlayers in Ultrathin Bi12O17Cl2 towards Efficient Piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst was prepared with peculiar [Bi3O4.25] layers. The existence of [Bi3O4.25] not only serves as active sites but also satisfies energy band structure for 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR, realizing the dual pathway for adequate H2O2 synthesis. Expectedly, the constructed Bi12O17Cl2&#8208;PESF emerges superior degradation activity for pollutants attributed to sufficient use of in situ produced H2O2 to abundant &#8901;OH.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system (PESF) has been emerging as a promising water treatment technology but suffering from unsatisfied H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we rationally design a Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst with multiple [Bi&#8722;O]n interlayers towards highly efficient H2O2 production. The introduction of [Bi3O4.25] layers initiates dual two&#8208;electron pathway for H2O2 generation by altering the interlayer properties. It is found that the additional [Bi3O4.25] layers not only enhance the polarization electric field but also serve as active sites for triggering dual pathways of two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reaction for H2O2 production. Therefore, the Bi12O17Cl2 exhibits an ultrahigh rate of H2O2 generation (7.76&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) in pure water. Based on the adequate H2O2 yield, a PESF was constructed for acetaminophen (ACE) degradation with an apparent rate constant of 0.023&#8197;min&#8722;1. This work not only presents a potential strategy of tuning the activity of bismuth based piezo&#8208;catalysts but also provides a good example on the construction of highly efficient PESF for environmental remediation by using natural mechanical energy.

         <title>Stereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new look at catalytic Wittig&#8208;type olefinations. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials leading to the development of a highly E&#8208;selective copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners.







Abstract
Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig&#8208;type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig&#8208;type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E&#8208;selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti&#8208;elimination.

         <title>Direct Analysis of Complex Reaction Mixtures: Formose Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Online monitoring of formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry reveals the growth of the size and complexity of sugar molecules. Chemometrics analysis identified the key reaction mixture components and their contribution to the dynamic reaction changes. The results allowed the reconstruction of the reaction networks and analysis of the kinetics of early steps of formose reaction.







Abstract
Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non&#8208;negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion&#8208;signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised &#8776;300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar&#8208;calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro&#8208;aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar&#8208;backbone branching for C6&#8197;sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C5&#8197;sugars. This top&#8208;down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.

     alt="Direct Analysis of Complex Reaction Mixtures: Formose Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online monitoring of formose reaction by ion-mobility-separation mass-spectrometry reveals the growth of the size and complexity of sugar molecules. Chemometrics analysis identified the key reaction mixture components and their contribution to the dynamic reaction changes. The results allowed the reconstruction of the reaction networks and analysis of the kinetics of early steps of formose reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the formose reaction by ion-mobility-separation mass-spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non-negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion-signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised &#8776;300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar-calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro-aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar-backbone branching for C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;sugars. This top-down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A versatile chiral amide directing group has been studied in the context of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Six transformations have been achieved, affording a series of valuable chiral products. With this tool, concise syntheses of many natural products and biologically active compounds (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol) were accomplished.







Abstract
A versatile and readily available chiral amide directing group has been developed for the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of the related chiral benzamides with various olefins, aldehydes and propargylic alcohols has been accomplished with high stereoselectivities, affording a series of chiral products including 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee), isocoumarins (up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;ee), phthalides (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee), chiral bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr), 4&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and allenes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Importantly, our methodologies enabled concise syntheses of many biologically active compounds and natural products (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol).

         <title>Manipulated Fluoro&#8208;Ether Derived Nucleophilic Decomposition Products for Mitigating Polarization&#8208;Induced Capacity Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior crosslinked products derived from HFE decomposition via nucleophilic O species attack serve as valuable sutures. They prevent fragmented substances from escaping CEI construction, providing an excellent foundation for the homogeneous deposition of LiF related species. Consequently, an effective CEI with both rigidity and flexibility is established, which reduces cell polarization, achieves long&#8208;lasting electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is a fascinating choice to improve the performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes (LRLO) for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, many existing electrolyte designs and adjustment principles tend to overlook the unique challenges posed by LRLO, particularly the nucleophilic attack. Here, we introduce an electrolyte modification by locally replacing carbonate solvents in traditional electrolytes with a fluoro&#8208;ether. By benefit of the decomposition of fluoro&#8208;ether under nucleophilic O&#8208;related attacks, which delivers an excellent passivation layer with LiF and polymers, possessing rigidity and flexibility on the LRLO surface. More importantly, the fluoro&#8208;ether acts as &#8220;sutures&#8221;, ensuring the integrity and stability of both interfacial and bulk structures, which contributed to suppressing severe polarization and enhancing the cycling capacity retention from 39&#8201;% to 78&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles for the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class LRLO. This key electrolyte strategy with comprehensive analysis, provides new insights into addressing nucleophilic challenge for high&#8208;energy anionic redox related cathode systems.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Isolated Atomically Dispersed Nanocatalysts for Self&#8208;Motivated Cocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;isolated mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) with ligand&#8208;field&#8208;effect&#8208;promoted cocatalytic Fenton catalysis have been constructed. The catechols from dopamine serve as both an iron coordination site for atomic isolation and a reductive ligand to generate a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs, thereby promoting in vivo Fenton catalytic effects against tumors.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic tumor therapy based on Fenton nanocatalysts has attracted considerable attention because of its therapeutic specificity, enhanced outcomes, and high biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the rate&#8208;determining step in Fenton chemistry, which involves the transition of a high&#8208;valence metallic center (FeIII) to a Fenton&#8208;active low&#8208;valence metallic center (FeII), has hindered advances in nanocatalyst&#8208;based therapeutics. In this study, we constructed mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) by employing catechols from dopamine to coordinate and isolate single iron atoms. The catechols also serve as reductive ligands, generating a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs. This self&#8208;motivated cocatalytic strategy enabled by mSAFe NCs accelerates the kinetics of the Fenton catalytic reaction, resulting in remarkable performance for nanocatalytic tumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly for Control over Helical Nanostructures and Topochemical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular assemblies from a rationally designed glutamide derivative were found, which formed distinct chiral nanotwist and nanotube depending on the cooling rate. Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly showed also the ability to control over the guest molecules with emergent blue or green circularly polarized luminescence and topochemical polymerization.







Abstract
Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly, in which a single building block forms two or more types of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures, is an important topic due to its mimic to the complexity in biology and manipulation of diverse supramolecular materials. Here, we report a pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly using chiral glutamide derivatives (L or D&#8208;PAG), which form chiral nanotwist and nanotube through a cooperative slow cooling and an isodesmic fast cooling process, respectively. Furthermore, pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly can be harnessed to control over the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of PAG with a luminophore &#946;&#8208;DCS or a photopolymerizable PCDA. Fast cooling leads to the co&#8208;assembled PAG/&#946;&#8208;DCS nanotube exhibiting green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), while slow cooling to nanofiber with blue CPL. Additionally, fast cooling process promotes the photopolymerization of PCDA into a red chiral polymer, whereas slow cooling inhibits the polymerization. This work not only demonstrates the pathway&#8208;dependent control over structural characteristics but also highlights the diverse functions emerged from the different assemblies.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Pentlandite by High&#8208;Spin State Iron for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>

The high&#8208;spin state of Fe in Fe5Ni4S8 promotes the accumulation of surface OH&#8722; and accelerates the rate of electron transfer, thereby establishing a correlation with the kinetic rate of the reconstructive reaction.







Abstract
Triggering rapid reconstruction reactions holds the potential to approach the theoretical limits of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and spin state manipulation has shown great promise in this regard. In this study, the transition of Fe spin states from low to high was successfully achieved by adjusting the surface electronic structure of pentlandite. In situ characterization and kinetic simulations confirmed that the high&#8208;spin state of Fe promoted the accumulation of OH&#8722; on the surface and accelerated electron transfer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the reconstruction reaction. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that the lower d&#8208;band center of high&#8208;spin Fe optimized the adsorption of active intermediates, thereby enhancing the reconstruction kinetics. Remarkably, pentlandites with high&#8208;spin Fe exhibited ultra&#8208;low overpotential (245&#8197;mV&#8201;@&#8201;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent stability. These findings provided new insights for the design and fabrication of highly active OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated [3+1] Fragmentation of White Phosphorus: Access to Acylcyanophosphanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be selectively activated and functionalized via low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes. Subsequent treatment of the acylated P4 ligands with cyanide induces a rare [3+1] fragmentation and yields cyanophosphanides (P1) and triphosphido cobaltate (P3). Additional experiments with neutral cyanide or isocyanide provide insight into a plausible fragmentation mechanism and allow the isolation of potential intermediates.







Abstract
Despite the accessibility of numerous transition metal polyphosphido complexes through transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated activation of white phosphorus, the targeted functionalization of Pn ligands to obtain functional monophosphorus species remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a new [3+1] fragmentation procedure for cyclo&#8208;P4 ligands, leading to the discovery of acylcyanophosphanides and &#8208;phosphines. Treatment of the complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] ([K(18c&#8208;6)]3, 18c&#8208;6=[18]crown&#8208;6, Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;isopropylphenyl, BIAN=1,2&#8208;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene diimine) with acyl chlorides results in the formation of acylated tetraphosphido complexes [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4C(O)R)] (R=tBu, Cy, 1&#8208;Ad, Ph; 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). Subsequent reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with cyanide salts yield acylated cyanophosphanides [RC(O)PCN]&#8722; (9&#8201;a&#8211;d&#8722;) and the cyclo&#8208;P3 cobaltate anion [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;3&#8208;P3)(CN)]&#8722; (8&#8722;). Further reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN) and isocyanides provide insight into a plausible mechanism of this [3+1] fragmentation reaction, as these reagents partially displace the P4C(O)R ligand from the cobalt center. Several potential intermediates of the [3+1] fragmentation were characterized. Additionally, the introduction of a second acyl substituent was achieved by treating [K(18c&#8208;6)]9b with CyC(O)Cl, resulting in the first bis(acyl)monocyanophosphine (CyC(O))2PCN (10).

         <title>Hydrated [3+2] Cyclotelomerization of Butafulvenes to Create Multiple Contiguous Fully Substituted Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes has been developed to create spiro fused tricyclic rings with a contiguous fully substituted carbon motif.







Abstract
The construction of multiple continuous fully substituted carbon centers, which serve as unique structural motif in natural products, is a challenging topic in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes to create contiguous fully substituted carbon backbone. In the presence of scandium triflate, all&#8208;carbon skeleton with spiro fused tricyclic ring can be constructed in high diastereoselectivity by utilizing butafulvene as the synthon. Mechanistic studies suggest that this atom&#8208;economic reaction probably proceeds through a synergistic process containing butafulvenes dimerization and nucleophilic attack by water. In addition, the tricyclic product can undergo a series of synthetic derivatizations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy. The recyclability of Sc(OTf)3 has also been demonstrated to show its robust performance in this hydrated cyclotelomerization.

         <title>Weak Solvation Effect Induced Optimal Interfacial Chemistry Enables Highly Durable Zn Anodes for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte with weak solvation effect is rationally developed for aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs). Benefiting from the reduced solvated H2O, boosted desolvation kinetics and in situ formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, Zn anode cycled in this electrolyte can deliver enhanced cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale&#8208;up applications, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant acetone to achieve H2O&#8208;poor solvation structure of Zn2+. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i)&#8197;relieve the solvated H2O related side reactions, ii)&#8197;suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+ and iii)&#8197;in situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30&#8197;h to more than 800&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and can work at more harsh condition of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More encouragingly, Zn/V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at &#8776;700th&#8197;cycle).

         <title>Modulation of Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap in Atomically Precise Silver Cluster&#8208;Assembled Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>

The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was modulated by controlling the inter&#8208;cluster interaction defined by the supramolecular arrangements of Ag12 nanoclusters.







Abstract
Silver cluster&#8208;based solids have garnered considerable attention owing to their tunable luminescence behavior. While surface modification has enabled the construction of stable silver clusters, controlling interactions among clusters at the molecular level has been challenging due to their tendency to aggregate. Judicious choice of stabilizing ligands becomes pivotal in crafting a desired assembly. However, detailed photophysical behavior as a function of their cluster packing remained unexplored. Here, we modulate the packing pattern of Ag12 clusters by varying the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand. CAM&#8208;1 formed through coordination of the tritopic linker molecule and NC&#8208;1 with monodentate pyridine ligand; established via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Both the assemblies show ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT) based cluster&#8208;centered emission band(s). Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra exhibit blue shifts at higher temperatures, which is attributed to the extent of the thermal reverse population of the S1 state from the closely spaced T1 state. The difference in the energy gap (&#916;EST) dictated by their assemblies played a pivotal role in the way that Ag12 cluster assembly in CAM&#8208;1 manifests a wider &#916;EST and thus requires higher temperatures for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) than assembly of NC&#8208;1. Such assembly&#8208;defined photoluminescence properties underscore the potential toolkit to design new cluster&#8208; assemblies with tailored optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Reactivity of Thorium Supported by Redox&#8208;Active Tripodal Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electrons can be stored in the arene anchor of robust tripodal siloxide frameworks by chemical reduction of their Th(IV) complexes. The two electrons become available at the metal center for the controlled two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while the ligand framework is retained in its original form.







Abstract
The high stability of the + IVoxidation state limits thorium redox reactivity. Here we report the synthesis and the redox reactivity of two Th(IV) complexes supported by the arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands [(KOSiR2Ar)3&#8208;arene)]. The two&#8208;electron reduction of these Th(IV) complexes generates the doubly reduced [KTh((OSi(OtBu)2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2] (2OtBu) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Th((OSiPh2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2](2Ph&#8208;crypt) where the formal oxidation state of Th is +II. Structural and computational studies indicate that the reduction occurred at the arene anchor of the ligand. The robust tripodal frameworks store in the arene anchor two electrons that become available at the metal center for the two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while retaining the ligand framework. This work shows that arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands allow implementation of two&#8208;electron redox chemistry at the thorium center while retaining the ligand framework unchanged.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Based Catalytic Scavengers for Concurrent Scavenging of H2S and Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S overproduction is linked to various disease states while chemical tools that can precisely downregulate H2S are still lacking. In this work, selenoxide&#8208;containing compounds were found to be potent H2S scavengers with promising antidotal effects for H2S poisoning. Several diselenides were further developed as catalytic scavengers for both H2S and H2O2.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that plays important roles in redox signaling. H2S overproduction has been linked to a variety of disease states and therefore, H2S&#8208;depleting agents, such as scavengers, are needed to understand the significance of H2S&#8208;based therapy. It is known that elevated H2S can induce oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as in H2S acute intoxication. We explored the possibility of developing catalytic scavengers to simultaneously remove H2S and ROS. Herein, we studied a series of selenium&#8208;based molecules as catalytic H2S/H2O2 scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H2S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as S6 were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma&#8208; and cell lysate&#8208;containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light&#8208;induced H2S removal. These Se&#8208;based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H2S/ROS regulations.

Crystalline dual&#8208;porous pyridine&#8208;based CTF with in situ generated Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites has been synthesized for the first time. Benefiting from the unique structure of Fe&#8208;N3 and the dynamic reversible microenvironment of metal active centers, few&#8208;layer Fe&#8208;CTF nanosheets exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic and Zn&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have gained considerable interest in energy and catalysis owing to their well&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated porosity and superior physicochemical properties, however, suffer from very limited molecular structures. Herein we report a novel solvent&#8208;free FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of 2, 6&#8208;pyridinedicarbonitrile (DCP) to achieve the first synthesis of crystalline, dual&#8208;porous, pyridine&#8208;based CTF (Fe&#8208;CTF). The FeCl3 could not only act as a highly active Lewis acid catalyst for promoting the two&#8208;dimensional ordered polymerization of DCP monomers, but also in situ coordinate with the tridentate chelators generated between pyridine and triazine groups to yield unique Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites in Fe&#8208;CTF. Abundant few&#8208;layer crystalline nanosheets (Fe&#8208;CTF NSs) could be prepared through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered Fe&#8208;CTF and exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential and onset potential up to 0.902 and 1.02&#8197;V respectively, and extraordinary Zn&#8208;air battery performance with an ultrahigh specific capacity and power density of 811&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 230&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. By combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we revealed a dynamic and reversible evolution of Fe&#8208;N3 to Fe&#8208;N2 during the electrocatalytic process, which could further accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Using Redox&#8208;Switchable Polymerization Catalysis to Synthesize a Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers containing poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) hard blocks and poly(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;co&#8208;cyclohexene oxide) soft blocks were synthesized using redox&#8208;switchable catalysis. The polymers demonstrated improved flexibility and mechanical properties similar to thermoplastic elastomers and underwent depolymerization under reactive distillation using Lewis acid catalysts, showing the material can be chemically recycled for a circular plastics economy.







Abstract
In an effort to synthesize chemically recyclable thermoplastic elastomers, a redox&#8208;switchable catalytic system was developed to synthesize triblock copolymers containing stiff poly(lactic acid) (PLA) end blocks and a flexible poly(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;co&#8208;cyclohexene oxide) (poly(THF&#8208;co&#8208;CHO) copolymer as the mid&#8208;block. The orthogonal reactivity induced by changing the oxidation state of the iron&#8208;based catalyst enabled the synthesis of the triblock copolymers in a single reaction flask from a mixture of monomers. The triblock copolymers demonstrated improved flexibility compared to poly(l&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) and thermomechanical properties that resemble thermoplastic elastomers, including a rubbery plateau in the range of &#8722;60 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. The triblock copolymers containing a higher percentage of THF versus CHO were more flexible, and a blend of triblock copolymers containing PLLA and poly(d&#8208;lactic acid) (PDLA) end&#8208;blocks resulted in a stereocomplex that further increased polymer flexibility. Besides the low cost of lactide and THF, the sustainability of this new class of triblock copolymers was also supported by their depolymerization, which was achieved by exposing the copolymers sequentially to FeCl3 and ZnCl2/PEG under reactive distillation conditions.

         <title>Binary Atomic Sites Enable a Confined Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalytic Sulfur Conversion for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated. And the catalytic matrix facilitated confined tandem electrocatalysis effects render the successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediators and mitigate the cathodic passivation within the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane architectured solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
The broader implementation of current all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries is still plagued by high operation temperature and inefficient sulfur utilization. And the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway along with the sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics further compromise the theoretical potentials of Na&#8722;S chemistry. Herein, we report a confined bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis effect to tune polysulfide electrochemistry in a novel low&#8208;temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S battery that utilizes Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane as a platform. The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated using a sacrificial template process. Upon discharge, CoN4 sites activate sulfur species and catalyze long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while MnN4 centers substantially accelerate the low&#8208;kinetic Na2S4 to Na2S directly conversion, manipulating the uniform deposition of electroactive Na2S and avoiding the formation of irreversible products (e.g., Na2S2). The intrinsic synergy of two catalytic centers benefits the Na2S decomposition and minimizes its activation barrier during battery recharging and then efficiently mitigate the cathodic passivation. As a result, the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cell delivers an attractive reversible capacity of 1060&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high CE of 98.5&#8201;% and a high energy of 1008&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode&#8722;1, comparable to the liquid electrolyte cells.

         <title>A Breast Cancer Stem Active Cobalt(III)&#8208;Cyclam Complex Containing Flufenamic Acid with Immunogenic Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first investigation into the cytotoxic and immunogenic potential of a cobalt complex within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt complex is able to deliver flufenamic acid to CSCs, which perturbs the inhibitory damage&#8208;associated molecular pattern axis and promotes immunogenic cell death. This subsequently leads to the phagocytosis of CSCs by macrophages.







Abstract
The cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating properties of a cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex bearing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, flufenamic acid is reported within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 displays sub&#8208;micromolar potency towards breast CSCs grown in monolayers, 24&#8208;fold and 31&#8208;fold greater than salinomycin (an established anti&#8208;breast CSC agent) and cisplatin (an anticancer metallopharmaceutical), respectively. Strikingly, the cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 is 69&#8208;fold and 50&#8208;fold more potent than salinomycin and cisplatin towards three&#8208;dimensionally cultured breast CSC mammospheres. Mechanistic studies reveal that 1 induces DNA damage, inhibits cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 expression, and prompts caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Breast CSCs treated with 1 exhibit damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns characteristic of immunogenic cell death and are phagocytosed by macrophages. As far as we are aware, 1 is the first cobalt complex of any oxidation state or geometry to display both cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating effects on breast CSCs.

         <title>Adjusting the Architecture of Heptagonal Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles by Embedding Metal Nodes into the Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two giant metallo&#8208;macrocycles with double&#8208;layer and triple&#8208;layer concentric heptagonal structures (DA and TA, respectively) have been successfully assembled by embedding coordination sites in the ligand backbone. The angle between the two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) units increased after complexation with metal ions, leading to precise control over the topology.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been extensively employed for the bottom&#8208;up construction of discrete metallo&#8208;macrocycles. However, the prevalent use of benzene rings as the backbone limits the formation of large metallo&#8208;macrocycles with more than six edges. Herein, by embedding metal nodes into the ligand backbone, we successfully regulated the ligand arm angle and assembled two giant heptagonal metallo&#8208;macrocycles with precise control. The angle between two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) extended after complexation with metal ions, leading to ring expansion of the metallo&#8208;macrocycle. The assembled structures were straightforwardly identified through multi&#8208;dimensional NMR spectroscopy (1H, COSY, NOESY), multidimensional mass spectrometry analysis (ESI&#8208;MS and TWIM&#8208;MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In addition, the catalytic performances of metallo&#8208;macrocycles in the oxidation of thioanisole were studied, with both supramolecules exhibiting good conversion rates. Furthermore, fiber&#8208;like nanostructures were observed from single&#8208;molecule heptagons by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly.

A series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks [PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx), x=3, 5, 7, 11] are rationally fabricated through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, which showed excellent performance in catalyzing the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component tandem reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the facile preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones.







Abstract
The non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysed&#8208;multicomponent reactions between flue gas CO2 and cheap industrial raw stocks into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals is a promising manner for the ideal CO2 utilization route. To achieve this, the key fundamental challenge is the rational development of highly efficient and facile reaction pathway while establishing compatible catalytic system. Herein, through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, we report the construction of a series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx) [BPY=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate, TPDC&#8208;NH2=2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid] that can catalyze the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Such assembly endows the MOFs with superhydrophobic microenvironment, superior water resistance and highly stable catalytic site, leading to 21 times higher turnover numbers than that of homogeneous counterparts. Mechanism investigation implied that the substrates can be efficiently enriched by the MOF wall and then the adsorbed amine species act as an extrinsic binding site towards dilute CO2 through their strong preferential formation to carbamate acid. Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggest the tetrahedral geometry of Cu in MOF offers special resistance towards amine poisoning, thus maintaining its high efficiency during the catalytic process.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Self&#8208;Relaxation of Asymmetric Coordination in Fe&#8208;Based Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implemented an asymmetric coordination Fe&#8722;S1N3 SAC with significant geometric distortion. The Fe&#8722;S1N3 sites demonstrate distinctive self&#8208;relaxation behavior in response to different adsorption intermediates during the CO2RR process. The dynamic change in bond length enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediates adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity.







Abstract
Addressing the limitations arising from the consistent catalytic behavior observed for various intermediates during the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses a significant challenge in the optimization of catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by constructing an asymmetric coordination Fe single atom catalyst (SCA) with a dynamically evolved structure. Our catalyst, consisting of a Fe atom coordinated with one S atom and three N atoms (Fe&#8722;S1N3), exhibited exceptional selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02&#8201;%) and demonstrated a high intrinsic activity (TOF of 7804.34&#8197;h&#8722;1), and remarkable stability. Using operando XAFS spectra and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the self&#8208;relaxation of geometric distortion and dynamic evolution of bond lengths within the catalyst. These structure changes enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediate adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CO2RR. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of SACs and paves the way for targeted catalyst designs aimed to disrupt the linear scaling relationships.

         <title>Friedel&#8211;Crafts Acylation for Accessing Multi&#8208;Bridge&#8208;Functionalized Large Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different lateral functionalized pillar[n]arenes can be obtained using Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation. The irreversible nature of acylation results in the macrocycles being obtained selectively in terms of ring sizes and functional positions. Further derivatization of the ketones is also possible to afford various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes that cannot be accessed by general Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes can be constructed using a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation process. However, due to the reversible nature of the alkylation, mixture of large pillar[n]arenes (n&#8805;7) are obtained as minor products, and thus laborious purification are necessary to isolate the larger pillar[n]arenes. Moreover, inert methylene bridges are introduced during the alkylation process, and the multi&#8208;functionalization of the bridges has never been investigated. Herein, an irreversible Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation is used to prepare pillar[n]arenes. Due to the irreversible nature of the acylation, the reaction of precursors bearing carboxylic acids and electron&#8208;rich arene rings results in a size&#8208;exclusive formation of pillar[n]arenes, in which the ring&#8208;size is determined by the precursor length. Because of this size&#8208;selective formation, laborious separation of undesired macrocycles is not necessary. Moreover, the bridges of pillar[n]arenes are selectively installed with reactive carbonyl groups using the acylation method, whose positions are determined by the precursor used. The carbonyl bridges can be easily converted into versatile functional groups, leading to various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes, which cannot be accessed by the alkylation strategy.

         <title>The Diterpenoid Substrate Analogue 19&#8208;nor&#8208;GGPP Reveals Pronounced Methyl Group Effects in Diterpene Cyclisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
19&#8208;nor&#8208;Geranylgeranyldiphosphate (with a methyl group removed) has been synthesised and converted into diterpene analogues with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases. In some cases only the desmethyl derivatives of the natural enzyme products were obtained, but with several enzymes a dramatic change in the reactivity was observed. The newly opened reaction paths to compounds with unknown skeletons reveal an intriguing methyl group effect in diterpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
The substrate analogue 19&#8208;nor&#8208;geranylgeranyl diphosphate (19&#8208;nor&#8208;GGPP) was synthesised and incubated with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases, resulting in the formation of diterpenoids in all cases. A total of 23&#8197;different compounds were isolated from these enzyme reactions and structurally characterised, if possible including the experimental determination of absolute configurations through a stereoselective deuteration approach. In several cases the missing 19&#8208;Me group in the substrate analogue resulted in opening of completely new reaction paths towards compounds with novel skeletons. DFT calculations were applied to gain a deeper understanding of these observed methyl group effects in diterpene biosynthesis.

         <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Mechanism in Aqueous Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpointed the cause of the capacity degradation of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries and established the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. Such a methodology circumvents the complicated characterization methods used in previous studies and provides a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of other aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries have attracted extensive attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications, however, the energy storage chemistry of MnO2 in mild acidic aqueous electrolytes remains elusive and controversial. Using &#945;&#8208;MnO2 as a case study, we developed a methodology by coupling conventional coin batteries with customized beaker batteries to pinpoint the operating mechanism of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries. This approach visually simulates the operating state of batteries in different scenarios and allows for a comprehensive study of the operating mechanism of aqueous Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries under mild acidic conditions. It is validated that the electrochemical performance can be modulated by controlling the addition of Mn2+ to the electrolyte. The method is utilized to systematically eliminate the possibility of Zn2+ and/or H+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation reactions, thereby confirming the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. By combining a series of phase and spectroscopic characterizations, the compositional, morphological and structural evolution of electrodes and electrolytes during battery cycling is probed, elucidating the intrinsic battery chemistry of MnO2 in mild acid electrolytes. Such a methodology developed can be extended to other energy storage systems, providing a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries as well.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Live Imaging of Osteoclast Activation via Cathepsin K Activity in Bone Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe, CatKP1, has been developed to detect cathepsin K and enable the real&#8208;time monitoring of osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones during pathologic bone loss. This highlights the importance of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for studying aberrant osteoclast behavior and exploring new therapeutic strategies.







Abstract
Intravital fluorescence imaging of functional osteoclasts within their intact disease context provides valuable insights into the intricate biology at the microscopic level, facilitating the development of therapeutic approaches for osteoclast&#8208;associated bone diseases. However, there is a lack of studies investigating osteoclast activity within deep&#8208;seated bone lesions using appropriate fluorescent probes, despite the advantages offered by the multi&#8208;photon excitation system in enhancing deep tissue imaging resolution. In this study, we report on the intravital tracking of osteoclast activity in three distinct murine bone disease models. We utilized a cathepsin K (CatK)&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (CatKP1), which exhibited a notable fluorescence turn&#8208;on response in the presence of active CatK. By utilizing CatKP1, we successfully monitored a significant increase in osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones and its attenuation through pharmacological intervention without sacrificing mice. Thus, our findings highlight the efficacy of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for unraveling pathological osteoclast behavior and exploring novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Cyano&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks from Water, Air and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work not only provides new insights into the design of COFs by regulating the amount of charge transfer channels and enhancing the rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation to boost H2O2 photosynthesis, but also paves the way for the practical application of COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts in solar&#8208;driven synthesis.







Abstract
The insufficient exciton (e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pair) separation/transfer and sluggish two&#8208;electron water oxidation are two main factors limiting the H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts. Herein, we present an alternative strategy to simultaneously facilitate exciton separation/transfer and reduce the energy barrier of two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COFs via a dicyano functionalization. The in situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the dicyano functionalization improves the amount of charge transfer channels between donor and acceptor units from two in COF&#8208;0CN without cyano functionalization to three in COF&#8208;1CN with mono&#8208;cyano functionalization and four in COF&#8208;2CN with dicyano functionalization, leading to the highest separation/transfer efficiency in COF&#8208;2CN. More importantly, the dicyano group activates the neighbouring C atom to produce the key *OH intermediate for effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation in H2O2 photosynthesis. The simultaneously enhanced exciton separation/transfer and two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COF&#8208;2CN result in high H2O2 yield (1601&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) from water and oxygen without using sacrificial reagent under visible&#8208;light irradiation. COF&#8208;2CN can effectively yield H2O2 in water with wide pH range, in different real water samples, in scaled&#8208;up reactor under natural sunlight irradiation, and in continuous&#8208;flow reactor for consecutively producing H2O2 solution for water decontamination.

         <title>Confinement of p&#8208;Xylene in the Pores of a Bilanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Selective Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The porosity's significance in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has often been overlooked in luminescent sensing applications. A luminescent MOF NKU&#8208;999 was synthesized with tailored pores for highly selective and quantitative p&#8208;xylene recognition. The sensing mechanism was investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities.







Abstract
The rapid and accurate sensing of p&#8208;xylene, an essential raw material with a multi&#8208;billion&#8208;dollar market, in xylene mixture is of great significance in industry; however, the highly similar molecular structures, energy levels, and spectral characteristics of xylene isomers make the selective recognition extremely challenging. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting tailorable pores and potential binding sites provide prospects for xylene sensing but a comprehensive understanding of the pore effect is still elusive, primarily due to the intricacies involved in the sensing process. Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate p&#8208;xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb exhibits high&#8208;performance in selective recognition for p&#8208;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing p&#8208;xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.

         <title>Aqueous Electroreduction of Nitric Oxide to Ammonia at Low Concentration via Vacancy Engineered FeOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cl vacancy strategy results in a lower Fe oxidation state with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics to enhance the adsorption and activation of NO, which overcomes the sluggish kinetics of NORR and competitive HER over FeOCl&#8208;VCl, especially at low concentrations of NO, and improves the catalytic activity and selectivity towards NORR.







Abstract
Electroreduction of nitric oxide (NO) to NH3 (NORR) has gained extensive attention for the sake of low carbon emission and air pollutant treatment. Unfortunately, NORR is greatly hindered by its sluggish kinetics, especially under low concentrations of NO. Herein, we developed a chlorine (Cl) vacancy strategy to overcome this limitation over FeOCl nanosheets (FeOCl&#8208;VCl).

&lt;p&gt;A Cl vacancy strategy results in a lower Fe oxidation state with sharp d-states characteristics to enhance the adsorption and activation of NO, which overcomes the sluggish kinetics of NORR and competitive HER over FeOCl-V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt;, especially at low concentrations of NO, and improves the catalytic activity and selectivity towards NORR.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of nitric oxide (NO) to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NORR) has gained extensive attention for the sake of low carbon emission and air pollutant treatment. Unfortunately, NORR is greatly hindered by its sluggish kinetics, especially under low concentrations of NO. Herein, we developed a chlorine (Cl) vacancy strategy to overcome this limitation over FeOCl nanosheets (FeOCl-V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt;). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Cl vacancy resulted in defective Fe with sharp d-states characteristics in FeOCl-V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt; to enhance the absorption and activation of NO. In situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) verified the lower average oxidation state of defective Fe to enhance the electron transfer for NO adsorption/activation and facilitate the generation of key NHO and NH&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates. As a result, the FeOCl-V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited superior NORR activities with the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency up to 91.1&#8201;% while maintaining a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 455.4&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO concentration, competitive with those of previously reported literatures under higher NO concentration. Further, the assembled Zn-NO battery utilizing FeOCl-V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt; as cathode delivered a record peak power density of 6.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, offering a new route for simultaneous NO removal, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production, and energy supply.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Nanozyme&#8208;Integrated Nanomotors (POMotors) for Self&#8208;Propulsion&#8208;Promoted Synergistic Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanozyme&#8208;integrated polydopamine&#8208;conjugated nanomotors (POMotors) were constructed. They show peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity and NIR&#8208;triggered photothermal properties, therefore exhibiting enzyme&#8208;powered enhanced Brownian motion and NIR&#8208;triggered self&#8208;propulsion. Based on these properties of POMotors, a highly efficient self&#8208;propulsion&#8208;enhanced photothermal&#8208;catalytic synergistic tumor therapy was achieved.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors have demonstrated promising potential in biomedical applications, especially for catalytic tumor therapy, owing to their ability of self&#8208;propulsion and bio&#8208;catalysis. However, the fragility of natural enzymes limits their environmental adaptability and also therapeutic efficacy in catalysis&#8208;enabled tumor therapy. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;nanozyme&#8208;based light&#8208;driven nanomotors were designed and synthesized for targeted synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic tumor therapy. In this construct, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the P2W18Fe4 polyoxometalates&#8208;based nanomotors can provide self&#8208;propulsion and facilitate their production of reactive oxygen species thus killing tumor cells, even in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment. Conjugated polydopamine endows the nanomotors with the capability of light&#8208;driven self&#8208;propulsion behavior. After 10&#8197;min of NIR (808&#8197;nm) irradiation, along with the help of epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, the targeted accumulation and penetration of nanomotors in the tumor enabled highly efficient synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic therapy. This approach overcomes the disadvantages of the intrinsically fragile nature of enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors in physiological environments and, more importantly, provides a motility&#8208;behavior promoted synergistic anti&#8208;tumor strategy.

Introducing PAnt a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging: PAnt (&#8220;phosphonic acid antenna&#8221;) is a small water&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna tailored to dynamically self&#8208;assemble with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable probe to overcome photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during acquisition are continuously replenished by intact PAnt antennas from a large reservoir, exhibiting remarkable photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, as reported by Angel Orte, Juan A. Gonz&#225;lez&#8208;Vera et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202314595). Artwork by M. Eugenio V&#225;zquez, Univ. of Santiago de Compostela.

In nature, chiral selectivity mainly occurs between different species, such as the production of proteins, enzyme catalysis, or therapeutics using chiral drugs. Thus, there is great demand to explore the full potential of chiral self&#8208;sorting. In their Research Article (e202316200), Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et&#8197;al. report different combinations of axial chiral ligands giving rise to distinct chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.

         <title>Visualizing the Structure, Composition and Activity of Single Catalyst Particles for Olefin Polymerization and Polyolefin Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of laboratory&#8208; and synchrotron&#8208;based chemical imaging techniques can be employed to study heterogeneous catalysts at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This review discusses related advances in the fields of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysis and highlights future research directions that can ultimately deliver more detailed insights into structure&#8208;performance relationships in relevant catalyst materials.







Abstract
The structural and morphological characterization of individual catalyst particles for olefin polymerization, as well as for the reverse process of polyolefin decomposition, can provide an improved understanding for how these catalyst materials operate under relevant reaction conditions. In this review, we discuss an emerging analytical toolbox of 2D and 3D chemical imaging techniques that is suitable for investigating the chemistry and reactivity of related catalyst systems. While synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray microscopy still provides unparalleled spatial resolutions in 2D and 3D, a number of laboratory&#8208;based techniques, most notably focused ion beam&#8208;scanning electron microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, infrared photoinduced force microscopy and laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;computed tomography, have helped to significantly expand the arsenal of analytical tools available to scientists in heterogeneous catalysis and polymer science. In terms of future research, the review outlines the role and impact of in situ and operando (spectro&#8722;)microscopy experiments, involving sophisticated reactors as well as online reactant and product analysis, to obtain real&#8208;time information on the formation, decomposition, and mobility of polymer phases within single catalyst particles. Furthermore, the potential of fluorescence microscopy, X&#8208;ray microscopy and optical microscopy is highlighted for the high&#8208;throughput characterization of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysts. By combining these chemical imaging techniques with, for example, chemical staining methodologies, selective probe molecules as well as particle sorting approaches, representative structure&#8211;activity relationships can be derived at the level of single catalyst particles.

         <title>Precision Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers: From Sequencing to Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers (SDPs), focusing on newly developed sequencing methods including tandem mass spectrometry (MS) based on bond&#8208;selective cleavage and biased ionization, and primary MS based on cascade degradation. Their biological functions are also highlighted, and future perspectives of SDPs outlined.







Abstract
Precise sequence&#8208;defined polymers (SDPs) with uniform chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain structure including chain length, unit sequence, and end functionalities represent the pinnacle of sophistication in the realm of polymer science. For example, the absolute control over the unit sequence of SDPs allows for the bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with hierarchical microstructures and functions. Accompanied with the development of synthetic techniques towards precision SDPs, the decoding of SDP sequences and construction of advanced functions irreplaceable by other synthetic materials is of central importance. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in SDP sequencing techniques including tandem mass spectrometry (MS), chemically assisted primary MS, as well as other non&#8208;destructive sequencing methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we delve into the promising prospects of SDP functions in the area of cutting&#8208;edge biological research. Topics of exploration include gene delivery systems, the development of hybrid materials combining SDPs and nucleic acids, protein recognition and regulation, as well as the interplay between chirality and biological functions. A brief outlook towards the future directions of SDPs is also presented.

         <title>Molecularly generated light and its biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>

Is it possible that light can be formulated as capsules, injection solutions, and packed into polymers? Yes, if the light is generated from molecules. The concept of &#8220;molecular light&#8221; has the potential to significantly expand our perspectives on the potential applications of light.







Abstract
Molecularly generated light, referred to here as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, mainly includes bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and Cerenkov luminescence. Molecular light possesses unique dual features of being both a molecule and a source of light. Its molecular nature enables it to be delivered as molecules to regions deep within the body, overcoming the limitations of natural sunlight and physically generated light sources like lasers and LEDs. Simultaneously, its light properties make it valuable for applications such as imaging, photodynamic therapy, photo&#8208;oxidative therapy, and photobiomodulation. In this review article, we provide an updated overview of the diverse applications of molecular light and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of molecular light across various domains. Lastly, we present forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the potential of molecular light in the realms of molecular imaging, photobiological mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and photobiomodulation. While some of these perspectives may be considered bold and contentious, our intent is to inspire further innovations in the field of molecular light applications.

         <title>Molecular Rotors: Fluorescent Sensors for Microviscosity and Conformation of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we describe recent advances in the development of fluorescence&#8208;based viscosity sensors, termed Molecular Rotors, and discuss how these dyes can be exploited to quantify the microviscosity of biological environment, probe lipid membranes and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures and track dynamic processes, including protein aggregation.







Abstract
The viscosity and crowding of biological environment are considered vital for the correct cellular function, and alterations in these parameters are known to underly a number of pathologies including diabetes, malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few. Over the last decades, fluorescent molecular probes termed molecular rotors proved extremely useful for exploring viscosity, crowding, and underlying molecular interactions in biologically relevant settings. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles underpinning the functionality of these probes and will review advances in their use as sensors for lipid order, protein crowding and conformation, temperature and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures in live cells and other relevant biological settings.

This review discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dyes based on the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold.







Abstract
Activatable fluorescent and chemiluminescent dyes with near&#8208;infrared emission have indispensable roles in the fields of bioimaging, molecular prodrugs, and phototheranostic agents. As one of the most popular fluorophore scaffolds, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran scaffold has been applied to fabricate a large number of versatile activatable optical dyes for analytes detection and diseases diagnosis and treatment by virtue of its high photostability, large Stokes shift, considerable two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, and structural modifiability. This review discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran dyes. The final section describes the current shortcomings and future development prospects of this topic.

         <title>Interfacial Preparation of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hybrid Supramolecular Polymers by Orthogonal Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient strategy is developed to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymers (POM&#8208;SPs) by interfacial orthogonal self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions, POM&#8208;SP&#8208;based interfacial assemblies with redox or competitive agent responsiveness can be achieved.







Abstract
The construction of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid supramolecular polymers using polyoxometalate (POM) as building block is expected to bring new opportunities to the functionalization of supramolecular polymers and the development of novel POM&#8208;based soft materials. Here, by using the orthogonal self&#8208;assembly based on host&#8211;guest interactions and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, we report the in situ construction of a novel POM&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymer (POM&#8208;SP) at the oil&#8208;water interface, while the redox and competitive responsiveness can be triggered independently. Moreover, the binding energy of POM&#8208;SP at the interface is sufficiently strong so that the assembly of POM&#8208;SP jams, allowing the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, offering the possibility of fabricating all&#8208;liquid constructs with reconfigurability.

         <title>Disproportionation of Co2+ in the Topochemically Reduced Oxide LaSrCoRuO5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction of LaSrCoRuO6 yields LaSrCoRuO5 a phase containing Co3+O6, Co1+O4 and Ru3+O5 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry&#8208;driven disproportionation of Co2+ in an extended oxide.







Abstract
Complex transition&#8208;metal oxides exhibit a wide variety of chemical and physical properties which are a strong function the local electronic states of the transition&#8208;metal centres, as determined by a combination of metal oxidation state and local coordination environment. Topochemical reduction of the double perovskite oxide, LaSrCoRuO6, using Zr, yields LaSrCoRuO5. This reduced phase contains an ordered array of apex&#8208;linked square&#8208;based pyramidal Ru3+O5, square&#8208;planar Co1+O4 and octahedral Co3+O6 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of Co2+. Coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of d7 transition&#8208;metal cations (e.g. Rh2+, Pd3+, Pt3+) is common in complex oxides containing 4d and 5d metals. However, the weak ligand field experienced by a 3d transition&#8208;metal such as cobalt leads to the expectation that d7+ Co2+ should be stable to disproportionation in oxide environments, so the presence of Co1+O4 and Co3+O6 units in LaSrCoRuO5 is surprising. Low&#8208;temperature measurements indicate LaSrCoRuO5 adopts a ferromagnetically ordered state below 120&#8197;K due to couplings between S=1/2 Ru3+ and S=1 Co1+.

         <title>Electrochemical Azidocyanation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical alkene azidocyanation reaction that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes was developed. The reactions involving aryl alkenes could be obtained with good enantioselectivities by employing a chiral ligand. Notably, this method of alkene difunctionalization employs readily accessible reagents and is distinguished by its demonstrated functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes&#8212;a process that installs two functional groups in a single operation and transforms chemical feedstocks into value&#8208;added products&#8212;is one of the most appealing synthetic methods in contemporary chemistry. However, the introduction of two distinct functional groups via two readily accessible nucleophiles remains a formidable challenge. Existing intermolecular alkene azidocyanation methods, which primarily focus on aryl alkenes and rely on stoichiometric chemical oxidants. We report herein an unprecedented electrochemical strategy for alkene azidocyanation that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes. This is achieved by harnessing the finely&#8208;tuned anodic electron transfer and the strategic selection of copper/ligand complexes. The reactions of aryl alkenes were rendered enantioselective by employing a chiral ligand. Crucially, the mild conditions and well&#8208;regulated electrochemical process assure exceptional tolerance for various functional groups and substrate compatibility with both terminal and internal alkyl alkenes.

         <title>Selective Hemin Binding by a Non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex Aptamer with Higher Affinity and Better Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using capture&#8208;SELEX, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer for selective hemin binding was obtained, and it did not bind to closely related protoporphyrin IX. The new aptamer doubled heat release compared to a classical G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer, indicating a fundamentally different way of hemin binding.







Abstract
Previous aptamers for porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were all guanine&#8208;rich sequences that can fold in G&#8208;quadruplex structures. Due to stacking&#8208;based binding, these aptamers can hardly tell different porphyrins apart, and they can also bind other planar molecules, hindering their practical applications. In this work, we used the capture selection method to obtain aptamers for hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The hemin aptamer (Hem1) features two highly conserved repeating binding loops, and it cannot form a G&#8208;quadruplex, which was supported by its Mg2+&#8208;dependent but K+&#8208;independent hemin binding and CD spectroscopy. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed much higher enthalpy change for the new aptamer, and the best aptamer showed a Kd of 43&#8197;nM hemin. Hem1 can also enhance the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of hemin. This work demonstrates that aptamers have alternative ways to bind porphyrins allowing selective recognition of different porphyrins.

         <title>Exchangeable Self&#8208;Assembled Lanthanide Antennas for PLIM Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna (PAnt) specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions and act as an exchangeable dye, aiming at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex exhibited an exceptional photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, marking a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging.







Abstract
Lanthanides have unique photoluminescence (PL) emission properties, including very long PL lifetimes. This makes them ideal for biological imaging applications, especially using PL lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). PLIM is an inherently multidimensional technique with exceptional advantages for quantitative biological imaging. Unfortunately, due to the required prolonged acquisitions times, photobleaching of lanthanide PL emission currently constitutes one of the main drawbacks of PLIM. In this study, we report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble, lanthanide antenna, 8&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonic acid, PAnt, specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable dye aimed at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Thus, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during image acquisition are continuously replenished by intact lanthanide antennas from a large reservoir. Remarkably, our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of PL photobleaching when compared to well&#8208;established lanthanide cryptates, used for bioimaging. This concept of exchangeable lanthanide antennas opens new possibilities for quantitative PLIM bioimaging.

         <title>Diadenosine Tetraphosphate (Ap4A) Serves as a 5&#8242; RNA Cap in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diadenosine tetraphosphate&#8208;RNA (Ap4A&#8208;RNA) is found in human and rat cell lines. Its amount is not dependent on the intracellular concentration of Ap4A. Ap4A&#8208;RNA is decapped by two enzymes, NUDT2 and DXO. Even though Ap4A&#8208;RNA is present in the same fraction as mRNA, it is not translated. However, it is recognized as self RNA by the innate immune system, as it does not elicit an immune response.







Abstract
The recent expansion of the field of RNA chemical modifications has changed our understanding of post&#8208;transcriptional gene regulation. Apart from internal nucleobase modifications, 7&#8208;methylguanosine was long thought to be the only eukaryotic RNA cap. However, the discovery of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps in eukaryotes revealed a new niche of previously undetected RNA chemical modifications. We are the first to report the existence of a new non&#8208;canonical RNA cap, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), in human and rat cell lines. Ap4A is the most abundant dinucleoside polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells and can be incorporated into RNA by RNA polymerases as a non&#8208;canonical initiating nucleotide (NCIN). Using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS), we show that the amount of capped Ap4A&#8208;RNA is independent of the cellular concentration of Ap4A. A decapping enzyme screen identifies two enzymes cleaving Ap4A&#8208;RNA,NUDT2 and DXO, both of which also cleave other substrate RNAs in vitro. We further assess the translatability and immunogenicity of Ap4A&#8208;RNA and show that although it is not translated, Ap4A&#8208;RNA is recognized as self by the cell and does not elicit an immune response, making it a natural component of the transcriptome. Our findings open a previously unexplored area of eukaryotic RNA regulation.

Abstract
We report examples of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;S, and C(sp2)&#8722;P bond&#8208;forming transformations in water microdroplets at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using N2 as a nebulizing gas. When an aqueous solution of vinylic acid and amine is electrosprayed (+3&#8197;kV), the corresponding C(sp2)&#8722;N product is formed in a single step, which was characterized using mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS2). The scope of this reaction was extended to other amines and other unsaturated acids, including acrylic (CH2=CHCOOH) and crotonic (CH3CH=CHCOOH) acids. We also found that thiols and phosphines are viable nucleophiles, and the corresponding C(sp2)&#8722;S and C(sp2)&#8722;P products are observed in positive ion mode using MS and MS2.

         <title>Acyl and CO Ligands in the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Scramble upon Photolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase cofactor contains an acyl&#8208; and two CO&#8208;ligands. Biosynthesis using stable isotopes demonstrated the formation of the acyl ligand from the carboxy group of the precursor, and MS/MS analysis indicated that the acyl and CO ligands exchanged during photolysis. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy revealed the presence of an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate during photolysis, which could explain the acyl/CO ligand exchange.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase harbors the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, in which the Fe(II) complex contains acyl&#8208;carbon, pyridinol&#8208;nitrogen, cysteine&#8208;thiolate and two CO as ligands. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light decomposes the FeGP cofactor to a 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (GP) and other components. Previous in vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated that the acyl&#8208; and CO&#8208;ligands in the FeGP cofactor can scramble, but whether scrambling occurred during biosynthesis or photolysis was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the [18O1&#8208;carboxy]&#8208;group of GP is incorporated into the FeGP cofactor by in vitro biosynthesis. MS/MS analysis of the 18O&#8208;labeled FeGP cofactor revealed that the produced [18O1]&#8208;acyl group is not exchanged with a CO ligand of the cofactor, indicating that the acyl and CO ligands are scrambled during photolysis rather than biosynthesis, which ruled out any biosynthesis mechanisms allowing acyl/CO ligands scrambling. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate is formed during photolysis, in which scrambling of the CO and acyl ligands can occur. This finding also suggests that the light&#8208;excited FeGP cofactor has a higher affinity for external CO. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and photosensitive properties of this unique H2&#8208;activating natural complex.

         <title>Photochemical Deoxygenative Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes Promoted by a Nucleophilic Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photochemical method for deoxygenative hydroalkylation of a wide range of alkenes and lactic acid derivatives is reported. This approach utilizes thiophenol as a nucleophilic organic catalyst which forms the key intermediate of this transformation via an SN2 process.







Abstract
The direct utilization of simple and abundant feedstocks in carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions to embellish sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is highly desirable. Herein, we report a novel photochemical deoxygenative hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with readily available carboxylic acid derivatives. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, accommodating carboxylic acid&#8208;, alcohol&#8208;, ester&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, amide&#8208;, silane&#8208;, and boronic ester groups, as well as nitrile&#8208;containing substrates. The reaction is operationally simple, mild, and water&#8208;tolerant, and can be carried out on multigram&#8208;scale, which highlights the utility of the method to prepare value&#8208;added compounds in a practical and scalable manner. The synthetic application of the developed method is further exemplified through the synthesis of suberanilic acid, a precursor of vorinostat, a drug used for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. A novel mechanistic approach was identified using thiol as a nucleophilic catalyst, which forms a key intermediate for this transformation. Furthermore, electrochemical studies, quantum yield, and mechanistic experiments were conducted to support a proposed catalytic cycle for the transformation.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive (3+2) Annulation of Lactams Enabling the Rapid Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Eburnamonine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams was developed through a sequential process consisting of iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group followed by iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid. The method was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.







Abstract
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams through iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid was developed. The iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group and subsequent elimination provide a transient cyclic enamine, which undergoes iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid in a one&#8208;pot process. The developed conditions show high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provide cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals containing a quaternary carbon center. The resulting N,O&#8208;acetals undergo a variety of acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition reactions via iminium ions to give substituted cyclic amines. The developed sequence including reductive (3+2) annulation and acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Generation of Tertiary Anions from Primary Amines via a Radical Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deaminative radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy generating carbanions is reported. This so called &#8220;aza&#8208;Reformatsky&#8221; reaction leverages the use of redox&#8208;active imines and an iridium photocatalyst to generate a wide array of tertiary benzylic, heteroarylbenzylic and &#945;&#8208;ester anions, which can be trapped with different electrophiles.







Abstract
A method for the generation of tertiary carbanions via a deaminative radical&#8208;polar crossover is reported using redox active imines from &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines. A variety of benzylic amines and amino esters can be used in this approach, with the latter engaging in a novel &#8220;aza&#8208;Reformatsky&#8221; reaction. Electronic trends correlate the stability of the resulting carbanion with reaction efficiency. The anions can be trapped with different electrophiles including aldehydes, ketones, imines, Michael acceptors, and H2O/D2O. Selective anion formation can be achieved in the presence of another equivalent or more acidic C&#8722;H bond in both an inter&#8208; and intramolecular fashion. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a discrete carbanion intermediate.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Regioselective Diborylation of Aryllithium with Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free highly regioselective and efficient o&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been developed, leading to a family of o&#8208;diborylarenes in very good yields under mild reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that an aromatic nucleophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H substitution pathway may be involved.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been achieved, giving a series of 1,2&#8208;diborylaryl lithium species in excellent yields under mild reaction conditions, which leads to 1,2&#8208;di(tolyl)borylarenes in 60&#8211;91&#8201;% yields upon treatment with the hydride&#8208;abstracting reagent. In these transformations, one sp2 C&#8722;H of arene is activated and both boryl units are utilized to build two new (sp2)C&#8722;B bonds. This represents a new strategy for selective arene diborylation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that an aromatic nucleophilic substitution is a key step in the formation of the products.

An unprecedented (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes is achieved by &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic palladium (0) catalysis, delivering benzofuran&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Highly diastereoselective derivatizations of the resultant eight&#8208;membered cyclic alkenes provide a facile access to diverse fused polycyclic compounds in excellent efficiency.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented enantioselective (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes for the construction of fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. In this transformation, the &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic Pd(0) catalyst achieves activation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to induce nucleophilic addition to azadienes followed by ring cyclization via a selective terminal allylic substitution. Furthermore, highly efficient and diastereoselective derivatizations of the eight&#8208;membered rings provide a facile access to diverse enantiopure fused tetra&#8208; to hexacyclic compounds with potential application in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Decarboxylative Radical Sulfilimination via Photoredox, Copper, and Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The mild, operationally simple reaction has good functional group compatibility. Our findings provide a Br&#248;nsted base activation strategy for metallaphotoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Sulfilimines, the aza&#8208;variants of sulfoxides, are key structural motifs in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals; and sulfilimine synthesis is therefore important in organic chemistry. However, methods for radical sulfilimination remain elusive, and as a result, the structural diversity of currently available sulfilimines is limited. Herein, we report the first protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. This novel protocol provided a wide variety of sulfilimines, in addition to serving as an efficient route for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl/S&#8208;aryl homocysteine sulfilimines and S&#8208;(4&#8208;methylphenyl) homocysteine sulfoximine. Moreover, it could be used for late&#8208;stage introduction of a sulfilimine group into structurally complex molecules, thereby avoiding the need to preserve labile organosulfur moieties through multistep synthetic sequences. A mechanism involving photocatalytic substrate transformation and copper&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond formation is proposed.

         <title>In Situ Chiral Template Approach to Synthesize Homochiral Lead Iodides for Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ chiral template approach has been developed for the synthesis of homochiral lead iodides, demonstrating the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Homochiral halide perovskites have gained increasing attention because of their fascinating optoelectronic properties and prospective applications in laser technologies. However, the limited choice of chiral organic templates severely restricts their structural diversity and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) effects. Here, we present an in situ chiral template approach for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) homochiral lead iodides. A chiral imine (L&#8208;ipp) template was generated in situ by reacting L&#8208;proline (L&#8208;pro) and acetone under ambient conditions. Notably, L&#8208;ipp can cooperate with L&#8208;pro to direct the formation of a homochiral lead iodide with dual chiral templates, which is unprecedented in crystalline metal halides. The homochiral lead iodide containing both L&#8208;ipp and L&#8208;pro shows a strong SHG response of 8.0&#8197;times that of KH2PO4 (8.0&#215;KDP). The SHG efficiency is one of the largest values reported to date for any homochiral lead halides under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. A comparative study shows that homochiral 1D lead iodides containing either L&#8208;ipp or L&#8208;pro exhibit relatively weak SHG responses (&#8804;1.0&#215;KDP). This work demonstrates the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the SHG responses of halide materials.

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Functionalization of an Acyclic Methylene&#8208;Bridged&#8208;Arene Trimer in a Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of repeating reactions to form oligomeric compounds is challenging because such reactions are controlled only statistically. Here, we show that a coordination cage serves as a nano&#8208;reaction vessel in the iteroselective condensation of a simple aromatic compound and formaldehyde to form a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent iodination of the trimer within the cage.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;formaldehyde condensation is a versatile reaction for producing various oligomeric/polymeric materials. However, the precise control of oligomerization degree is still challenging because the starting materials and intermediates have similar reactivities. Here, we demonstrate the selective synthesis of a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer using the confined cavity of a coordination cage. The limited space of the cavity prevents unregulated polymerization. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent site&#8208;selective iodination of the trimer product within the cage.

         <title>Amphiphilic Covalent Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Pickering Emulsion Catalysis with Size Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting advanced amphiphilic solid catalysts is crucial to the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis. Herein, covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed using highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were found to show superior amphiphilicity and they were then developed as a new class of solid surfactants for Pickering emulsion catalysis. Employing amphiphilic COFs as solid emulsifiers, Pickering emulsions with controllable emulsion type and droplet sizes were obtained. COF materials have also been demonstrated to serve as porous surface coatings to replace traditional surface modifications for stabilizing Pickering emulsions. After implanting Pd nanoparticles into amphiphilic COFs, the obtained catalyst displayed a 3.9 times higher catalytic efficiency than traditional amphiphilic solid catalysts with surface modifications in the biphasic oxidation reaction of alcohols. Such an enhanced activity was resulted from the high surface area and regular porous structure of COFs. More importantly, because of their tunable pore diameters, Pickering emulsion catalysis with remarkable size selectivity was achieved. This work is the first example that COFs were applied in Pickering emulsion catalysis, providing a platform for exploring new frontiers of Pickering emulsion catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Bifunctional Chemoselective Metabolome Analysis of Liver Disease Plasma Using the Reagent 4&#8208;Nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid functional group transformation of carboxylic acids into a new ketone under mild conditions using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. The newly formed ketone was captured by our chemical probe methodology for quantification with enhanced mass spectrometric sensitivity. This bifunctional methodology is a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.







Abstract
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging. Derivatization of carboxylic acids represents a strategy to overcome these limitations but available methods suffer from diverse analytical challenges. Herein, we have designed a novel strategy introducing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine as a new chemoselective moiety for the first time for carboxylic acid metabolites. This moiety was selected as it rapidly forms a stable amide bond and also generates a new ketone, which can be analyzed by our recently developed quant&#8208;SCHEMA method specific for carbonyl metabolites. Optimization of this new method revealed a high reproducibility and robustness, which was utilized to validate 102&#8197;metabolic carboxylic acids using authentic synthetic standard conjugates in human plasma samples including nine metabolites that were newly detected. Using this sequential analysis of the carbonyl&#8208; and carboxylic acid&#8208;metabolomes revealed alterations of the ketogenesis pathway, which demonstrates the vast benefit of our unique methodology. We anticipate that the developed azirine moiety with rapid functional group transformation will find broad application in diverse chemical biology research fields.

         <title>Enhancing Plasmonic Hot Electron Energy on Ag Surface by Amine Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface coordination induces a substantial enhancement in plasmonic hot electron energy, thereby enabling the achievement of previously inaccessible visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=F, Cl) bonds using individual plasmonic metal.







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis has emerged as a promising approach to solar&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Notably, hot carriers play a decisive role in plasmonic catalysis since only when their energy matches with the LUMO or HOMO energy of the reactant molecule, can the reaction be activated. However, the hot carrier energy depends on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the plasmonic metal substrate and the interaction with incident light. Tuning the hot carrier energy is of great significance for plasmonic catalysis but remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the energy of hot electrons can be significantly elevated to an unprecedented level through the coordination of amines on Ag surface. The bonding of amines and Ag reduces the work function of nanoparticles, leading to the increase of hot electron energy by 0.4&#8197;eV. This enhancement of energy promotes the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=Cl, F) bonds upon excitation by visible light. This study provides new insights for promoting plasmonic charge transfer and enhancing the photocatalytic performance of plasmon&#8208;mediated systems.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Incarnatapeptins A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and the unusual use of silver carbonate to promote N&#8208;acylation, the first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B has been achieved, which unambiguously confirmed the structure of these natural products.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B, two novel marine natural products, was accomplished from readily available (S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyloxycarbonylhexahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid. This route, whose longest linear sequence was 12 steps, provided the incarnatapeptins A and B in yields of 26.5&#8201;% and 19.7&#8201;%, respectively, and enabled the structure and stereochemistry of both natural products to be unambiguously confirmed. Highlights of our synthesis include the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and a novel and practical N&#8208;acylation paradigm promoted by silver carbonate. The unusual facile atropisomerism of some linear peptidic intermediates was also observed by TLC analysis in the course of this work.

         <title>Unraveling the &#8220;Gap&#8208;Filling&#8221; Mechanism of Multiple Charge Carriers in Aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid featuring ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing, superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure demonstrates highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries, where NH4+ and H+ can serve as &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; ions to improve the utilization rate of active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
The utilization rate of active sites in cathode materials for Zn&#8208;based batteries is a key factor determining the reversible capacities. However, a long&#8208;neglected issue of the strong electrostatic repulsions among divalent Zn2+ in hosts inevitably causes the squander of some active sites (i.e., gap sites). Herein, we address this conundrum by unraveling the &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; mechanism of multiple charge carriers in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. The tailored MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid features an ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing (2.34&#8197;nm), superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure, demonstrating highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in the 1&#8197;M ZnSO4+0.5&#8197;M (NH4)2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The NH4+ and H+ ions can act as gap fillers to fully utilize the active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to accelerate the Zn2+ diffusion. Thus, unprecedentedly high rate capability (439.5 and 104.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) and ultra&#8208;long cycling life (8000 cycles) are achieved.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte formed via diluting ionic liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent is proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. It presents better fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, as well as a faster kinetics, enabling a long&#8208;life&#8208;span Al&#8722;S batteries under &#8722;20&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8722;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries, especially at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent are proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries. As a result, Al&#8722;S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. For instance, Al&#8722;S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while only 229&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is delivered with the dFBn&#8208;free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide&#8208;temperature Al&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Enabling Stable and low&#8208;strain Lithium Plating/Stripping with 2D Layered Transition Metal Carbides by Forming Li&#8208;Zipped MXenes and a Li halide&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials demonstrate prominent advantage in regulating lithium plating/stripping behavior by confining lithium diffusion/plating within interlayer gaps. However, achieving effective interlayer confined lithium diffusion/plating without compromising the stability of bulk&#8208;structural and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains a considerable challenge. This paper presents an electrochemical scissor and Li zipper&#8208;driven protocol for realizing interlayer confined Li plating with pretty&#8208;low strain and volume change. In this protocol, lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the structural stability, and a Li halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by electrochemically removing the terminals of halogenated MXenes to maintain the stability and rapid Li+ diffusion of SEI. When the Ti3C2I2 serves as the host for lithium plating, the average coulomb efficiency exceeds 97.0% after 320 lithium plating/stripping cycles in conventional ester electrolyte. Furthermore, a full cell comprising of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Ti3C2I2@Li exhibits a capacity retention rate of 73.4% after 200 cycles even under high cathode mass&#8208;loading (20 mg cm&#8208;2) and a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.4. Our findings advance the understanding of interlayer confined lithium plating in 2D layered materials and provide a new direction in regulating the Li and other metal plating/stripping behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Loss of Fast Charging Capability in Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast charging technology for electric vehicles (EVs), offering rapid charging times similar to conventional vehicle refueling, holds promise but faces obstacles owing to kinetic issues within lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Specifically, the significance of cathode materials in fast charging has grown because Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are employed to enhance the energy density of LIBs. Herein, the mechanism behind the loss of fast charging capability of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during extended cycling is investigated through a comparative analysis of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with different microstructures. The results revealed that microcracks and the resultant cathode deterioration significantly compromised the fast charging capability over extended cycling. When thick rocksalt impurity phases form throughout the particles owing to electrolyte infiltration via microcracks, the limited kinetics of Li+ ions create electrochemically unreactive areas under high&#8208;current conditions, resulting in the loss of fast charging capability. Hence, preventing microcrack formation by tailoring microstructures is essential to ensure stability in fast charging capability. Understanding the relationship between microcracks and the loss of fast charging capability is essential for developing Ni&#8208;rich cathodes that facilitate stable fast charging upon extended cycling, thereby promoting widespread EV adoption.</dc:description>

         <title>CO&#8208;induced dimer decay responsible for gem&#8208;dicarbonyl formation on a model single&#8208;atom catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide&#8208;spread applicability of single&#8208;atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single&#8208;crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh1 adatoms and minority Rh2 dimers on Fe3O4(001) during exposure to CO using time&#8208;lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results exclusively in stable Rh1CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo&#8208;square planar environment. Rh1(CO)2 gem&#8208;dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh2 dimers via an unstable Rh2(CO)3 intermediate. Overall, our results illustrate how minority species invisible to area&#8208;averaging spectra can play an important role in catalytic systems, and show that the decomposition of dimers or small clusters can be an avenue to produce reactive, metastable configurations in single&#8208;atom catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) Analysis of Proteins with High Matrix Content: Utilizing Taylor&#8208;Aris Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This is the first work demonstrating the utility of the Taylor&#8208;Aris (TA) dispersion in avoiding serious interference issues commonly occurring in the electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometric (ESI&#8208;MS) determination of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals undergoing no pre&#8208;separation or sample purification. It was also pointed out that the TA dispersion conditions and its analytical utilization for proteomics can be easily accomplished in a commercial CE&#8208;MS instrument. In the proposed Taylor&#8208;Aris dispersion&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (TADA&#8208;MS) analysis 0.5 &#181;L sample is injected into a 65 cm long 50 &#181;m i.d. capillary and pumped with 1 bar toward the MS. The procedure is efficient for the direct injection analysis of components having low diffusion coefficients (proteins) that are present in complex matrices of small organic and inorganic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifold Post&#8208;Modification of Macrocycles and Cages by Isocyanate&#8208;Induced Azadefluorination Cyclisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the multiple post&#8208;modification of organic macrocycles and cages, introducing functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents, which opens up new possibilities in multi&#8208;step supramolecular chemistry employing the vast chemical space of readily available isocyanates. The mechanism and scope of the reaction that proceeds after isocyanate addition to the benzylamine motif&#160;via&#160;an azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC) were investigated using DFT calculations, and a series of aromatic isocyanates with different electronic properties were tested. The compounds show excellent chemical stability and were fully characterised. They can be used for subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and ADFC can be used directly to generate cross&#8208;linked membranes from macrocycles or cages when using ditopic isocyanates. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis shows the proof of the formation of the desired supramolecular entity together with the connectivity predicted by calculations and from 19F NMR shifts, allowing the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages by ADFC.</dc:description>

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8208; and NO2&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8208; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8208;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8% at &#8208;0.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8208;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8208;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>A Semisynthesis Platform for the Efficient Production and Exploration of Didemnin&#8208;Based Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anti&#8208;cancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Here, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a Tistrella strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titre of approximately 75 mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B to plitidepsin, one of which involved a one&#8208;step synthetic route giving over 90% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesised 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins. Our study highlights the synergistic potential of biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in overcoming the challenge of producing complex natural products sustainably and at scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenge s, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8208;700 nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4 mA cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000 hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Turn&#8208;On Strategy to Profile E2&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination Events in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, which controls many different aspects of cellular signaling. The role of the E2 has been largely overlooked, despite influencing substrate identity, chain multiplicity, and topology. Here we report a method &#8211; targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2 (tCUbE) &#8211; that can track a tagged ubiquitin through its entire enzymatic cascade in living mammalian cells. We use this approach to reveal new targets whose ubiquitination depends on UbcH5a E2 activity. We demonstrate that tCUbE can be broadly applied to multiple E2s and in different human cell lines. tCUbE is uniquely suited to examine E2&#8208;E3&#8208;substrate cascades of interest and/or piece together previously unidentified cascades, thereby illuminating entire branches of the UPS and providing critical insight that will be useful for identifying new therapeutic targets in the UPS.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity and activity of formate over the copper electrode are dramatically promoted by the modification of cationic Gemini surfactants. Furthermore, on a Gemini surfactant modified Bi2O3 electrode, a formate FE of 91&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This improvement in formate production was attributed to the combined effects of the cations and alkyl chains present in the Gemini surfactants.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO2 electroreduction to formate.

     alt="Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selectivity and activity of formate over the copper electrode are dramatically promoted by the modification of cationic Gemini surfactants. Furthermore, on a Gemini surfactant modified Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrode, a formate FE of 91&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This improvement in formate production was attributed to the combined effects of the cations and alkyl chains present in the Gemini surfactants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to formate. The selectivity, activity and stability of the catalysts can be all significantly enhanced by Gemini surfactant modification. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate could reach up to 96&#8201;%, and the energy efficiency (EE) could achieve 71&#8201;% over the Gemini surfactants modified Cu electrode. In addition, the Gemini surfactants modified commercial Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets also showed an excellent catalytic performance, and the FE of formate reached 91&#8201;% with a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; using the flow cell. Detailed studies demonstrated that the double quaternary ammonium cations and alkyl chains of the Gemini surfactants played a crucial role in boosting electroreduction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can not only stabilize the key intermediate HCOO* but also provide an easy access for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These observations could shine light on the rational design of organic modifiers for promoted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage. The performance of these materials is closely related to their pore sizes, which are inefficient to determine through the conventional measurement of gas adsorption isotherms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry has emerged as a technique highly sensitive to porosity in such materials. Nonetheless, streamlined methods to estimate pore size from NMR relaxometry remain elusive. Previous attempts have been hindered by inverting a time domain signal to relaxation rate distribution, and dealing with resulting parameters that vary in number, location, and magnitude.&#160;Here we invoke well&#8208;established machine learning techniques to directly correlate time domain signals to BET surface areas for a set of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) imbibed with solvent at varied concentrations. We employ this series of MOFs to establish a correlation between NMR signal and surface area&#160;via partial least squares (PLS), following screening with principal component analysis, and apply the PLS model to predict surface area&#160;of various nanoporous materials. This approach offers a high&#8208;throughput, non&#8208;destructive way to assess porosity in c.a. one minute. We anticipate this work will contribute to the development of new materials with optimized pore sizes for various applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8211;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8211;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8210;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 98:2 er). The practicality of this method was demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate was isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with over 19% Efficiency and Enhanced Morphology Stability Enabled by Asymmetric Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercialization remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed asymmetric acceptors DT&#8208;C8Cl and DT&#8208;C8BTz with functional haloalkyl chains, in which the halogen atoms could induce noncovalent interactions with heteroatoms like O, S, and Se, etc., thus leading to appropriately manipulated film morphology. Consequently, binary devices based on D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40%. The higher PCE of D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl could be attributed to the enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. In addition, the noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions and thereby reduce trap density of states, leading to improved thermal and storage stability. Overall, our findings reveal that the rational design of asymmetric acceptors with functional haloalkyl chains is a novel and powerful strategy for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and stereoselective approach for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups has been reported. TBAF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O exhibits high compatibility, allowing for easy incorporation of fluoride into SF5 and SF4 alkynes at room temperature. Competitive experiments and DFT calculations verify that SF5 alkynes react much faster than SF4 alkynes.







Abstract
The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanting SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to strengthen and stabilize the supramolecular polymer network is reported. The superb multivalence cooperation makes the hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect, resulting in a superroubst and recyclable supramolecular polymer network with remarkably high resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and H&#8208;bond&#8208;destructive solvents.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1&#8197;GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.

Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H-bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H-bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H-bonds. The rationally designed H-bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H-bond arrays comprising higher-density and stronger H-bonds. Consequently, the H-bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on-demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1&#8197;GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Despite the covalent-network-like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high-polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal chemistry&#8208;based senolytic strategy for the selective treatment of senescent cells has been developed. We demonstrate that a dihydrotetrazine&#8208;galactose conjugate (Gal&#8208;Tz) can be selectively converted into the free tetrazine by senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This strategy can be harnessed for bioorthogonal imaging as well as prodrug delivery and activation in senescent cancer cells.







Abstract
Although the clearance of senescent cells has been proven to slow down the aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is based on linking dihydrotetrazine (Tz) to a galactose (Gal) moiety that serves both as a recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and a caging group for the control of tetrazine activity. Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of a fluorescent hemicyanine and doxorubicin from a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with a 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for the selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce the degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4. Senolytic PROTACs may offer an efficient way for intervention on cell senescence thanks to their unique capacity to degrade target proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of this study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8722;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV was prepared by a solvothermal method for efficient sonodynamic therapy. Abundant oxygen vacancies were introduced into the nanobrush through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction reaction and can serve as charge traps to inhibit e&#8722;&#8208;h+ recombination. The almost ideal band structures of the nanobrush endow it with the potential to simultaneously produce 1O2, &#8901;O2&#8722;, and &#8901;OH under ultrasound irradiation.







Abstract
With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8208;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism is achieved by synthetic electron shuttle&#8208;activated transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture. It offers a new and efficient route to realize artificial bioenergy production, holding great promise in ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.







Abstract
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, a dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in the mitochondrion respiratory chain, a small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in the lipid bilayer facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and a proton. These facilitate an enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing a synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes with Dual Negatively Curved Heptagons: Extensive Synthesis and Spontaneous Resolution into Strippable Homochiral Lamellae with Helical Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with fused negative curvature and helicity have been facilely synthesized by twofold heptagonal cyclization. In addition to intriguing features arising from the dynamic chiral skeleton, the molecular packing of these curved helicenes can be modulated by the periphery groups and the extension of the skeleton. This leads to the formation of crystals with 31 helices and also homochiral nanosheets upon exfoliation.







Abstract
We report a unique category of &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with double negative curvatures. This is achieved by two&#8208;fold regioselective heptagonal cyclization of the oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole precursors through either intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation or Scholl reaction. The fusion of two heptagonal rings in the helical skeleton dramatically increases the intramolecular strain and forces the two terminal carbazole moieties to stack in a compressed fashion. The presence of the deformable negatively curved heptagonal rings endows the resulting diaza[7]helicenes with dynamic chiral skeletons, aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature and relatively low racemization barrier of ca. 25.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Further &#960;&#8208;extension on the carbazole moieties subsequently leads to a more sophisticated C2&#8208;symmetric homochiral triple helicene. Notably, these &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes show structure&#8208;dependent stacking upon crystallization, switching from heterochiral packing to intra&#8208;layer homochiral stacking. Interestingly, the C2&#8208;symmetric triple helicene molecules spontaneously resolve into a homochiral lamellar structure with 31 helix symmetry. Upon ultrasonication in a nonsolvent, the crystals can be readily exfoliated into large&#8208;area ultrathin nanosheets with height of ca. 4.4&#8197;nm corresponding to two layers of stacked triple helicene molecules and relatively thicker nanosheets constituted by even&#8208;numbered molecular lamellae. Moreover, regular hexagonal thin platelets with size larger than 30&#8197;&#956;m can be readily fabricated by flash aggregation.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Trace Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Rate and Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives are inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, which implements a dual remodeling effect on Zn2+ solvation shell and Zn surface molecules, facilitating long&#8208;term stable and high&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion batteries at ultra&#8208;low temperatures.







Abstract
High&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries working at low temperatures are highly desirable for practical applications, but are challenged by sluggish kinetics and severe corrosion. Herein, inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, we report trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives that implement a dual remodeling effect for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The additive with high Zn absorbability not only remodels Zn2+ primary solvent shell by alternating H2O molecules, but also forms a shielding layer thus remodeling the Zn surface, which effectively enhances fast Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation reaction kinetics and prohibits Zn anode corrosion. Taking trace &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (&#945;DG) as a demonstration, the electrolyte obtains a low freezing point of &#8722;55.3&#8201;&#176;C, and the Zn//Zn cell can stably cycle for 2000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, with a high cumulative capacity of 5000&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A full battery that stably operates for 10000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is also demonstrated.

         <title>Lithiophilic Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Coating for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable polyimide 2D covalent organic framework (COF), which has abundant lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units within the 1D channels. The COF can serve as an intermediate layer to guide the uniform electrodeposition of lithium ion, leading to the formation of dense and smooth lithium deposition layer in a cylindrical morphology and steady lithium plating/stripping behaviors.







Abstract
The growth of disorganized lithium dendrites and weak solid electrolyte interphase greatly impede the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new kind of stable polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have a high density of well&#8208;aligned lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units anchored within the uniform one&#8208;dimensional channels. The COFs can serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, effectively guiding the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. The unsymmetrical Li||COF&#8722;Cu battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which can be well retained up to 400&#8197;cycles. Meanwhile, the Li&#8208;COF||LFP full cell shows a Coulombic efficiency over 99&#8201;% at a charge of 0.3&#8197;C. And its capacity can be well maintained up to 91&#8201;% even after 150&#8197;cycles. Therefore, the significant electrochemical cycling stability illustrates the feasibility of employing COFs in solving the disordered deposition of lithium ions in lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Rapid Synthesis of MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Ni Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts within 3&#8197;min. Specifically, the optimized single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon materials (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) based on a metal&#8211;organic framework precursor showcases a tremendous CO partial current density of 1.06&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96&#8201;% in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the common electric heating techniques to produce carbon&#8208;based SACs usually suffer from prolonged heating time and tedious operations. Herein, a general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based SACs within 3&#8197;min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon&#8208;based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) derived from a Ni&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) exhibits remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (96&#8201;%) with a substantial CO partial current density (jCO) up to 1.06&#8197;A/cm2 in CO2 electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that the resulting Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO2 adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon&#8208;based materials for efficient catalysis.

         <title>Dynamic Shape Change of Liquid Crystal Polymer Based on An Order&#8208;Order Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodomain liquid crystal polymer exhibits dynamic shape changes, undergoing extension first and then contraction during both heating and cooling. This behavior is driven by a dynamic order&#8208;order smectic C to smectic A phase transition.







Abstract
Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order&#8208;disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order&#8208;order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re&#8208;entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower&#8208;shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.

Anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals synthesized by one&#8208;step mechanochemical method for high&#8208;efficiency photo&#8208;thermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation.

Abstract
An anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono&#8208;radical charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals for near&#8208;infrared photothermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red&#8208;shifted absorption (200&#8211;2000&#8197;nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5&#8201;%@808&#8197;nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one&#8208;step mechanochemistry method in practical large&#8208;scale seawater desalination applications.

&lt;p&gt;An anion-counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono-radical charge-transfer cocrystals for near-infrared photothermal conversion and solar-driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red-shifted absorption (200&#8211;2000&#8197;nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5&#8201;%@808&#8197;nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar-driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1&#8197;sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge-transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar-driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one-step mechanochemistry method in practical large-scale seawater desalination applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.</dc:description>

         <title>A Programmable DNAzyme for the Sensitive Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop&#8208;initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one&#8208;stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost&#8208;effective detection of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylphoshinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late&#8208;Stage S&#8208;Imination To Access Free&#8208;NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfilimines, as potential aza&#8208;isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH). Under mild, metal&#8208;free, and biomolecule&#8208;compatible conditions, DPPH enables late&#8208;stage S&#8208;imination on peptides, natural products, and a clinically trialled drug, and shows both excellent chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. This methodological report is extended to an efficient and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot reaction for accessing free&#8208;NH sulfoximines with diverse substrates including ones of potential clinical importance. In the presence of a rhodium catalyst, sulfoxides are S&#8208;iminated in higher yields to afford free&#8208;NH sulfoximines. S&#8208;imination was validated on an oxidatively delicate amatoxin to give sulfilimine and sulfoximine congeners. Interestingly, these new sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;amatoxins show cytotoxicity. This is further extended to create sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;Fulvestrant and Buthionine analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogenous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5 wt% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300 h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 and retains 89 % of discharge capacity (138.9 mAh g&#8208;1) after 100 cycles at 1 C in the LFP//Li full cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulse&#160;Electrolysis Turns on CO2 Methanation through N&#8208;Confused Cupric Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breaking the D4h symmetry in the square&#8208;planar M&#8208;N4 configuration of macrocycle molecular catalysts has witnessed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, but at the expense of electrochemical stability. Herein, we hypothesize that the lability of the active Cu&#8208;N3 motifs in the N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CuNCP) could be overcome by applying pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE) during electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. We find that applying PPE can indeed enhance the CH4 selectivity on CuNCP by 3 folds to reach the partial current density of 170 mA cm&#8208;2 at &gt;60% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in flow cell. However, combined ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR), Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations reveal that, in a prolonged time scale, the decomplexation of CuNCP is unavoidable, and the promoted water dissociation under high anodic bias with lowered pH and enriched protons facilitates successive hydrogenation of *CO on the irreversibly reduced Cu nanoparticles, leading to the improved CH4 selectivity. As a key note, this study signifies the adaption of electrolytic protocol to the catalyst structure for tailoring local chemical environment towards efficient CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8208; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8208;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3||Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4 mAh gPDSe&#8208;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4 V), high energy density (578.3 Wh kgPDSe&#8208;1), and ultralong lifespan (12 000 cycles) at 10 A g&#8208;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high-energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high-voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion-coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron-involved positive-valence oxidation and negative-valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe-SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)- to (PhSe-SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF-). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK-3||Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4 mAh gPDSe-1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4 V), high energy density (578.3 Wh kgPDSe-1), and ultralong lifespan (12 000 cycles) at 10 A g-1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion-type active site engineering for high-voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high-energy AZBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Ru Nanoparticles with Parasitic Ru&#8211;Co Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atoms Overcome the Volmer Step of Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and achieving facile dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles by embedding Co single atoms which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen&#8208;affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom within Ru nanoparticles. The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H2O. As anticipated, Co1Ru1,n/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68 A mgRu&#8208;1) at 50 mV and exchange current density (0.68 mA cm&#8208;2), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts. This investigation provides valuable insights into hybrid multi&#8208;single&#8208;atom and metal nanoparticle catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Substantial Impact of Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Electrode Potential on the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Ru&#8208;CoP Urchin Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although great efforts on the delicate construction of a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) to modify the electronic properties of active sites have been conducted, the substantial impact of BIEF coupled with electrode potential on the electrochemical reactions has not been clearly investigated. Herein, we designed an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of heterogeneous Ru&#8208;CoP urchin arrays on carbon cloth (Ru&#8208;CoP/CC) with a strong BIEF with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, despite its unsatisfactory activity at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 (overpotential of 44 mV), Ru&#8208;CoP/CC exhibited better activity (357 mV) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (505 mV) at 1 A cm&#8208;2. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low current densities. However, as the electrode potential became more negative (i.e., the current density increased), the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus greatly accelerating the whole alkaline HER process. This explains why the activity of Ru&#8208;CoP is relatively susceptible to the electrode potential compared to Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstruct a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network beween the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8208;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100 mA cm&#8208;2 @ ~538 mV).</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;nuclearity Luminescent Lanthanide Nanocages for Tumor Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an unmet need for easy&#8208;to&#8208;visualize drug carriers that can deliver therapeutic cargoes deep into solid tumors. Herein, we report the preparation of ultrasmall luminescent imine&#8208;based lanthanide nanocages, Eu60 and Tb60 (collectively Ln60), designed to encapsulate anticancer chemotherapeutics for tumor therapy. The as&#8208;prepared nanocages possess large cavities suitable for the encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX), yielding DOX@Ln60 nanocages with diameters around 5 nm. DOX@Ln60 are efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing the cells to be visualized via the intrinsic luminescent property of Ln(III). Once internalized, the acidic intracellular microenvironment promotes imine bond cleavage and the release of the loaded DOX. DOX@Ln60 inhibits DNA replication and triggers tumor cell apoptosis. In a murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, DOX@Ln60 was found to inhibit tumor growth with negligible side effects on normal tissues. It proved more effective than various controls, including DOX and Ln60. The present nanocages thus point the way to the development of precise nanomedicines for tumor imaging and therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>The Reverse of Electrostatic Interaction Force for Ultrahigh&#8208;Energy Al&#8208;Ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes with sufficient interlayer spacing are promising cathode materials for aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs), yet the electrostatic repulsion effect between the surface negative charges and the active anions (AlCl4&#8208;) hinders the intercalation of AlCl4&#8208; and is usually ignored. Here, we propose a charge regulation strategy for MXene cathodes to overcome this challenge. By doping N and Co, the zeta potential is gradually transformed from negative (Ti3C2Tx) to near&#8208;neutral (Ti3CNTx), and finally positive (Ti3CNTx@Co). Therefore, the electrostatic repulsion force can be greatly weakened between Ti3CNTx and AlCl4&#8208;, or even formed a strong electrostatic attraction between Ti3CNTx@Co and AlCl4&#8208;, which can not only accommodate more AlCl4&#8208; ions in the Ti3CNTx@Co interlayers to increase the capacity, but also solve the stacking and expansion problems. As a result, the optimized Al&#8208;MXene battery exhibits an ultrahigh capacity of up to 240 mAh g&#8208;1 (2&#8208;4 times the capacity of graphite cathode, 60&#8208;120 mAh g&#8208;1) and a potential ultrahigh energy density (432 Wh kg&#8208;1, 2&#8208;4 times the value of graphite, 110&#8208;220 Wh kg&#8208;1) based on the mass of cathode materials, comparable to LiFePO4&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries (350&#8208;450 Wh kg&#8208;1, based on the mass of LiFePO4).</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial LiF&#8208;Rich Interface Enabled by In&#8208;Situ Electrochemical Fluorination for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. One drawback of uncontrollable electrolyte degradation causes them to form a fragile and nonuniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI). In this study, we proposed a fluorinated carbon nanotube (CNT) macrofilm (CMF) on Li metal as a hybrid anode, which can regulate the redox state at anode/electrolyte interface. Due to the favorable reaction energy between plating Li and fluorinated CNTs, the metal can be fluorinated directly to a LiF&#8208;rich SEI during the charging process, leading to a high Young&#8217;s modulus (~2.0 GPa) and fast ionic transfer (~2.59&#215;10&#8211;7 S cm&#8211;1). The obtained SEI can guide the homogeneous plating/stripping of Li during electrochemical processes while suppressing dendrites growth. In particular, the hybrid endowed full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability allows for high&#8208;capacity retention (~99.3%) and remarkable rate capacity. This work can extend fluorination technology into a platform to control artificial SEI formation in Li&#8208;metal batteries giving it stability with long&#8208;life performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we discuss how nanocatalysts specifically regulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the tumor microenvironment, and the key is to use unique components or redox status in solid tumors to initiate catalytic reactions for selective release of immune regulators at the tumor site. The biological mechanism of nanocatalytic reaction in regulating antitumor immunity was discussed in detail and the prospects were prospected.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune&#8208;regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune&#8208;response activations by nanocatalytic medicine&#8208;initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti&#8208;tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potential and broad prospects of nanocatalysis&#8208;based anti&#8208;tumor immune&#8208;therapeutics.

         <title>Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte by Multivalent Low&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Penalty Design for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility in ester electrolytes and proposed a new multivalent low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design to achieve intrinsic LiNO3 solubilization. Linear esters with higher multivalency leads to more stable solvation structures and a monotonic increase in LiNO3 solubility of up to 0.8&#8197;M. Our findings offer new fundamental insights into the LiNO3 solvation chemistry.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a remarkable additive that can dramatically enhance the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at lithium metal anodes. However, it has long been constrained by its incompatibility with commercially used ester electrolytes. Herein, we correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility and proposed a new low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design that achieves high intrinsic LiNO3 solubility in ester solvents by employing multivalent linear esters. This strategy is conceptually different from the conventional enthalpic methods that relies on extrinsic high&#8208;polarity carriers. In this way, LiNO3 can directly interact with the primary ester solvents and fundamentally alters the electrolyte properties, resulting in substantial improvements in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. This work illustrates the significance of regulating the solvation entropy for high&#8208;performance electrolyte design.

         <title>Coupling Ferricyanide/Ferrocyanide Redox Mediated Recycling Spent LiFePO4 with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water electrolysis coupling spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox reaction realizes energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production at low electricity costs, while realizing spent LFP materials to value&#8208;added LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4 for cost&#8208;effective and environment&#8208;friendly recycling of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LFP batteries.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable alternative oxidation reactions offers a promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost&#8208;effective, environment&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; is low at 0.87&#8197;V. Operando Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;, thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4. The electrolyzer consumes 3.6&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 43&#8201;% less than conventional water electrolysis. Additionally, this recycling pathway for spent LFP batteries not only minimizes chemical consumption and prevents secondary pollution but also presents significant economic benefits.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Guangnanmycin A Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant ring strain has to be built up in pursuit of guangnanmycin A, a congener of the anticancer drug lead leinamycin. The challenge was met by liaising ring closing alkyne metathesis with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization. The signature disulfide was introduced by a thia&#8208;Michael addition reaction followed by an unusual thioether&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide swap. In the dense array, however, final oxidation of the primary alcohol was unsuccessful.







Abstract
Guangnanmycin A is a recently discovered congener of the well&#8208;known antitumor drug lead leinamycin; its macrolactam ring, however, is even more strained than that of the parent compound. The first synthetic foray towards this challenging target is reported, which relies on molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) followed by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of the propargyl alcohol thus formed; the resulting enone enabled the introduction of the yet missing exo&#8208;methylene group by a modified Peterson olefination. The signature disulfide moiety of guangnanmycin A was installed by strain&#8208;driven thia&#8208;Michael addition followed by conversion of the thioether thus formed into an unsymmetric disulfide with the aid of (methylthio)dimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate and MeSSMe. While this sequence furnished racemic guangnanmycin A alcohol in good overall yield, the final oxidation to the corresponding acid failed, most likely because of the exceptional sensitivity of the strained scaffold.

         <title>Helitwistacenes&#8212;Combining Lateral and Longitudinal Helicity Results in Solvent&#8208;Induced Inversion of Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining helicenes with twistacenes, in which the extent of twisting can be tuned, has led to the new family of helitwistacenes. The combination of lateral and longitudinal helicity results in polarity&#8208;induced and twisting&#8208;induced sign inversion of both the electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals. This sign inversion could be explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.







Abstract
Helicity is expressed differently in ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;fused acenes&#8212;helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent&#8208;induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.

         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the tandem BBr3&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of tertiary cyclic amine, intramolecular C&#8722;H borylation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular B&#8722;Br/C&#8722;Br reductive coupling was developed. This method represents a simple route to construct the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8722;H borylation, accessing the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.

         <title>Facile Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Crystallization Modulation for Large&#8208;area High&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br Films and Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrogen bonding&#8208;modulated crystallization strategy is developed to achieve highly&#8208;crystalline, uniform, and large&#8208;area CsPbI2Br films, enabling CsPbI2Br solar cells with record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under indoor illumination suggests its potential in the applications of powering the Internet of Things, etc.







Abstract
The thermally stable inorganic cesium&#8208;based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large&#8208;area black&#8208;phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen&#8208;bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large&#8208;area phase&#8208;pure films with much&#8208;reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant&#8208;free poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under 1000&#8197;lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.

         <title>Local Water Content in Polymer Gels Measured with Super&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous polymer systems play a key role in many applications and technological innovations. The fluorescence lifetime of a dye provides access to the number of water molecules in its vicinity, allowing the local water content of aqueous polymer networks to be studied with super&#8208;resolved fluorescence imaging. This method was applied to thermoresponsive microgels to study the water content in their swollen and collapsed state.







Abstract
Water molecules play an important role in the structure, function, and dynamics of (bio&#8208;)&#8201;materials. A direct access to the number of water molecules in nanoscopic volumes can thus give new molecular insights into materials and allow for fine&#8208;tuning their properties in sophisticated applications. The determination of the local water content has become possible by the finding that H2O quenches the fluorescence of red&#8208;emitting dyes. Since deuterated water, D2O, does not induce significant fluorescence quenching, fluorescence lifetime measurements performed in different H2O/D2O&#8208;ratios yield the local water concentration. We combined this effect with the recently developed fluorescence lifetime single molecule localization microscopy imaging (FL&#8208;SMLM) in order to nanoscopically determine the local water content in microgels, i.e. soft hydrogel particles consisting of a cross&#8208;linked polymer swollen in water. The change in water content of thermo&#8208;responsive microgels when changing from their swollen state at room temperature to a collapsed state at elevated temperature could be analyzed. A clear decrease in water content was found that was, to our surprise, rather uniform throughout the entire microgel volume. Only a slightly higher water content around the dye was found in the periphery with respect to the center of the swollen microgels.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules bearing chiral sulfur stereocenters exert a great impact on asymmetric catalysis and synthesis, chiral drugs, and chiral materials. Compared with acyclic ones, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of thio&#8208;heterocycles has largely lagged behind due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Here we establish the first modular platform to access chiral thio&#8208;oxazolidinones via Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] annulations of vinylethylene carbonates with sulfinylanilines. This protocol is featured by readily available starting materials, and high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. In particular, an unusual effect of a non&#8208;chiral supporting ligand on the diastereoselectivity was observed. Possible reaction mechanisms and stereocontrol models were proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are promising for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, these batteries are plagued by safety concerns due to the highly flammable nature of conventional electrolytes. Although nonflammable electrolytes eliminate the risk of fire, they often result in compromised battery performance due to poor compatibility with sodium metal anode and sulfur cathode. Herein, we develop an additive of tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2) in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes to improve the cycling stability of RT Na&#8211;S batteries via modulating the Na+ solvation environment and interface chemistry. The additive reduces the Na+ desolvation energy and enhances the electrolyte stability. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of Na&#8211;Sn alloy&#8208;based anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). These interphases help to suppress the growth of Na dendrites and the dissolution/shuttling of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), resulting in improved reversible capacity. Specifically, the Na&#8211;S battery with the designed electrolyte boosts the capacity from 322 to 906 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1. This study provides valuable insights for the development of safe and high&#8208;performance electrolytes in RT Na&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr Cross&#8208;Interfacial Electron Bridges to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off for Superdurable Bifunctional Single Atom Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#8710;E=0.70 V) and breakthrough durability including 100% current retention after 10 h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500 h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>PAM&#8208;Engineered Toehold Switches as Input&#8208;Responsive Activators of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The RNA&#8208;programmed CRISPR effector protein Cas12a has emerged as a powerful tool for gene editing and molecular diagnostics. However, additional bio&#8208;engineering strategies are required to achieve control over Cas12a activity. Here, we show that Toehold Switch DNA hairpins, presenting a rationally designed locked protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the loop, can be used to control Cas12a in response to molecular inputs. Reconfiguring the Toehold Switch DNA from a hairpin to a duplex conformation through a strand displacement reaction provides an effective means to modulate the accessibility of the PAM, thereby controlling the binding and cleavage activities of Cas12a. Through this approach, we showcase the potential to trigger downstream Cas12a activity by leveraging proximity&#8208;based strand displacement reactions in response to target binding. By utilizing the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a as a signal transduction method, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for sensing applications. Our system enables rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of IgG antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity even within complex matrices. Besides the bioanalytical applications, the switchable PAM&#8208;engineered Toehold Switches serve as programmable tools capable of regulating Cas12a&#8208;based targeting and DNA processing in response to molecular inputs and hold promise for a wide array of biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Regulated Cathode with Low Strain and Constraint Phase&#8208;Change Toward Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high&#8208;performance reversible Al&#8208;ions storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, metal organic frameworks, including Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs), severely suffers from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy&#8208;driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME&#8208;PBAs) host. By virtue of multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity and discharging voltage platform can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al ions storage. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M&#8208;N bond intensity, which is beneficial for achieving the constrain on phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME&#8208;PBA lattice parameters is varied in a range of only 1.2%. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells AIBs can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The entropy regulation strategy uncover the isochronous constrain on both strain and phase transition for long&#8208;term reversible Al3+ storage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods that could directly control the thiyl radical propagation is highly desirable yet remains challenging in modern polymer chemistry. Here, we reported the first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy, which utilizes allyl sulfides as chain transfer agents for reversibly deactivating the propagating thiyl radicals, thus allowing us to directly control a challenging thiyl radical chain polymerization to afford polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures. A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, high chain&#8208;end fidelity, and efficient chain extension proved good controllability of the polymerization. In addition, density functional theory calculations provided insight into the reversible deactivation ability of allyl sulfides. The SRAFT strategy developed in this work represents a promising platform for discovering new controlled polymerizations based on thiyl radical chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Applications of D&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives&#8208;based Metabolic Labeling of Bacterial Peptidoglycan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidoglycan, an essential component within the cell walls of virtually all bacteria, is composed of glycan strands linked by stem peptides that contain D&#8208;amino acids. The peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery exhibits high tolerance to various D&#8208;amino acid derivatives. D&#8208;amino acid derivatives with different functionalities can thus be specifically incorporated into and label the peptidoglycan of bacteria, but not the host mammalian cells. This metabolic labeling strategy is highly selective, highly biocompatible, and broadly applicable, which has been utilized in various fields. This review introduces the metabolic labeling strategies of peptidoglycan by using D&#8208;amino acid derivatives, including one&#8208;step and two&#8208;step strategies. In addition, we emphasize the various applications of D&#8208;amino acid derivative&#8208;based metabolic labeling, including bacterial peptidoglycan visualization (existence, biosynthesis, and dynamics, etc.), bacterial visualization (including bacterial imaging and visualization of growth and division, metabolic activity, antibiotic susceptibility, etc.), pathogenic bacteria&#8208;targeted diagnostics and treatment (positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, gas therapy, immunotherapy, etc.), and live bacteria&#8208;based therapy. Finally, a summary of this metabolic labeling and an outlook is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolved Readers of 5&#8208;Carboxylcytosine&#160;CpG Dyads Reveal a High Versatility of the Methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;Binding Domain for Recognition of Noncanonical Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5&#8208;methylation (mC), a total of four different 5&#8208;modifications can theoretically co&#8208;exist in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions, it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate readers of 5&#8208; carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;binding domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective, low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC&#8208; dyads. Together with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Truxene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Cages: Triple Interlocking and Supramolecular Chirogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating chiral elements in host&#8208;guest systems currently focuses much attention, which results from the major impact such structures may have onto a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to materials science and beyond. Moreover, the development of multi&#8208;responsive and &#8208;functional systems is highly desirable since they offer numerous benefits. In this context, we describe herein the construction of a metal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled cage that associates a chiral truxene&#8208;based ligand and a bis&#8208;ruthenium complex. The maximum separation between both facing chiral units in the assembly is fixed by the intermetallic distance within the lateral bis&#8208;ruthenium complex (8.4 &#197;). The resulting chiral cavity was shown to encapsulate polyaromatic guest molecules, but also to afford a chiral triply interlocked [2]catenane structure. The formation of the latter occurs at high concentration, while its disassembly could be achieved by addition of a planar achiral molecule. Interestingly the latter exhibits induced circular dichroism signature when trapped within the chiral cavity, demonstrating the cage ability for inducing supramolecular chirogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Structure&#8722;Activity Relationship Towards CO2 Electroreduction over SnO2 by A Standard Research Paradigm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Authentic surface structures under reaction conditions determine the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, therefore, the knowledge of the structure&#8722;activity relationship can facilitate the design of efficient catalyst structures for specific reactivity requirements. However, understanding the relationship between a more realistic active surface and its performance is challenging due to the complicated interface microenvironment in electrocatalysis. Herein, we proposed a standard research paradigm to effectively decipher the structure&#8722;activity relationship in electrocatalysis, which is exemplified in the CO2 electroreduction over SnO2. The proposed practice has aided in discovering authentic/resting surface states (Sn layer) of SnO2 accountable for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance under electrocatalytic conditions, which then is corroborated in the subsequent CO2RR experiments over SnO2 with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoparticles, and nanosheets) in combination with in&#8722;situ characterizations. This proposed methodology is further extended to the SnO electrocatalysts, providing helpful insights into catalytic structures. It is believed that our proposed standard research paradigm is also applicable to other electrocatalytic systems, in the meantime, decreases the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and accelerates the design of catalyst structures that achieve sustainable performance for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Mining the Metabolic Capacity of Clostridium sporogenes Aided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anaerobes dominate the microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where a significant portion of small molecules can be degraded or modified. However, the enormous metabolic capacity of gut anaerobes remains largely elusive in contrast to aerobic bacteria, mainly due to the requirement of sophisticated laboratory settings. In this study, we employed an in&#8208;silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, to predict the metabolic capacity of a gut anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes, against small molecules. Experiments revealed that among the top seven candidates predicted as unstable, six indeed exhibited instability in C. sporogenes culture. We further identified several metabolites resulting from the supplementation of everolimus in the bacterial culture for the first time. By utilizing bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays, we successfully identified an enzyme encoded in the genome of C. sporogenes responsible for everolimus transformation. Our framework thus can potentially facilitate future understanding of small molecules metabolism in the gut, further improve patient care through personalized medicine, and guide the development of new small molecule drugs and therapeutic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of stilbene pairs in a DNA duplex mediated by ruthenium photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of orthogonal photoresponsive systems for use in photochemistry, biochemistry and other fields has proven challenging. We herein report a method for site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of a DNA duplex. A stilbene pair was introduced into a DNA duplex and a ruthenium complex was conjugated with a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide. We demonstrated that [2+2] photocycloaddition of the stilbene pair occurred upon irradiation visible light when the ruthenium complex was in close proximity due to triplex formation. No reaction occurred when the ruthenium complex was not in proximity to the stilbene pair. The wavelength of visible light used was of lower energy than the wavelength of UV light necessary for direct excitation of stilbene. Quantum chemical calculation indicated that ruthenium complex catalyzed the photocycloaddition via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site selectivity of this photo&#8208;crosslinking system was evaluated using a DNA duplex bearing two stilbene pairs as a substrate; we showed that the site of crosslinking was precisely regulated by the sequence of the oligonucleotide linked to the ruthenium complex. Since this method does not require orthogonal photoresponsive molecules, it will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) serves as an essential coenzyme for DNA synthesis and has diverse biological functions. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in mammals. Herein, the first chemical tool for optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems was developed using the photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PS&#8208;PROTACs) strategy. NAMPT activator and dimethylpyrazolazobenzene photoswitch was innovatively used to design highly efficient PS&#8208;PROTACs, enabling up&#8208; and down&#8208; reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+ in a light&#8208;dependent manner and reduced the toxicity associated with inhibitor&#8208;based PS&#8208;PROTACs. Interestingly, the PS&#8208;PROTAC could be activated under the 620 nm irradiation, realizing in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT and NAD+.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Vinyl Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azetidines, being four&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value&#8208;added 2&#8208;alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step&#8208;economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in&#8208;situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate. Experimental investigations, coupled with computational studies, suggest that a diradical pathway is involved in the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Functional Small Molecules into Nanoparticles: Assembly&#160;and Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecules, including therapeutic drugs and tracer molecules, play a vital role in biological processing, disease treatment and diagnosis, and have inspired various nanobiotechnology approaches to realize their biological function, particularly in drug delivery. Desirable features of a delivery system for functional small molecules (FSMs) include high biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and simple manufacturing processes, without the need for chemical modification of the FSM itself. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and versatile approach, based on metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;mediated assembly, for assembling FSMs into nanoparticles (i.e., FSM&#8208;MPN NPs) under aqueous and ambient conditions. We demonstrate loading of anticancer drugs, latency reversal agents, and fluorophores at up to ~80% that is mostly facilitated by &#960; and hydrophobic interactions between the FSM and nanoparticle components. Secondary nanoparticle engineering involving coating with a polyphenol&#8211;antibody thin film or sequential co&#8208;loading of multiple FSMs enables cancer cell targeting and combination delivery, respectively. Incorporating fluorophores into FSM&#8208;MPN NPs enables the visualization of biodistribution at different time points, revealing that most of these NPs are retained in the kidney and heart 24 h post intravenous administration. This work provides a viable pathway for the rational design of small molecule nanoparticle delivery platforms for diverse biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Review and Theoretical Analysis of Fluorinated Radicals in Direct CAr&#8211;H Functionalization of (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We highlight key contributions in the field of direct radical CAr&#8211;H (hetero)aromatic functionalization involving fluorinated radicals. A compilation of Functional Group Transfer Reagents and their diverse activation mechanisms leading to the release of radicals are discussed. The substrate scope for each radical is analyzed and classified into three categories according to the electronic properties of the substrates. Density functional theory computational analysis provides insights into the chemical reactivity of several fluorinated radicals through their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity parameters. Theoretical analysis of their reduction potentials also highlights the remarkable correlation between electrophilicity and oxidizing ability. It is also established that highly fluorinated radicals (e.g.&#8226;OCF3) are capable of engaging in single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes rather than radical addition, which is in good agreement with experimental literature data. A reactivity scale, based on activation barrier of addition of these radicals to benzene is also elaborated using the high accuracy DLPNO&#8208;(U)CCSD(T) method.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Specific Dual Modification of Peptides through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific introduction of multiple components into peptides is greatly needed for the preparation of densely functionalized and structurally uniform peptides. In this regard, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific peptide modification is attractive, but it can be difficult due to the presence of highly nucleophilic lysine &#949;&#8208;amine. In this work, we developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of iminopeptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#949;&#8208;amine, thus affording the cycloadducts in excellent yields. Tolerating a broad range of functional groups and molecules, the present method provides the opportunity to rapidly construct doubly functionalized peptides using readily accessible aldehyde and maleimide modules.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Degradable Oxygen&#8208;Rich Polymers with AB/ABB Units from Fast and Selective Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Researchers have been chasing plastics that can automatically and fully degrade into valuable products under natural conditions. Here, we develop a series of water&#8208;degradable polymers from the first reported fast and selective cationic copolymerization of formaldehyde (B) with cyclic anhydrides (A). In addition to readily accessible monomers, the method is performed at industrially relevant temperatures (~100 &#176;C), takes tens or even minutes, and uses common acid as the catalyst. Interestingly, such polymers possess tunable AB/ABB&#8208;type repeating units, which are considered to be thermodynamic and kinetic products, respectively, resulting in low carbon content ([O]:[C] up to 1:1). Notably, the polymers can completely degrade to valuable diacids within 150 days in water at ambient temperature owing to the incorporation of carboxyl terminals and acid&#8208;responsive acetal units. By washing with aqueous sodium carbonate, the polymers are relatively stable over several months.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) CpxRh(III) catalysis has been demonstrated to be competent for catalyzing highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and nitrene sources. The chiral CpxRh(III) catalysis system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance and wide functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 93% ee). This protocol presents a novel and effective strategy for synthesizing enantioenriched aziridines from simple alkenes. Various transformations were performed on the aziridine products, illustrating the versatility and synthetic potential of this protocol for constructing highly functionalized compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Arylketone Oxime Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the development of palladium&#8208;catalyzed deacylative deuteration of arylketone oxime ethers. This protocol features excellent functional group tolerance, heterocyclic compatibility, and high deuterium incorporation levels. Regioselective deuteration of some biologically important drugs and natural products are showcased via Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation and subsequent deacylative deuteration. Vicinal meta&#8208;C&#8211;H bond functionalization (including fluorination, arylation, and alkylation) and para&#8208;C&#8211;H bond deuteration of electro&#8208;rich arenes are realized by using the ketone as both directing group and leaving group, which is distinct from aryl halide in conventional dehalogenative deuteration.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Stimuli&#8208;Responsive [2]Rotaxanes with Tunable Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission and Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at the construction of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent system with precisely tunable emissions, the typical&#160;9,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,14&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a, c]phenazine (DPAC)&#160;luminogen&#160;with attractive vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) behavior has been introduced into [2]rotaxane as a stopper. Taking advantage of their unique dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness towards&#160;solvent and anion, the resultant [2]rotaxanes reveal both tunable VIE and switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Attributed to the formation of mechanical bonds, DPAC&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxanes display interesting VIE behaviors including white&#8208;light emission upon the addition of viscous solvent, as evaluated in detail by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra. In addition, ascribed to the regulation of chirality information transmission through anion&#8208;induced motions of chiral wheel, the resolved chiral [2]rotaxanes reveal unique switchable CPL upon the addition of anion, leading to significant increase in the dissymmetry factors (glum) values with excellent reversibility. Interestingly, upon doping the chiral [2]rotaxanes in stretchable polymer, the blend films reveal remarkable emission change from white light to light blue with significant 6.5&#8208;fold increase in glum values up to &#8208;0.035 under external tensile stresses. This work provides not only a new design strategy for developing molecular systems with fluorescent tunability but also a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective C&#8208;H Halogenation of Alkenes and Alkynes Using Flavin&#8208;Dependent Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single component flavin&#8208;dependent halogenases (FDHs) possesses both flavin reductase and FDH activity in a single enzyme. We recently reported that the single component FDH AetF catalyzes site&#8208;selective bromination and iodination of a variety of aromatic substrates and enantioselective bromolactonization and iodoetherification of styrenes bearing pendant carboxylic acid or alcohol substituents. Given this inherent reactivity and selectivity, we explored the utility of AetF as catalyst for alkene and alkyne C&#8208;H halogenation. We find that AetF catalyzes halogenation of a range of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted styrenes, often with high stereoselectivity.&#160;Despite the utility of haloalkenes for cross&#8208;coupling and other applications, accessing these compounds in a stereoselective manner typically requires functional group interconversion processes, and selective halogenation of 1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted olefins remains rare.&#160;We also establish that AetF and homologues of this enzyme can halogenate terminal alkynes. Mutagenesis studies and deuterium kinetic isotope effects are used to support a mechanistic proposal involving covalent catalysis for halogenation of unactivated alkynes by AetF homologues. These findings expand the scope of FDH catalysis and continue to show the unique utility of single component FDHs for biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Salts: Their Porous Network Diversification and Construction of Chiral Helical Luminescent Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic salts (POSs) are organic porous materials assembled via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between strong acids and bases such as sulfonic acids and amines. To diversify the network topology of POSs and extend its functions, this study focused on using 4,4',4'',4'''&#8208;(9,9'&#8208;spirobi[fluorene]&#8208;2,2',7,7'&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzenesulfonic acid (spiroBPS), which is a tetrasulfonic acid comprising a square planar skeleton. The POS consisting of spiroBPS and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) (spiroBPS/TPMA) was constructed from the two&#8208;fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with pts topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Cl) and tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Br), which are bulkier than TPMA owing to the introduction of halogens at the p&#8208;position of the phenyl groups with spiroBPS allows us to construct novel POSs (spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl and spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Br). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with pth topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl with pth topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Species Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) thin films are obtained by reconstructing perovskite surface with GASCN/NaSCN. This surface reconstruction can repair surface defects of PNC, maintain the integrity of crystal structure, and suppress F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, thus enabling highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) solution has exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the luminance would be severely quenched when the PNC solution is assembled into thin films due to the agglomeration and fusion of NCs caused by the exfoliation of surface ligands and non&#8208;radiative F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from small to large particle sizes, which seriously affected the performances of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we used Guanidine thiocyanate (GASCN) and Sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) to achieve effective CsPbI3 PNC surface reconstruction. Due to the strong coordination ability of these small molecules with the anions and cations on the surface of the PNCs, they can provide strong surface protection against PNC fusion during centrifugal purification process and repair the surface defects of PNCs, so that the original uniform size distribution of PNCs can be maintained and FRET between close&#8208;packed PNC films is effectively suppressed, which allows the emission characteristics of the films to be preserved. As a result, highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free high&#8208;quality PNC thin films are obtained, with PLQY as high as 95.1&#8201;%, far exceeding that of the original film, and corresponding LEDs exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Engineering Hydroxylase Activity, Selectivity, and Stability for a Scalable Concise Synthesis of a Key Intermediate to Belzutifan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic oxidations are an emerging technology for selective C&#8208;H bond activation. While promising for a range of selective oxidations, practical use of enzymes catalyzing aerobic hydroxylation is presently limited by their substrate scope and stability under industrially relevant conditions. Here, we report the engineering and practical application of a non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase for the direct stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective hydroxylation of a non&#8208;native fluoroindanone en route to the oncology treatment belzutifan, replacing a five&#8208;step chemical synthesis with a direct enantioselective hydroxylation. Mechanistic studies indicated that formation of the desired product was limited by enzyme stability and product overoxidation, with these properties subsequently improved by directed evolution, yielding a biocatalyst capable of &gt;15,000 total turnovers. Highlighting the industrial utility of this biocatalyst, the high&#8208;yielding, green, and efficient oxidation was demonstrated at kilogram scale for the synthesis of belzutifan.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Crystallinity Mismatch Between Donor and Acceptor to Improve Exciton/Charge Transport in Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4&#8208;C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.







Abstract
Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap&#8208;assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Hence, a facile strategy is proposed to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor by incorporating a novel multifunctional liquid crystal small molecule (LCSM) BDTPF4&#8208;C6 into the binary blend. BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is the first LCSM based on a tetrafluorobenzene unit and features a low liquid crystal phase transition temperature and strong self&#8208;assembly ability, conducive to regulating the active layer morphology. When BDTPF4&#8208;C6 is introduced as a guest molecule into the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 binary, it exhibits better compatibility with the donor PM6 and primarily resides within the PM6 phase because of the similarity&#8208;intermiscibility principle. Moreover, systematic studies revealed that BDTPF4&#8208;C6 could be used as a seeding agent for PM6 to enhance its crystallinity, thereby forming a more balanced and favourable charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was observed between the guest molecule and the host donor and acceptor, resulting in an improved current density. This study demonstrates a facile approach to balance the charge mobilities and offers new insights into boosting the efficiency of single&#8208;junction OSCs beyond 20&#8201;%.

         <title>A Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gigantic transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated polyoxometalate cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers was obtained and used for enhanced brain&#8208;targeted glioma therapy for the first time.







Abstract
Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0&#8197;nm &#215; 6.0&#8197;nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate the apoptosis pathway of glioma cells with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66&#8197;&#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanical Properties of 3D&#8208;printed Objects by the RAFT Process: From Chain&#8208;Growth to Step&#8208;Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of xanthate&#8208;based RAFT agent and vinyl acetate&#8208;based monomer was developed and applied in photoinduced 3D printing, presenting a facile way to tune the mechanical properties of the printed objects.







Abstract
Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step&#8208;growth to chain&#8208;growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young's moduli, ranging from 7.6&#8197;MPa to 997.1&#8197;MPa. Moreover, post&#8208;functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with specific and tunable properties.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100&#8201;% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice Cl&#8722; cyclic process of Co2(OH)3Cl was demonstrated to facilitate photoelectrochemical Cl&#8722; oxidative Cl2 generation in a salt electrolyte. The on&#8208;site produced HClO, by reacting Cl2 with H2O, can be a mediator to oxidize various alkenes to generate the corresponding epoxides with conversion ratios and selectivities of almost 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl&#8722; of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and be spontaneously recovered by Cl&#8722; of a salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100&#8201;% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8722;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120&#8197;hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.

         <title>Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid&#8208;state Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are attractive due to their greener reaction conditions, and ability to yield unique products. Such reactions are feasible when the reacting groups are pre&#8208;organized in the crystal. We present a crystal that avoids a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement but reacts after a massive molecular motion leading to an unexpected product. This alerts that one has to be cautious in predicting the topochemical reactions based on crystal packing.







Abstract
We designed a proline&#8208;derived monomer with azide and alkene functional groups to enable topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization. In its crystal, the monomer forms supramolecular helices along the &#8216;a&#8217; axis through various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Along the &#8216;c&#8217; axis, the molecules arrange themselves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail in a wave&#8208;like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti&#8208;parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.

     alt="Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid-state Polymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topochemical reactions are attractive due to their greener reaction conditions, and ability to yield unique products. Such reactions are feasible when the reacting groups are pre-organized in the crystal. We present a crystal that avoids a ready-to-react arrangement but reacts after a massive molecular motion leading to an unexpected product. This alerts that one has to be cautious in predicting the topochemical reactions based on crystal packing.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sulfonated Perylene as Three&#8208;in&#8208;One STING Agonist for Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study states that sulfonated perylene can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist that not only promotes the production of endogenous cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) but also inhibits its hydrolysis as well as achieves lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and hence presents an innovative platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) has been considered as a powerful immunotherapy strategy. While promising, the clinical translation of CDNs is still overwhelmed by its limited biostability and the resulting systemic immunotoxicity. Being differentiating from current application of exogenous CDNs to address these challenges, we herein developed one perylene STING agonist PDIC&#8208;NS, which not only promotes the production of endogenous CDNs but also inhibits its hydrolysis. More significantly, PDIC&#8208;NS can well reach lung&#8208;selective enrichment, and thus mitigates the systemic immunotoxicity upon intravenous administration. As a result, PDIC&#8208;NS had realized remarkable in vivo antitumor activity, and backward verified on STING knock out mice. Overall, this study states that PDIC&#8208;NS can function as three&#8208;in&#8208;one small&#8208;molecule STING agonist characterized by promoting the content and biostability of endogenous CDNs as well as possessing good tissue specificity, and hence presents an innovative strategy and platform for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Polar Perovskites for Highly Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polar perovskite MhyPbBr3 (Mhy=methylhydrazine), combining the merits of the excellent charge transition and bulk photovoltage effect, realized a sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection with a high sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The work first reports the unprecedented radiation photovoltage and efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D classic organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, shedding light on future practical applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have achieved tremendous success in direct X&#8208;ray detection due to their high absorption coefficient and excellent carrier transport. However, owing to the centrosymmetry of classic 3D structures, these reported X&#8208;ray detectors mostly require external electrical fields to run, resulting in bulky overall circuitry, high energy consumption, and operational instability. Herein, we first report the unprecedented radiation photovoltage in 3D OIHP for efficient self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. Specifically, the 3D polar OIHP MhyPbBr3 (1, Mhy=methylhydrazine) shows an intrinsic radiation photovoltage (0.47&#8197;V) and large mobility&#8208;lifetime product (1.1&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, these excellent physical characteristics endow 1 with sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection performance, showing a considerable sensitivity of 220&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which surpasses those of most self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detectors. This work first explores highly sensitive self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection in 3D polar OIHPs, shedding light on future practical applications.

         <title>Leveraging Expertise in Thermal Catalysis to Understand Plasma Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Scientific Perspective outlines best practice in the design of plasma catalysis experiments. A water pumping model depicts the limitations of an exergonic reaction that surpasses thermodynamic equilibrium, where the pump represents the plasma. The leak back causes energy dissipation, depending on the water level in the upper reservoir (representing conversion) and the size of the leak (representing plasma activation of the product).







Abstract
Best practices in testing heterogeneous catalysts are translated to plasma&#8208;catalytic experiments. Independent determination of plasma&#8208;catalytic and plasma&#8208;chemical contributions is essential. Non&#8208;porous catalyst particles are preferred because active sites inside sub&#8208;micron pores cannot contribute. Temperature variation is needed to determine kinetics, despite the complexity of thermal effects in plasma. Rigorous checks on catalyst deactivation and mass balance are needed. Plasma enhanced reversed reactions should be minimized by keeping conversion low and far from thermodynamic equilibrium, preventing underestimation of the rate of forward reaction. In contrast, plasma&#8208;catalytic studies often aim at conversions surpassing thermodynamic equilibrium, not obtaining any information on kinetics. Calculation of catalyst activity per active sites (turn&#8208;over&#8208;frequency) requires also appropriate characterization to determine the number of active sites.The relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics for plasma&#8208;catalysis is discussed using endothermic decomposition of CO2 and exothermic synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2 as examples. Assuming Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanisms, the effect of excitation of reactant molecules on activation barriers and surface coverages are discussed, influencing reaction rates. The consequences of reversed reactions are considered. Plasma&#8208;catalysis with catalysts applied for thermal catalysis at much higher temperature should be avoided, as adsorbed species are bonded too strongly resulting in low rates.

         <title>Nitrogenous Intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly evolving field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalysis encompasses various processes, ranging from green NH3 synthesis and the construction of C&#8722;N bonds with small molecules to the synthesis of nitrogenous compounds with unconventional oxidation states. The review aims to provide insights into recent progress, research methodologies, and prospective avenues for the regulated generation and in situ utilization of nitrogenous intermediates.







Abstract
Chemical manufacturing utilizing renewable sources and energy emerges as a promising path towards sustainability and carbon neutrality. The electrocatalytic reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) offered a potential strategy for synthesizing various nitrogenous chemicals. However, it is currently hindered by low selectivity/efficiency and limited reaction pathways, mainly due to the difficulties in controllable generation and utilization of nitrogenous intermediates. In this minireview, focusing on nitrogenous intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions, we discuss newly developed methodologies for studying and controlling the generation, conversion, and utilizing of nitrogenous intermediates, which enable recent developments in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions that yield various products, including ammonia (NH3), organonitrogen molecules, and nitrogenous compounds exhibiting unconventional oxidation states. Furthermore, we also make an outlook to highlight future directions in the emerging field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, amines and amides over heterogeneous photocatalysts including inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) photocatalysts.







Abstract
Activation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is extremely attractive but remains a great challenge. Heterogeneous photocatalysis offers a promising and sustainable approach for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and has been fast developing in the past decade. This Minireview focuses on mechanism and strategies for heterogeneous photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. After introducing mechanistic insights, heterogeneous photocatalytic strategies for C(sp3)&#8722;H activation including precise design of active sites, regulation of reactive radical species, improving charge separation and reactor innovations are discussed. In addition, recent advances in C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, amines and amides by heterogeneous photocatalysis are summarized. Lastly, challenges and opportunities are outlined to encourage more efforts for the development of this exciting and promising field.

         <title>Enhanced Directed Evolution in Mammalian Cells Yields a Hyperefficient Pyrrolysyl tRNA for Noncanonical Amino Acid Mutagenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. Using an optimized virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution Scheme in mammalian cells, an enhanced variant of the M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA, PyOtR, was developed. PyOtR enabled improved incorporation of many noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins expressed in mammalian cells, and enabled facile generation of cell lines stably expressing the ncAA incorporation machinery.







Abstract
Heterologous tRNAs used for noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells typically show poor activity. We recently introduced a virus&#8208;assisted directed evolution strategy (VADER) that can enrich improved tRNA mutants from na&#239;ve libraries in mammalian cells. However, VADER was limited to processing only a few thousand mutants; the inability to screen a larger sequence space precluded the identification of highly active variants with distal synergistic mutations. Here, we report VADER2.0, which can process significantly larger mutant libraries. It also employs a novel library design, which maintains base&#8208;pairing between distant residues in the stem regions, allowing us to pack a higher density of functional mutants within a fixed sequence space. VADER2.0 enabled simultaneous engineering of the entire acceptor stem of M.&#8197;mazei pyrrolysyl tRNA (tRNAPyl), leading to a remarkably improved variant, which facilitates more efficient incorporation of a wider range of ncAAs, and enables facile development of viral vectors and stable cell&#8208;lines for ncAA mutagenesis.

         <dc:description>Making oppositely charged metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) into a tightly ordered structure may bring interesting functions. Herein, we report a novel structure composed of anionic (Zr4L6)8&#8722; (L=embonate) tetrahedral cages and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed cationic [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ (Bim=[BH(im)3]&#8722;; im=imidazole) cubic cages. Chiral transfer is observed from enantiopure (Zr4L6)8&#8722; cage to enantiopure [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ cage. A pair of enantiomers (PTC&#8208;373(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;373(&#923;)) are formed. PTC&#8208;373 exhibits high chemical and thermal stabilities, affording an interesting single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. More importantly, the combination of ionic pair cages significantly enhances its third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property, and its thin&#8208;film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Platform Approach to Cleavable Macrocycles for the Controlled Disassembly of Mechanically Caged Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by interlocked oligonucleotides, peptides and knotted proteins, synthetic systems where a macrocycle cages a bioactive species that is &#8220;switched on&#8221; by breaking the mechanical bond have been reported. However, to date, each example uses a bespoke chemical design. Here we present a platform approach to mechanically caged structures wherein a single macrocycle precursor is diversified at a late stage to include a range of trigger units that control ring opening in response to enzymatic, chemical, or photochemical stimuli. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable to other classes of macrocycles suitable for rotaxane and catenane formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Efficient Single Metal Atom Biocatalysts at the Atomic Structure Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we highlight the design of single metal atom catalysts at the atomic structure level by focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss their biological catalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Various nanomaterials as biocatalysts could be custom&#8208;designed and modified to precisely match the specific microenvironment of diseases, showing a promise in achieving effective therapy outcomes. Compared to conventional biocatalysts, single metal atom catalysts (SMACs) with maximized atom utilization through well&#8208;defined structures offer enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. Currently, there is still a gap in a comprehensive overview of the connection between structures and biocatalytic mechanisms of SMACs. Therefore, it is crucial to deeply investigate the role of SMACs in biocatalysis from the atomic structure level and to elucidate their potential mechanisms in biocatalytic processes. In this minireview, we summarize catalysis regulation methods of SMACs at the atomic structure level, focusing on the optimization of catalytic active sites, coordination environment, and active site&#8208;support interactions, and briefly discuss biocatalytic mechanisms for biomedical applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry was combined with in&#8208;source fragmentation to visualize fragmentation pathways of biopolymers in a three&#8208;dimensional data domain (Precursor m/z, Product m/z, Intensity). By connecting the experimental points in a stairstep pattern, with the diagonal line where the precursor and product m/z values are equal defining the edge of each stair, the sequence of the biopolymer could be reconstructed.







Abstract
Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharide or peptide ions prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule's MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.

         <title>Controllable Assembly of Highly Oxidized Cobalt on Graphdiyne Surface for Efficient Conversion of Nitrogen into Nitric Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation highly oxidized metal species in C(sp)&#8208;rich graphdiyne, nitrogen can selectively and efficiently be converted into *NO, the key intermediate towards nitric acid synthesis. In summary, nitrogen is converted into nitric acid in high yield and good Faraday efficiency







Abstract
The manufacture of nitric acid (HNO3) consumes large amounts of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. Electrochemical synthesis is regarded as a key way to eliminate carbon emissions from the chemicals industry. The selective electrosynthesis of HNO3 from nitrogen was achieved by controllable assembly of cobalt metal on graphdiyne surface using a powerful tool of electrochemistry at ambient conditions. As an advanced material, graphdiyne (GDY) has a large conjugated structure on its surface and is rich in sp&#8208;C triple bond skeleton, which can achieve strong interaction with metal atoms, resulting in incomplete charge transfer between graphdiyne and cobalt atoms. The experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the highly oxidized cobalt on graphdiyne (HOCo/GDY) can selectively and efficiently activate and convert the nitrogen into the key intermediate *NO, which promotes the efficient overall conversion performance of nitrogen to nitric acid. Thus, the highest nitric acid yield (192.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (21.5&#8201;%) were achieved at low potentials.

         <title>Hygroscopic Solutes Enable Non&#8208;van der Waals Electrolytes for Fire&#8208;Tolerant Dual&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the irreversible thermal transformation of electrolytes is typically attributed to solvent boiling, which disrupts solvent intermolecular interactions, our research revealed that hygroscopic solutes shift the determining factor to solute decomposition, breaking solute intramolecular bonds. As intramolecular bonds are much stronger, it enables ultrahigh thermal tolerance of non&#8208;van der Waals solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes.







Abstract
Thermal safety issues of batteries have hindered their large&#8208;scale applications. Nonflammable electrolytes improved safety but solvent evaporation above 100&#8201;&#176;C limited thermal tolerance, lacking reliability. Herein, fire&#8208;tolerant metal&#8208;air batteries were realized by introducing solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes whose hygroscopic solutes could spontaneously reabsorb the evaporated water solvent. Using Zn/CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air/carbon batteries as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, they failed upon burning at 631.8&#8201;&#176;C but self&#8208;recovered then by reabsorbing water from the air at room temperature. Different from conventional aqueous electrolytes whose irreversible thermal transformation is determined by the boiling points of solvents, solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes make this transformation determined by the much higher decomposition temperature of solutes. It was found that stronger intramolecular bonds instead of intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions were strongly correlated to ultra&#8208;high tolerance temperatures of our solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes. Our study would improve the understanding of the thermal properties of electrolytes, guide the design of solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, and enhance battery safety.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Determination of the Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Ground State of Tridecacene
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tridecacenes were synthesized on Au(111) and their properties were characterized by combined scanning tunneling spectroscopy, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many body calculations. The study confirmed the open&#8208;shell diradical character and demonstrated that the magnitude of the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap is affected by the proximity of the surface as well as a dynamic electron correlation.







Abstract
The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion. However, convincing experimental evidence of their open&#8208;shell character has so far been missing. Here, we present the on&#8208;surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126&#8197;meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many&#8208;body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine Learning models were trained on the antibacterial activity of 288 ruthenium&#8208;arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and utilised to predict novel compounds based on a virtual library. 54 new compounds were synthesised and found to possess a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate compared to the training set.







Abstract
Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7&#8201;%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4&#8201;%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;18 Labeling Reveals a Mixed Fe&#8722;O Mechanism in the Last Step of Cytochrome P450 51 Sterol 14&#945;&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 51 enzymes demethylate sterols, releasing formic acid (DCOOH). Analysis of the DCOOH by&#8208;product enables the mechanistic discrimination of the contribution(s) of Compound 0 (Cpd 0) and Compound I (Cpd I) to catalysis. When enzyme reactions were run under 18O2 (red), &gt;50&#8201;% of the DCOOH yielded contained one atom of 18O (for all P450 51 enzymes tested), indicative of the major contribution of Cpd 0 in 24,25&#8208;dihydrolanosterol C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
The 14&#945;&#8208;demethylation step is critical in eukaryotic sterol biosynthesis, catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (P450) Family 51 enzymes, for example, with lanosterol in mammals. This conserved three&#8208;step reaction terminates in a C&#8722;C cleavage step that generates formic acid, the nature of which has been controversial. Proposed mechanisms involve roles of P450 Compound 0 (ferric peroxide anion, FeO2&#8722;) or Compound I (perferryl oxygen, FeO3+) reacting with either the aldehyde or its hydrate, respectively. Analysis of 18O incorporation into formic acid from 18O2 provides a means of distinguishing the two mechanisms. Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88&#8201;% 18O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO2&#8722; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen atom 3.5&#8197;&#197; away from the heme iron atom. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H218O yielded primarily one 18O atom but 14&#8201;% of the formic acid product with two 18O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8211;MS evidence for a Compound 0&#8208;derived Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;&#8208;formyl ester) was also found.

Human P450 51A1 incorporated 88&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O (one atom) into formic acid, consistent with a major but not exclusive FeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; mechanism. Two P450 51 orthologs from amoeba and yeast showed similar results, while two orthologs from pathogenic trypanosomes showed roughly equal contributions of both mechanisms. An X-ray crystal structure of the human enzyme showed the aldehyde oxygen atom 3.5&#8197;&#197; away from the heme iron atom. Experiments with human P450 51A1 and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O yielded primarily one &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O atom but 14&#8201;% of the formic acid product with two &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O atoms, indicative of a minor contribution of a Compound I mechanism. LC&#8211;MS evidence for a Compound 0-derived Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction product (a 14&#945;-formyl ester) was also found.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization, short pH&#8208;responsive peptides are embedded into the main chain of vinylic polymers. Controlled by pH, these defined peptide sequences dictate the reversible folding of their parent polymers into hydrogen&#8208;bonded architectures, effectively mirroring the translation from primary to higher&#8208;order structures.







Abstract
Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208;driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide&#8208;N,N&#8208;Dimethylacrylamide copolymers via radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence&#8208;defined regions of &#946;&#8208;sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self&#8208;assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.

         <title>Acetamide Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrite in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen waste species in water. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime, an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide over copper catalysts under alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Renewable electricity driven electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising solution to carbon neutralization, which mainly generate simple carbon products. It is of great importance to produce more valuable C&#8722;N chemicals from CO2 and nitrogen species. However, it is challenging to co&#8208;reduce CO2 and NO3&#8722;/NO2&#8722; to generate aldoxime an important intermediate in the electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process. Herein, we report the successful electrochemical conversion of CO2 and NO2&#8722; to acetamide for the first time over copper catalysts under alkaline condition through a gas diffusion electrode. Operando spectroelectrochemical characterizations and DFT calculations, suggest acetaldehyde and hydroxylamine identified as key intermediates undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction to produce acetaldoxime, which is then dehydrated to acetonitrile and followed by hydrolysis to give acetamide under highly local alkaline environment and electric field. Moreover, the above mechanism was successfully extended to the formation of phenylacetamide. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize highly valued amides from CO2 and wastewater.

         <title>Rational Design of Dinitroxide Polarizing Agents for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization to Enhance Overall NMR Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eighteen nitroxide biradicals for DNP&#8208;enhanced solid&#8208;state NMR are compared at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. Among the best performing radicals, the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains often compete with each other leading to very similar overall performance across a range of biradicals. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, works well in both organic and aqueous solvents, making it a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.







Abstract
We evaluate the overall sensitivity gains provided by a series of eighteen nitroxide biradicals for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR at 9.4&#8197;T and 100&#8197;K, including eight new biradicals. We find that in the best performing group the factors contributing to the overall sensitivity gains, namely the DNP enhancement, the build&#8208;up time, and the contribution factor, often compete with each other leading to very similar overall sensitivity across a range of biradicals. NaphPol and HydroPol are found to provide the best overall sensitivity factors, in organic and aqueous solvents respectively. One of the new biradicals, AMUPolCbm, provides high sensitivity for all three solvent formulations measured here, and can be considered to be a &#8220;universal&#8221; polarizing agent.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Chirality in ClMBA2SnI4 2D Perovskite
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Sn&#8208;based 2D chiral perovskite ClMBA2SnI4 is reported showing appealing optical properties with a low band gap and a broad emission centered in the red part of the spectrum. Computational modelling describes both the chiral transfer effect on the band structure and the origin of broad emission. Preliminary correlations between the nature of chiral ligand and central atom on the chiroptical response of chiral perovskites are proposed.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites possess a huge applicative potential in several areas of optoelectronics and spintronics. The development of novel lead&#8208;free perovskites with tunable properties is a key topic of current research. Herein, we report a novel lead&#8208;free chiral perovskite, namely (R/S&#8722;)ClMBA2SnI4 (ClMBA=1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanamine) and the corresponding racemic system. ClMBA2SnI4 samples exhibit a low band gap (2.12&#8197;eV) together with broad emission extending in the red region of the spectrum (&#8764;1.7&#8197;eV). Chirality transfer from the organic ligand induces chiroptical activity in the 465&#8211;530&#8197;nm range. Density functional theory calculations show a Rashba type band splitting for the chiral samples and no band splitting for the racemic isomer. Self&#8208;trapped exciton formation is at the origin of the large Stokes shift in the emission. Careful correlation with analogous lead and lead&#8208;free 2D chiral perovskites confirms the role of the symmetry&#8208;breaking distortions in the inorganic layers associated with the ligands as the source of the observed chiroptical properties providing also preliminary structure&#8208;property correlation in 2D chiral perovskites.

A patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model to rapidly, precisely and individually evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing is presented. This study bridges the gap between clinical translation and basic research in metalloimmunology, accelerating drug discovery for cancer immunotherapy and facilitating individualized precision medicine.







Abstract
Most of the anticancer compounds synthesized by chemists are primarily evaluated for their direct cytotoxic effects at the cellular level, often overlooking the critical role of the immune system. In this study, we developed a patient&#8208;derived, T&#8208;cell&#8208;retaining tumor organoid model that allows us to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of chemical drugs under the synergistic paradigm of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent killing, which may reveal the missed drug hits in the simple cytotoxic assay. We evaluated clinically approved platinum (Pt) drugs and a custom library of twenty&#8208;eight PtIV compounds. We observed low direct cytotoxicity of Pt drugs, but variable synergistic effects in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In contrast, the majority of PtIV compounds exhibited potent tumor&#8208;killing capabilities. Interestingly, several PtIV compounds went beyond direct tumor killing and showed significant immunosynergistic effects with ICIs, outstanding at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. Among these, Pt&#8208;19, PtIV compounds with cinnamate axial ligands, emerged as the most therapeutically potent, demonstrating pronounced immunosynergistic effects by promoting the release of cytotoxic cytokines, activating immune&#8208;related pathways and enhancing T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion. Overall, this initiative marks the first use of patient&#8208;derived immunocompetent tumor organoids to explore and study chemotherapy, advancing their path toward more effective small molecule drug discovery.

         <title>An ER&#8208;targeted, Viscosity&#8208;sensitive Hemicyanine Dye for the Diagnosis of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver and Photodynamic Cancer Therapy by Activating Pyroptosis Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a viscosity&#8208;sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe, ER&#8208;ZS, which can monitor ER stress&#8208;induced viscosity changes in real time. ER&#8208;ZS is also an excellent anti&#8208;hypoxia type&#8197;I photosensitizer that activates tumor cell pyroptosis by damaging the ER pathway.







Abstract
The concept of molecular design, integrating diagnostic and therapeutic functions, aligns with the general trend of modern medical advancement. Herein, we rationally designed the smart molecule ER&#8208;ZS for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted diagnosis and treatment in cell and animal models by combining hemicyanine dyes with ER&#8208;targeted functional groups (p&#8208;toluenesulfonamide). Owing to its ability to target the ER with a highly specific response to viscosity, ER&#8208;ZS demonstrated substantial fluorescence turn&#8208;on only after binding to the ER, independent of other physiological environments. In addition, ER&#8208;ZS, being a small molecule, allows for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via liver imaging based on high ER stress. Importantly, ER&#8208;ZS is a type&#8197;I photosensitizer, producing O2&#8901;&#8722; and &#8901;OH under light irradiation. Thus, after irradiating for a certain period, the photodynamic therapy inflicted severe oxidative damage to the ER of tumor cells in hypoxic (2&#8201;% O2) conditions and activated the unique pyroptosis pathway, demonstrating excellent antitumor capacity in xenograft tumor models. Hence, the proposed strategy will likely shed new light on integrating molecular optics for NAFLD diagnosis and cancer therapy.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Pyrene&#8208;Based 1,4&#8208;Dithiins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral pyrene&#8208;based 1,4&#8208;dithiins with cisoid or transoid connectivity between their cyclopenta[e]pyrene units on the dithiin core was introduced and their chiroptical properties were studied. The presence of one or two cyclopenta[e]pyrene units at the dithiin moiety was found to lead to different chiroptical parameters.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral larger fused aromatic compounds are very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations with a focus on tuning circular dichroism, with respect to the g values, depending on their connectivity.

         <title>Selective Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate towards High&#8208;valued Oxygenated Chemical Methyl p&#8208;Methyl Benzoate using a Cu/ZrO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst for upcycling PET waste into high&#8208;valued chemicals. The distinct phase structures of ZrO2, with different acid sites, play a crucial role in regulating product selectivity. Specifically, 5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2, with weak acid sites, shows high selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of MMB, while 5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2, featuring strong acid sites, predominantly produces overhydrogenated PX







Abstract
Upgrading of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste into valuable oxygenated molecules is a fascinating process, yet it remains challenging. Herein, we developed a two&#8208;step strategy involving methanolysis of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), followed by hydrogenation of DMT to produce the high&#8208;valued chemical methyl p&#8208;methyl benzoate (MMB) using a fixed&#8208;bed reactor and a Cu/ZrO2 catalyst. Interestingly, we discovered the phase structure of ZrO2 significantly regulates the selectivity of products. Cu supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2) exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 86&#8201;% for conversion of DMT to MMB, while Cu supported on tetragonal ZrO2 (5&#8201;%Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2) predominantly produces p&#8208;xylene (PX) with selectivity of 75&#8201;%. The superior selectivity of MMB over Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 can be attributed to the weaker acid sites present on m&#8208;ZrO2 compared to t&#8208;ZrO2. This weak acidity of m&#8208;ZrO2 leads to a moderate adsorption capability of MMB, and facilitating its desorption. Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal Cu/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst shows a higher effective energy barrier for cleavage of second C&#8722;O bond compared to Cu/t&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst; this distinction ensures the high selectivity of MMB. This catalyst not only presents an approach for upgrading of PET waste into fine chemicals but also offers a strategy for controlling the primary product in a multistep hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Curved Aromatics: From Donor&#8211;Acceptor Porphyrins to Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of curved metalloporphyrin tectons via a combination of coordinative and non&#8208;covalent interactions leads to unprecedented supramolecular solids with extremely large void volumes. The intricate interaction patterns found in these solids are analogous to those in some metal&#8208; and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, offering new routes toward porous molecular crystals.







Abstract
A saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;extended zinc porphyrin containing a peripheral pyridyl ligand undergoes quantitative self&#8208;assembly into a cyclic trimer. The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr&#8208;1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co&#8208;crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr&#8208;2 and UWr&#8208;3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer&#8208;Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent&#8208;filled channels, corresponding to very large probe&#8208;accessible volumes (68&#8201;% to 76&#8201;%). The UWr&#8208;2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Shuttling in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;nanometer long iridium&#8208;cornered metallorectangle was obtained and used for the encapsulation of a wide variety of planar guests. This slit&#8208;shaped metallobox is able to form host&#8211;guest complexes with a variety of planar molecules, which slide from one side of the cavity to the other, with a large amplitude motion that was experimentally quantified.







Abstract
An iridium&#8208;conjoined long and narrow metallorectangle was obtained by combining a quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine&#8208;connected Janus&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene ligand and pyrazine. The size and shape of this assembly together with the fused polyaromatic nature of its panels provides it with properties that are uncommon for other metallosupramolecular assemblies. For example, this nanosized &#8216;slit&#8208;like&#8217; metallobox is able show very large binding affinities with planar organic molecules in such a way, that the cavity is asymmetrically occupied by the guest molecule. This unsymmetrical conformation leads to the existence of a large amplitude motion of these guests, which slide between the two sides of the cavity of the host, thus constituting rare examples of molecular shuttles.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Bipolarolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B was achieved by using a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantiomerically enriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B, which possess an intriguing and complex 5/6/6/6/5 caged pentacyclic skeleton with seven contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis features a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantioenriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.

         <title>Enhanced TROSY Effect in [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C] Adenosine and ATP Analogs Facilitates NMR Spectroscopy of Very Large Biological RNAs in Solution</title>

2&#8208;19F&#8208;2&#8208;13C adenosine&#8212;large RNAs in reach of NMR. An aromatic 19F&#8208;13C isotope labelling protocol for adenosine at position 2 is introduced. The TROSY properties outcompete previous CF pyrimidine labelling Schemes and allowed dynamics, structure, and interaction characterization of 61&#8211;124&#8197;nt 20&#8211;40&#8197;kD RNAs by solution NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Large RNAs are central to cellular functions, but characterizing such RNAs remains challenging by solution NMR. We present two labeling technologies based on [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine, which allow the incorporation of aromatic 19F&#8208;13C spin pairs. The labels when coupled with the transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) enable us to probe RNAs comprising up to 124&#8197;nucleotides. With our new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;phosphoramidite, all resonances of the human hepatitis&#8197;B virus epsilon RNA could be readily assigned. With [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine triphosphate, the 124&#8197;nt pre&#8208;miR&#8208;17&#8208;NPSL1&#8208;RNA was produced via in vitro transcription and the TROSY spectrum of this 40&#8197;kDa [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A&#8208;labeled RNA featured sharper resonances than the [2&#8208;1H, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;A sample. The mutual cancelation of the chemical&#8208;shift&#8208;anisotropy and the dipole&#8208;dipole&#8208;components of TROSY&#8208;resonances leads to narrow linewidths over a wide range of molecular weights. With the synthesis of a non&#8208;hydrolysable [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine&#8208;triphosphate, we facilitate the probing of co&#8208;factor binding in kinase complexes and NMR&#8208;based inhibitor binding studies in such systems. Our labels allow a straightforward assignment for larger RNAs via a divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer/mutational approach. The new [2&#8208;19F, 2&#8208;13C]&#8208;adenosine precursors are a valuable addition to the RNA NMR toolbox and will allow the study of large RNAs/RNA protein complexes in vitro and in cells.

         <title>Toward Simultaneous Dense Zinc Deposition and Broken Side&#8208;Reaction Loops in the Zn//V2O5 System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) was developed to achieve dense zinc deposition and broken side&#8208;reaction loops in the Zn//V2O5 system simultaneously.







Abstract
The Zn//V2O5 system not only faces the incontrollable growth of zinc (Zn) dendrites, but also withstands the cross&#8208;talk effect of by&#8208;products produced from the cathode side to the Zn anode, inducing interelectrode talk and aggravating battery failure. To tackle these issues, we construct a rapid Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (R&#8208;ZSO) to achieve Zn deposition modulation and side reaction inhibition in Zn//V2O5 full cells. The polymer matrix and BN exhibit a robust anchoring effect on SO42&#8722;, accelerating Zn2+ migration and enabling dense Zn deposition behavior. Therefore, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells based on the R&#8208;ZSO electrolyte can operate stably for more than 1500&#8197;h, which is six times higher than that of cells employing the blank electrolyte. More importantly, the R&#8208;ZSO hydrogel electrolyte effectively decouples the cross&#8208;talk effects, thus breaking the infinite loop of side reactions. As a result, the Zn//V2O5 cells using this modified hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate stable operation over 1,000&#8197;cycles, with a capacity loss rate of only 0.028&#8201;% per cycle. Our study provides a promising gel chemistry, which offers a valuable guide for the construction of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reaction Kinetics using a Chemputable Framework for Data Collection and Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ChemPU platform streamlines chemistry by automating kinetic measurements, bridging synthesis and analysis. It's versatile, adaptable, and facilitates precise data encoding of reactions via the Chemical Description Language (XDL). This innovation has the potential to enhance efficiency and create a valuable database of kinetic data for broader applications.







Abstract
Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time&#8208;consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; platform with on&#8208;line analytics (UV/Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system's capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer&#8208;readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.

It's versatile, adaptable, and facilitates precise data encoding of reactions via the Chemical Description Language (XDL). This innovation has the potential to enhance efficiency and create a valuable database of kinetic data for broader applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated chemistry platforms have been widely explored, but many focus on fixed tasks for chemical synthesis or analysis. However, a typical synthetic chemistry workflow utilizes both, such as kinetic measurements for reaction development and optimization. Due to their repetitive and time-consuming nature, kinetic measurements are often omitted, which limits the mechanistic investigation of reactions. Herein, we present a &#8220;Chemputer&#8221; platform with on-line analytics (UV/Vis, NMR) which automates routine kinetic measurements. The system's capabilities are showcased by exploring an inverse electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder using initial rate measurements, a metal complexation using variable time normalization analysis (VTNA), and formation of a series of tosylamide derivatives using Hammett analysis. Over 60 individual experiments are presented which required minimal intervention, highlighting the significant time savings of automation. Owing to the modular design of the platform, which facilitates rapid integration of commercial analytical tools, our approach is widely accessible and adjustable to the reaction under investigation. The platform is operated using the chemical programming language, XDL, hence experimental procedures and results are stored in a precise, computer-readable format. We propose that widespread adoption of this reporting protocol in the chemical community could build a database of validated kinetic data beneficial for Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Bismuth&#8208;Halide Perovskite in Mesochannels of Silica Nanomembranes for Exceptional Photocatalytic Abatement of Air Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined photocatalysis promises to achieve challenging chemical transformation, but the influence of confined structure has been ignored. Here, we propose a confinement model by encapsulating Cs3Bi2Br9 into one&#8208;dimensional insulated channels of porous silica nanomembranes, rendering the concentrated electric field, high exposure of &#8901;O2&#8722; and enhanced mass transfer for exceptional photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement.







Abstract
Spatially confined photocatalysis has emerged as a viable strategy for the intensification of various redox reactions, but the influence of confined structure on reaction behavior is always overlooked in gas&#8208;solid reactions. Herein, we report a nanomembrane with confining Cs3Bi2Br9 nanocrystals inside vertical channels of porous insulated silica thin sheets (CBB@SBA(&#8869;)) for photocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) abatement. The ordered one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pore channels with mere 70&#8197;nm channel length provide a highly accessible confined space for catalytic reactions. A record&#8208;breaking NO conversion efficiency of 98.2&#8201;% under a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.0&#215;106&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, as well as exceptionally high stability over 14&#8197;h and durability over a wide humidity range (RH=15&#8211;90&#8201;%) was realized over SBA(&#8869;) confined Cs3Bi2Br9, well beyond its nonconfined analogue and the Cs3Bi2Br9 confine in Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA&#8208;15). Mechanism studies suggested that the insulated pore channels of SBA(&#8869;) in CBB@SBA(&#8869;) endow concentrated electron field and enhanced mass transfer that render high exposure of reactive species and lower reaction barrier needs for &#8901;O2&#8722; formation and NO oxidation, as well as prevents structural degradation of Cs3Bi2Br9. This work expands an innovative strategy for designing efficient photocatalysts for air pollution remediation.

         <title>Intramolecular Triplet Diffusion Facilitates Triplet Dissociation in a Pentacene Hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in covalent systems. We have developed a hexameric pentacene system, in which three pentacene dimers are covalently linked to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. This allows for an entropically driven triplet diffusion, resulting in higher yields of free triplets, and establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems.







Abstract
Triplet dynamics in singlet fission depend strongly on the strength of the electronic coupling. Covalent systems in solution offer precise control over such couplings. Nonetheless, efficient free triplet generation remains elusive in most systems, as the intermediate triplet pair 1(T1T1) is prone to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation due to its spatial confinement. In the solid state, entropically driven triplet diffusion assists in the spatial separation of triplets, resulting in higher yields of free triplets. Control over electronic coupling in the solid state is, however, challenging given its sensitivity to molecular packing. We have thus developed a hexameric system (HexPnc) to enable solid&#8208;state&#8208;like triplet diffusion at the molecular scale. This system is realized by covalently tethering three pentacene dimers to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. Transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical structural optimizations and steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, reveals that triplet diffusion is indeed facilitated due to intramolecular cluster formation. The yield of free triplets in HexPnc is increased by a factor of up to 14 compared to the corresponding dimeric reference (DiPnc). Thus, HexPnc establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems by providing avenues for diffusive separation of 1(T1T1), while, concomitantly, retaining strong interchromophore coupling which preserves rapid formation of 1(T1T1).
