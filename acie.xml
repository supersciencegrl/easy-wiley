         <title>Dicyanocarbene&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Efficient Quinoidization for the Development of Fused N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicyanomethylene&#8208;terminated quinoidal materials are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring excellent electron mobilities and air stability. Traditional synthetic methods of these materials such as Takahashi reaction, require the use of expensive palladium catalyst and halogenated substrates. However, for electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, the poor stability after halogenation renders their halogenated derivatives unsuitable as reaction precursors. To address this issue, we present a new metal&#8208;free synthetic approach using 2&#8208;(dimethylsulfaneylidene)malononitrile as the quinoidization reagent, which is successfully applied to various electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, leading to the corresponding quinoidal compounds with high yields up to 94%. We proposed the reaction mechanism, and investigated the physical properties of four fused quinoidal materials based on highly electron&#8208;rich fused aromatic compounds, which are scarce to be synthesized by the traditional method. Furthermore, these fused quinoidal materials were utilized in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving high electron mobilities up to 1.33 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. We provide an effective synthetic approach to expand the library of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface, especially in the absence of dynamic protection mechanism between them. To overcome this limitation, benefitting from their synergistic physical and chemical properties, chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) are employed as superior colloid electrolyte to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs. This unique strategy not only enables continuous optimization of the electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry within the battery but also facilitates self&#8208;repairing of mechanical damage both internally and externally, thereby achieving comprehensive, persistent, and dynamic protection. As a result, the modified Zinc (Zn) symmetric cells present high Zn plating/stripping coulombic efficiencies of 97.71% ~ 99.81% from 5 to 100 mA cm&#8208;2, and remarkably service lifespan up to 8,200 h (more than 11 months). Additionally, the Zn//MnO2 full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 70.1% after 3,000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1. This dynamic protective strategy to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry may open up a new avenue for building better AZBs and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Deep Learning Search for Exceptional Chiroptical Properties? The Halogenated [6]Helicene Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have focused on one of the most important chiral motifs, [6]helicene, and we have predicted the effect of halogenation on its chiroptical properties using Deep Learning. We have developed three machine learning models, which allow us to evaluate millions of compounds and learn the reasons that favor some substitutions. With the knowledge gained, we synthesized the most favored candidates, exhibiting the predicted properties.







Abstract
The relationship between chemical structure and chiroptical properties is not always clearly understood. Nowadays, efforts to develop new systems with enhanced optical properties follow the trial&#8208;error method. A large number of data would allow us to obtain more robust conclusions and guide research toward molecules with practical applications. In this sense, in this work we predict the chiroptical properties of millions of halogenated [6]helicenes in terms of the rotatory strength (R). We have used DFT calculations to randomly create derivatives including from 1 to 16 halogen atoms, that were then used as a data set to train different deep neural network models. These models allow us to i) predict the Rmax for any halogenated [6]helicene with a very low computational cost, and ii) to understand the physical reasons that favour some substitutions over others. Finally, we synthesized derivatives with higher predicted Rmax obtaining excellent correlation among the values obtained experimentally and the predicted ones.

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reaction strategy is applied to regulate compressive strain at CsPbI3 surface. The synergistic effect of chemical bonding and strain regulation suppresses interface recombination and phase transition, leading to enhanced PCE of 21.0&#8201;% and promising operational stability with T99 over 2000&#8197;h at MPP tracking which represents one of the most stable wide band gap PSCs.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0&#8201;% and 18.6&#8201;% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% R.&#8197;H. air) for 2000&#8197;h, and remain 99&#8201;% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000&#8197;h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Indole N&#8208;Linked Hydroperoxyl Adduct of Protein&#8208;Derived Cofactor Modulating Catalase&#8208;Peroxidase Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) neutralizes hydrogen peroxide during infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG from cells grown at ambient temperature contains an indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct, MYW&#8208;OOH (golden color). MYW&#8208;OOH transiently inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique off switch. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature converts MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW (blue color) and restores KatG's detoxifying ability.







Abstract
Bifunctional catalase&#8208;peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW&#8208;OOH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW&#8208;OOH&#8208;containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW&#8208;OOH. We discovered that MYW&#8208;OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW&#8208;OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW&#8208;OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of N&#8208;linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bifunctional catalase-peroxidase (KatG) features a posttranslational methionine-tyrosine-tryptophan (MYW) crosslinked cofactor crucial for its catalase function, enabling pathogens to neutralize hydrogen peroxide during infection. We discovered the presence of indole nitrogen-linked hydroperoxyl adduct (MYW-OOH) in &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; KatG in the solution state under ambient conditions, suggesting its natural occurrence. By isolating predominantly MYW-OOH-containing KatG protein, we investigated the chemical stability and functional impact of MYW-OOH. We discovered that MYW-OOH inhibits catalase activity, presenting a unique temporary lock. Exposure to peroxide or increased temperature removes the hydroperoxyl adduct from the protein cofactor, converting MYW-OOH to MYW and restoring the detoxifying ability of the enzyme against hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked hydroperoxyl group is releasable. KatG with MYW-OOH represents a catalase dormant, but primed, state of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into chemical strategies targeting the bifunctional enzyme KatG in pathogens, highlighting the role of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked hydroperoxyl modifications in enzymatic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Loading Dyes into Chiral Cd/Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sizes of chiral MOFs can be controlled from sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m to over 7&#8197;mm by tuning the types and additional amounts of organic dyes. The full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence MOFs are synthesized by different dyes encapsulation, which are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest chemistry of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has endowed them with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), it is still limited for MOFs to systematically tune full&#8208;color CPL emissions and sizes. This work directionally assembles the chiral ligands, metal sites and organic dyes to prepare a series of crystalline enantiomeric D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n MOFs (n=1~5, representing the adding amount of dyes), where D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn with the formula of Cd2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) and Zn2(D/L&#8211;Cam)2(TPyPE) (D/L&#8208;Cam=D/L&#8208;camphoric acid, TPyPE=4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;henediidenetetra&#8208;4,1&#8208;phenylene)tetrakis[pyridine]) were used as the chiral platforms. The framework&#8208;dye&#8208;enabled emission and through&#8208;space chirality transfer facilitate D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n bright full&#8208;color CPL activity. The ideal yellow CPL of D&#8208;Cd&#8208;5 and D&#8208;Zn&#8208;4, with |glum| as 4.9&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;3 and 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and relatively high photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.79&#8201;% and 45.40&#8201;%, are further assembled into a white CPL light&#8208;emitting diode. The crystal sizes of D/L&#8208;Cd/Zn&#8208;n were found to be strongly correlated to the types and additional amounts of organic dyes, that the positive organic dyes allow for the preparation of &gt;&#8201;7&#8197;mm bulks and negative dyes account for sub&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;m particles. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate full&#8208;color emissive CPL composites and provides a potentially universal method for controlling the size of optical platforms.

         <title>DNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Single&#8208;Molecule Cargo Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA origami&#8208;based biosensor for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery using single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET). The hydrophobic ATTO647N&#8208;modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash on the sensor detects vesicle binding via FRET changes and delivers molecular cargo through triggered strand displacement reaction. This platform offers innovative applications in biosensing and controllable stoichiometric loading of vesicles.







Abstract
Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Utilizing DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor with single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a DNA origami nanostructure. In a vesicle&#8208;free environment, the ssDNA coils, ensuring high FRET efficiency. Upon vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, reducing FRET efficiency. As the next step, the sensing strand serves as molecular cargo that can be transferred to the vesicle through a triggered strand displacement reaction. Depending on the number of cholesterols on the displacer strands, we either induce a diffusive release of the fluorescent load towards neighboring vesicles or a stoichiometric release of a single cargo&#8208;unit to the vesicle on the nanosensor. Ultimately, our multi&#8208;functional liposome interaction and detection platform opens up pathways for innovative biosensing applications and stoichiometric loading of vesicles with single&#8208;molecule control.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Nucleophile Coupling: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deborylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general deborylative cyanation protocol representative of an enantioconvergent cross&#8208;nucleophile coupling platform. Mechanistic study suggests the formation of prochiral alkyl radicals via aniline&#8208;assisted single&#8208;electron activation of organoboron species. Electronic structure analysis of the reactive CuII(CN)2 complex indicates a significant amount of ligand&#8208;based radical density.







Abstract
Organoboron compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis for their diverse reactivity, modular preparation, and stability compared to other classes of organometallic reagents. While organoboron species are commonly employed as nucleophiles in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, their potential as racemic building blocks in enantioconvergent transformations remains largely untapped. Herein, we demonstrate the direct utilization of alkylboronic pinacol esters in intermolecular enantioconvergent transformations. Specifically, this work describes the development and mechanistic study of an enantioconvergent deborylative cyanation enabled by Cu catalysis. This method imparts a high degree of enantioselectivity and tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a radical&#8208;relay mechanism. Aniline&#8208;assisted homolysis of the carbon&#8211;boron bond results in prochiral alkyl radicals that are functionalized by in situ generated Cu(II)(CN)2 species in an enantioselective fashion. The Cu(II)(CN)2 intermediate was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and its electronic structure was probed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Computational studies were carried out to corroborate the proposed radical&#8208;relay mechanism.

         <title>Chemical Recording of Pump&#8208;Specific Drug Efflux in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, the drug of interest competes with the efflux of BEP through specific pumps, resulting in the accumulation of BEP within the cells. The elevated intracellular levels of BEP induced by the drug contribute to a heightened extent of protein labeling. We developed two BEPs based on per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharide labeling and photocatalytic proximity labeling to record drug efflux by multidrug resistance proteins and p&#8208;glycoprotein, respectively.







Abstract
Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump&#8208;specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac4GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure&#8208;efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high&#8208;throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light&#8208;activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.

&lt;p&gt;Drug efflux&#8212;a process primarily facilitated by efflux pumps such as multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)&#8212;plays a pivotal role in cellular resistance to chemotherapies. Conventional approaches to assess drug efflux are predominantly conducted in vitro and often lack pump specificity. Here we report the bioorthogonal reporter inhibiting efflux (BRIEF) strategy, which enables the recording of pump-specific drug efflux in living cells. In BRIEF, a specific substrate is engineered as a bioorthogonal efflux probe (BEP) for specific pumps. The cellular concentration and protein labeling level of the probe can be augmented when the test drug is transported by the same pumps. Serendipitously, we discovered that per-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated unnatural monosaccharides, initially designed for metabolic glycan labeling, are exported by some MRPs. Using Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;GlcNAl as a BEP, we studied the structure-efflux relationship of flavonoids and identified small molecules, including tannic acid, cholesterol and gallic acid, as novel MRP substrates in high-throughput screening. Tannic acid, known for anti-tumor and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, showed increased efficacy upon MRP inhibition. Additionally, BRIEF was adapted to assess p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux using Rhodamine&#8197;123 as a BEP, leveraging its light-activatable proximity labeling ability. BRIEF provides a versatile approach to investigate drug efflux and enhance chemotherapy strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micro&#8208;Mesopore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing zeolite micro&#8208;mesopore diffusion optimization, this study engineers a bifunctional catalytic system that achieves 94.0&#8201;% conversion of plastic waste into liquid alkanes, with 84.8&#8201;% in the C5&#8722;C7 range, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity for upcycling of polymers into high&#8208;value fuels.







Abstract
Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion has emerged as a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a wide carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we present a bifunctional catalytic system consisting of &#946; zeolite mixed hierarchical Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, designed for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a 94.0&#8201;% yield of liquid alkane, with 84.8&#8201;% of C5&#8722;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, by optimizing the micro&#8208;mesopores of Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, the scaling relationship between the pore structure and the conversion/selectivity is identified. The rapid diffusion of olefins within these micro&#8208;mesopores significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.

         <title>Diaminonaphthalene Boronic Acid (DANBA): New Approach for Peroxynitrite Sensing Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA) proved to be a universal and highly selective recognition group for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species, overcoming the long&#8208;standing issues of aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based probes. DANBA can be combined with diverse hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores to obtain ONOO&#8722; sensing probes with different spectral emissions. A DANBA and malononitrile fluorophore&#8208;based probe detected subtle changes in the ONOO&#8722; levels of mouse brains with Parkinson's disease.







Abstract
Selective detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is vital for studying their role in brain diseases. Fluorescence probes can distinguish ONOO&#8722; species from other ROS; however, their selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; species depends on the ONOO&#8722; recognition group. Aryl&#8208;boronic acids and esters, which are common ONOO&#8722; recognition groups, are not selective for ONOO&#8722; over H2O2. In this study, we developed a diaminonaphthalene (DAN)&#8208;protected boronic acid as a new ONOO&#8722; recognition group that selectively reacts with ONOO&#8722; over H2O2 and other ROS. Three DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid (DANBA)&#8208;based fluorophores that emit fluorescence over visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, Cou&#8208;BN, BVP&#8208;BN, and HDM&#8208;BN, and their aryl&#8208;boronic acid&#8208;based counterparts (Cou&#8208;BO, BVP&#8208;BO, and HDM&#8208;BO), were developed. The DANBA&#8208;based probes exhibited enhanced selectivity toward ONOO&#8722; over that of their control group, as well as universality in solution assays and in vitro experiments with PC12 cells. The NIR&#8208;emissive HDM&#8208;BN was optimized to delineate in vivo ONOO&#8722; levels in mouse brains with Parkinson's disease. This DAN&#8208;protected boronic acid belongs to a new generation of recognition groups for developing ONOO&#8722; probes, and this strategy could be extended to other common hydroxyl&#8208;containing dyes to detect ONOO&#8722; levels in complex biological systems and processes.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Polymer Membranes with Intrinsic Microporosity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) containing hydrophilic Tr&#246;ger's base groups were coated as ultrathin selective membranes on zinc metal anodes to regulate the ion transport and electrochemical reactions at interfaces. The PIM membranes regulate the zinc ion transport and effectively mitigate zinc dendrite growth, as well as reduce corrosive side reactions, leading to safe and stable zinc metal batteries.







Abstract
Metallic zinc has emerged as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy battery systems due to its high theoretical capacity (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), low redox potential for two&#8208;electron reactions, cost&#8208;effectiveness and inherent safety. However, current zinc metal batteries face challenges in low coulombic efficiency and limited longevity due to uncontrollable dendrite growth, the corrosive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decomposition of the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. Here, we report an interfacial&#8208;engineering approach to mitigate dendrite growth and reduce corrosive reactions through the design of ultrathin selective membranes coated on the zinc anodes. The submicron&#8208;thick membranes derived from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), featuring pores with tunable interconnectivity, facilitate regulated transport of Zn2+&#8208;ions, thereby promoting a uniform plating/stripping process. Benefiting from the protection by PIM membranes, zinc symmetric cells deliver a stable cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA/cm2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh while full cells with NaMnO2 cathode operate stably at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 300&#8197;cycles without capacity decay. Our work represents a new strategy of preparing multi&#8208;functional membranes that can advance the development of safe and stable zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organized Patterns in Non&#8208;Reciprocal Active Droplet Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary mixtures of droplets exhibiting non&#8208;reciprocal active interactions self&#8208;organize into dynamic patterns upon tuning the number ratio and size ratio of the two populations and the surfactant composition. A minimal mathematical model recapitulates the experimentally observed patterns. The chemical organizing principles governing the binary droplet system are extendable to multicomponent active droplet mixtures.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self&#8208;organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplet mixtures with predator&#8208;prey interactions can result in a variety of self&#8208;organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self&#8208;organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.

&lt;p&gt;Non-equilibrium patterns are widespread in nature and often arise from the self-organization of constituents through nonreciprocal chemotactic interactions. In this study, we demonstrate how active oil-in-water droplet mixtures with predator-prey interactions can result in a variety of self-organized patterns. By manipulating physical parameters, the droplet diameter ratio and number ratio, we identify distinct classes of patterns within a binary droplet system, rationalize the pattern formation, and quantify motilities. Experimental results are recapitulated in numerical simulations using a minimal computational model that solely incorporates chemotactic interactions and steric repulsion among the constituents. The time evolution of the patterns is investigated and chemically explained. We also investigate how patterns vary with differing interaction strength by altering surfactant composition. Leveraging insights from the binary droplet system, the framework is extended to a ternary droplet mixture composed of multiple chasing droplet pairs to create chemically directed hierarchical organization. Our findings demonstrate how rationalizable, self-organized patterns can be programmed in a chemically minimal system and provide the basis for exploration of emergent organization and higher order complexity in active colloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient modelling of the economically impactful enzyme, TxtE, has been probed, in which indole (tryptophan mimic) nitration was observed by a putative heme&#8208;peroxynitrite intermediate, resembling one of the prime enzymatic mechanistic proposals. Experimental and theoretical exploration of the mechanism reveal a unique reaction landscape dictated by NO2 radical species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide (NO) and dioxygen (O2) as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8722;&#8901;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Accessing Therapeutically&#8208;Relevant Multifunctional Antisense Oligonucleotide Conjugates Using Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide and carbohydrate&#8208;antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) conjugates containing clinically&#8208;relevant phosphorothioate (PS) and locked&#8208;nucleic acid (LNA) backbone modifications are efficiently prepared using native chemical ligation. Chemoselective post&#8208;ligation modification of ASO conjugates is accomplished using radical desulfurization and cysteine modification chemistry to deliver valuable multifunctional constructs.







Abstract
Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies hold significant promise in the realm of molecular medicine. By precisely targeting RNA molecules, ASOs offer an approach to modulate gene expression and protein production, making them valuable tools for treating a wide range of genetic and acquired diseases. As the precise intracellular targeting and delivery of ASOs is challenging, strategies for preparing ASO&#8208;ligand conjugates are in exceedingly high demand. This work leverages the utility of native chemical ligation to conjugate ASOs with therapeutically relevant chemical modifications including locked nucleic acids and phosphorothioate backbone modifications to peptides and sugars via a stable amide linkage. A suite of post&#8208;ligation functionalizations through modification of the cysteine ligation handle are highlighted, including chemoselective radical desulfurization, lipidation, and alkylation with a range of valuable handles (e.g. alkyne, biotin, and radionuclide chelating ligands), affording multifunctional constructs for further applications in biology and medicine. Application of the methodology to a clinically&#8208;relevant triantennary&#8208;GalNAc ASO conjugate and validation of its binding and functional activity underpins the applicability of the technique to oligonucleotide&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization with Conductive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive polymers such as polyaniline are promising polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization. They are tunable, can be functionalized, and their unpaired electrons can be hyperpolarized by chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity. We show solid&#8208;state dynamic nuclear polarization of polyaniline at liquid helium temperatures with an intriguing mechanism crossover as radical concentration is increased.







Abstract
The low sensitivity of liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be overcome by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP). It consists of transferring the near&#8208;unity polarization of unpaired electron spins of stable radicals to the nuclear spins of interest at liquid helium temperatures, below 2&#8197;K, before melting the sample in view of hyperpolarized liquid&#8208;state magnetic resonance experiments. Reaching such a temperature is challenging and requires complex instrumentation, which impedes the deployment of dDNP. Here, we propose organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) as a new class of polarizing matrices and report 1H polarizations of up to 5&#8201;%. We also show that 13C spins of a host solution impregnated in porous conductive polymers can be hyperpolarized by relayed DNP. Such conductive polymers can be synthesized as chiral and display current induced spin selectivity leading to electron spin hyperpolarization close to unity without the need for low temperatures nor high magnetic fields. Our results show the feasibility of solid&#8208;state DNP in conductive polymers that are known to exhibit chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Gallium Intermetallic Compounds with Tailored Active Site Configurations for Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The obtained CoGa intermetallic compounds with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure and isolated electron&#8208;rich Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) process, thus significantly improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Gallium (Ga) with a low melting point can serve as a unique metallic solvent in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The negative formation enthalpy of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs endows them with high catalytic stability. Meanwhile, their tunable crystal structures offer the possibility to tailor the configurations of active sites to meet the requirements for specific catalytic applications. Herein, we present a general method for preparing a range of transition metal&#8208;Ga IMCs, including Co&#8722;Ga, Ni&#8722;Ga, Pt&#8722;Ga, Pd&#8722;Ga, and Rh&#8722;Ga IMCs. The structurally ordered CoGa IMCs with body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) structure are uniformly dispersed on the nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide substrate (O&#8208;CoGa/NG) and deliver outstanding nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) performance, making them excellent catalysts to construct highly efficient rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Operando studies and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;rich environments around the Co atoms enhance the adsorption strength of *NO3 intermediate and simultaneously suppress the formation of hydrogen, thus improving the NO3RR activity and selectivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Absorbance&#8208;Activated Droplet Sorting for Engineering Aldehyde Dehydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorting platform was developed for library screening. Absorbance in picoliter droplets is measured using a lithographic mask, with sorted droplets identified by impedance detection. This method allows sensitive detection and sorting at kHz rates. The efficiency of the platform is demonstrated by screening a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library, yielding a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the commercial use of biocatalysts, transitioning from energy&#8208;intensive traditional chemistries to more sustainable methods. Current enzyme engineering techniques, such as directed evolution, require the generation and testing of large mutant libraries to identify optimized variants. Unfortunately, conventional screening methods are unable to screen such large libraries in a robust and timely manner. Droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems have emerged as a powerful high&#8208;throughput tool for library screening at kilohertz rates. Unfortunately, almost all reported systems are based on fluorescence detection, restricting their use to a limited number of enzyme types that naturally convert fluorogenic substrates or require the use of surrogate substrates. To expand the range of enzymes amenable to evolution using droplet&#8208;based microfluidic systems, we present an absorbance&#8208;activated droplet sorter that allows droplet sorting at kilohertz rates without the need for optical monitoring of the microfluidic system. To demonstrate the utility of the sorter, we rapidly screen a 105&#8208;member aldehyde dehydrogenase library towards D&#8208;glyceraldehyde using a NADH mediated coupled assay that generates WST&#8208;1 formazan as the colorimetric product. We successfully identify a variant with a 51&#8201;% improvement in catalytic efficiency and a significant increase in overall activity across a broad substrate spectrum.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for the direct reuse of spent LiFePO4 electrodes is developed by simply soaking the spent electrodes in a lithiation reagent solution at room temperature for 6&#8197;min. Being reused directly, the regenerated LiFePO4 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed in air for 3&#8197;months.







Abstract
The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1&#8197;M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6&#8197;minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being exposed to air for 3&#8197;months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.

         <title>Potent and Protease Resistant Azapeptide Agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 and GIP Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azapeptides are highly structured and protease resistant peptidomimetics that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids. A single atom change in 3.5&#8197;kDa peptides from C&#945; to N&#945; was used to generate equipotent GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR mono agonists, and a unimolecular dual agonist. All azapeptide analogues were fully refractory to the front&#8208;line protease, DPP4, that degrades GLP&#8208;1 and GIP within minutes.







Abstract
The gut&#8208;derived peptide hormones glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 (GLP&#8208;1) and glucose&#8208;dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play important physiological roles including glucose homeostasis and appetite suppression. Stabilized agonists of the GLP&#8208;1 receptor (GLP&#8208;1R) and dual agonists of GLP&#8208;1R and GIP receptor (GIPR) for the management of type&#8197;2 diabetes and obesity have generated widespread enthusiasm and have become blockbuster drugs. These therapeutics are refractory to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase&#8208;4 (DPP4), that catalyzes rapid removal of the two N&#8208;terminal residues of the native peptides, in turn severely diminishing their activity profiles. Here we report that a single atom change from carbon to nitrogen in the backbone of the entire peptide makes them refractory to DPP4 action while still retaining full potency and efficacy at their respective receptors. This was accomplished by use of aza&#8208;amino acids, that are bioisosteric replacements for &#945;&#8208;amino acids that perturb the structural backbone and local side chain conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that aza&#8208;amino acid can populate the same conformational space that GLP&#8208;1 adopts when bound to the GLP&#8208;1R. The insertion of an aza&#8208;amino acid at the second position from the N&#8208;terminus in semaglutide and in a dual agonist of GLP&#8208;1R and GIPR further demonstrates its capability as a viable alternative to current DPP4 resistance strategies while offering additional structural variation that may influence downstream signaling.

         <title>Triphasic Hydroxysilylation of Alkenes by Mechanically Piezoelectric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical strategy for the 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of both activated and unactivated alkenes using silylboronate and oxygen gas, facilitated by piezoelectric materials (Li2TiO3) serving as a redox catalyst in a triphasic catalytic system is introduced. This approach offers multiple advantages, including a brief reaction time of 30 minutes, solvent&#8208;free conditions, catalyst recyclability, and the avoidance of the need for strong base activation of silylboronate or external reductants.







Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes is crucial for synthesizing organosilicon compounds which are key intermediates in material science, pharmaceuticals, and organic synthesis. The development of strategies employing hydrogen atom transfer pathways is currently hindered by the existence of various competing reactions. Herein, we reported a novel mechanochemical strategy for the triphasic 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of alkenes through a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer pathway. Our approach not only circumvents competitive reactions to enable the first&#8208;ever 1,2&#8208;hydroxysilylation of unactivated alkenes but also pioneers the research in mechanic force&#8208;induced triphasic reactions under ambient conditions. This gentle method offers excellent compatibility with various functional groups, operates under simple and solvent&#8208;free conditions, ensures rapid reaction time. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that silylboronate can be transformed to a silicon radical by highly polarized Li2TiO3 particles and oxygen under ball&#8208;milling condition.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, thiourea isomer derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB) were developed. It is found that AT can effectively regulate crystallization process and passivate defects of perovskite by binding with undercoordinated Pb2+ through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.80&#8197;eV. The AT&#8208;treated device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% and excellent stability.







Abstract
Various isomers have been developed to regulate the morphology and reduce defects in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To insight the structure&#8208;function&#8208;effect correlations for the isomerization of thiourea derivatives on the performance of the PSCs, we developed two thiourea derivatives [(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB). Supported by experimental and calculated results, it was found that AT can bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ defect through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.818&#8197;eV, which is much higher than that from the synergistic interaction between two &#8722;NH&#8722; groups in HB and perovskite (1.015&#8197;eV). Moreover, the stronger interaction between AT and Pb2+ regulates the crystallization process of perovskite film to obtain a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with high crystallinity, large grain size, and low defect density. Consequently, the AT&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% (certified as 24.66&#8201;%), which is greatly higher than control (23.74&#8201;%) and HB&#8208;treated FACsPbI3 devices (25.05&#8201;%). The resultant device exhibits a remarkable stability for maintaining 91.0&#8201;% and 95.2&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging 2000&#8197;h in air condition or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Here, thiourea isomer derivatives [(3,5-dichlorophenyl)amino]thiourea (AT) and N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide (HB) were developed. It is found that AT can effectively regulate crystallization process and passivate defects of perovskite by binding with undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; through synergistic interaction between N1 and C=S group with a defect formation energy of 1.80&#8197;eV. The AT-treated device engenders an efficiency of 25.71&#8201;% and excellent stability.

         <title>Hydrogen Sulfide&#8208;Triggered Artificial DNAzyme Switches for Precise Manipulation of Cellular Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas signaling molecule&#8208;responsive artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based switches (GRAS) have been developed as H2S&#8208;driven nanodevices for manipulating cellular functions. GRAS is highly programmable and versatile, enabling the customization of user&#8208;defined H2S signaling inputs to down&#8208;regulate mRNA expression and activate RTK signaling pathways at various subcellular levels, thereby allowing for precise regulation of cell behavior.







Abstract
The development of synthetic molecular tools responsive to biological cues is crucial for advancing targeted cellular regulation. A significant challenge is the regulation of cellular processes in response to gaseous signaling molecules such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this, we present the design of Gas signaling molecule&#8208;Responsive Artificial DNAzyme&#8208;based Switches (GRAS) to manipulate cellular functions via H2S&#8208;sensitive synthetic DNAzymes. By incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to the phosphorothioate backbone, DNAzymes are strategically designed with H2S&#8208;responsive azide groups at cofactor binding locations within the catalytic core region. These modifications enable their activation through H2S&#8208;reducing decaging, thereby initiating substrate cleavage activity. Our approach allows for the flexible customization of various DNAzymes to regulate distinct cellular processes in diverse scenarios. Intracellularly, the enzymatic activity of GRAS promotes H2S&#8208;induced cleavage of specific mRNA sequences, enabling targeted gene silencing and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, integrating GRAS with dynamic DNA assembly allows for grafting these functional switches onto cell surface receptors, facilitating H2S&#8208;triggered receptor dimerization. This extracellular activation transmits signals intracellularly to regulate cellular behaviors such as migration and proliferation. Collectively, synthetic switches are capable of rewiring cellular functions in response to gaseous cues, offering a promising avenue for advanced targeted cellular engineering.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Catalytic Cascade for the Depolymerization of the Lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Motif to Non&#8208;phenolic Dealkylated Aromatics</title>

An atom&#8208;efficient domino strategy maximizing the yield of non&#8208;phenolic dealkylated aromatics from the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif by one&#8208;pot catalytic cascade, consisting of selective dehydrogenation of &#947;&#8208;carbinol group, retro&#8208;aldol to cleave C&#8722;C bonds, and decarbonylation of the generated aldehydes.







Abstract
Aromatic monomers obtained by selective depolymerization of the lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 motif are typically phenolic and contain (oxygenated) alkyl substitutions. This work reveals the potential of a one&#8208;pot catalytic lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 depolymerization cascade strategy that yields a uniform set of methoxylated aromatics without alkyl side&#8208;chains. This cascade consists of the selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy group, a subsequent retro&#8208;aldol reaction that cleaves the C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bond, followed by in situ acceptorless decarbonylation of the formed aldehydes. This three&#8208;step cascade reaction, catalyzed by an iridium(I)&#8208;BINAP complex, resulted in 75&#8201;% selectivity for 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene from G&#8208;type lignin dimers, alongside syngas (CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2&#8776;1.4&#8201;:&#8201;1). Applying this method to a synthetic G&#8208;type polymer, 11&#8197;wt&#8201;% 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene was obtained. This versatile compound can be easily transformed into 3,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenol, a valuable precursor for pharmaceutical synthesis, through an enzymatic catalytic approach. Moreover, the hydrodeoxygenation potential of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxybenzene offers a pathway to produce valuable cyclohexane or benzene derivatives, presenting enticing opportunities for sustainable chemical transformations without the necessity for phenolic mixture upgrading via dealkylation.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 systems, synthesized via an innovative template&#8208;assisted approach, display high conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Gas sensors utilizing these systems demonstrate significant sensitivity to ultratrace H2S at room temperature and outstanding selectivity. Additionally, wearable sensors integrating these systems can capture human motion signals, opening up new possibilities for such devices.







Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri (p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD~6&#8197;ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.

         <title>An Integrated Module Performs Selective &#8216;Online&#8217; Epoxidation in the Biosynthesis of the Antibiotic Mupirocin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important and biosynthetically challenging polyketide antibiotic that requires key assembly steps including epoxidation, tetrahydropyran ring formation and fatty acid esterification. A linear polyketide fragment of mupirocin with six asymmetric centres was synthesized, and it was demonstrated that the mini&#8208;module MmpE is docked to MmpA and performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation using a previously unannotated ACP.







Abstract
The delineation of the complex biosynthesis of the potent antibiotic mupirocin, which consists of a mixture of pseudomonic acids (PAs) isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586, presents significant challenges, and the timing and mechanisms of several key transformations remain elusive. Particularly intriguing are the steps that process the linear backbone from the initial polyketide assembly phase to generate the first cyclic intermediate PA&#8208;B. These include epoxidation as well as incorporation of the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and fatty acid side chain required for biological activity. Herein, we show that the mini&#8208;module MmpE performs a rare online (ACP&#8208;substrate) epoxidation and is integrated (&#8216;in&#8208;cis&#8217;) into the polyketide synthase via a docking domain. A linear polyketide fragment with six asymmetric centres was synthesised using a convergent approach and used to demonstrate substrate flux via an atypical KS0 and a previously unannotated ACP (MmpE_ACP). MmpE_ACP&#8208;bound synthetic substrates were critical in demonstrating successful epoxidation in vitro by the purified MmpE oxidoreductase domain. Alongside feeding studies, these results confirm the timing as well as chain length dependence of this selective epoxidation. These mechanistic studies pinpoint the location and nature of the polyketide substrate prior to the key formation of the THP ring and esterification that generate PA&#8208;B.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Supra&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Dots with Long Lifetime Photogenerated Radicals Boosting Tumor Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor type supra&#8208;CDs has been fabricated by using red emissive CDs as donor and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule as acceptor. This peculiar donor&#8208;acceptor configuration facilitates the efficient charge separation in supra&#8208;CDs, thereby generating more superoxide radicals and additional holes&#8208;related radicals, which collectively boosts type&#8208;I tumor photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have gained significant interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Nevertheless, developing CDs with efficient photoinduced charge separation for tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. This study presents a novel class of supra&#8208;carbon&#8208;dots (supra&#8208;CDs) developed by fusing red emissive CDs with 2,3&#8208;dicyanohydroquinone (DCHQ) via post&#8208;solvothermal treatment. In supra&#8208;CDs, the core, acting as electron donors, is formed by assembled CDs with substantial sp2 domains, the fused interface originating from DCHQ with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups functions as the electron acceptor. This configuration creates the unique donor&#8208;acceptor nanostructure. Upon white light irradiation, the excited electrons from the assembled CDs were transferred to the electron&#8208;withdrawing interface, whereas the photogenerated holes were retained within the assembled CDs as radicals, leading to effective photoinduced charge separation. The separated photogenerated electrons then react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes undergo oxidation of crucial cellular substrates. This dual action underscores the exceptional cell&#8208;killing efficacy of supra&#8208;CDs. Moreover, the increased particle sizes (~20&#8197;nm) ensure supra&#8208;CDs to exhibit a notable capacity for tumor accumulation via the improved permeability and retention effect, thereby achieving satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor PDT efficacy in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Switchable Lattice Oxygen Sites for Selective C&#8722;H and C(O)&#8722;C Bond Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;switching strategy for in situ formulating stationary or removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in ESE&#8208;NiOOH is developed with ultrahigh selectivity for electrocatalytic upgrading of aromatic secondary alcohols via direct dehydrogenation to acetophenones or C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage to benzoic acids. Precisely modulating lattice&#8208;oxygen removability is reported for the first time to activate C&#8722;H and vector downstream reactions.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen is highly oxidizable, ideal for electrocatalytic C&#8722;H oxidation but insufficient alone for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage due to the non&#8208;removable nature of lattice sites. Here, we present a visible light&#8208;assisted electrochemical method of in situ formulating removable lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in a nickel&#8208;oxyhydroxide (ESE&#8208;NiOOH) electrocatalyst. This catalyst efficiently converts aromatic alcohols and carbonyls with C(O)&#8722;C fragments from lignin and plastics into benzoic acids (BAs) with high yields (83&#8211;99&#8201;%). Without light irradiation, ESE&#8208;NiOOH's intrinsic lattice&#8208;oxygen is non&#8208;removable and inert for C(O)&#8722;C bond cleavage. In situ characterizations show light&#8208;induced lattice&#8208;oxygen removal and regeneration via OH&#8722; refilling. Theoretical calculations identify the nucleophilic oxygen attack on ketone&#8208;derived carbanion as a rate&#8208;determining step, which can be remarkably facilitated by removable lattice&#8208;oxygen to activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an &#8220;electrochemical funnel&#8221; strategy is developed for high&#8208;efficiency upgrading aromatic mixtures with C(O)&#8722;C moieties into BA with up to 94&#8201;% yield. This in situ removal&#8208;regeneration approach for lattice sites opens an avenue for the tailored design of interfacial electrocatalysts to selectively upcycle waste carbon sources into valuable products.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate was developed to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment through PD&#8722;L1 down&#8208;regulation and hypoxia reversion, leading to highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small&#8208;molecular Pt(II) complex. The study led to the proposal of an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time.







Abstract
With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8722;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8722;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8722;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8722;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8722;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8722;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8722;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.

The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products was significantly enhanced over Cu by the modification of n&#8208;butylamine at acidic media. The FE of C2+ products could reach up to 81.8&#8201;% with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the FE of C2+ alcohols was 52.6&#8201;%. The amine molecule on the surface of Cu could not only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which resulted in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products (e.g. C2+ alcohols) offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. Use of strong alkaline electrolytes is favorable to producing C2+ products. However, CO2 can react with hydroxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate, which results in low carbon utilization efficiency and poor stability. Using acidic electrolyte is an efficient way to solve the problems, but it is a challenge to achieve high selectivity of C2+ products. Here we report that the amine modified copper nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity of C2+ products and carbon utilization at acidic condition. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reach up to 81.8&#8201;% at acidic media (pH=2) with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over n&#8208;butylamine modified Cu. Especially the FE of C2+ alcohols is 52.6&#8201;%, which is higher than those reported for CO2 electroreduction at acidic condition. In addition, the single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency towards C2+ production reach up to 60&#8201;%. Detailed studies demonstrate that the amine molecule on the surface of Cu cannot only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which result in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids for Nucleolin&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise supramolecular nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) were designed by incorporating a pair of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified with multiple nucleic acids and adamantane with functional targeting nucleic acid. These Supra&#8208;SNAs with multivalent structure exhibit enhanced nuclease resistance, cellular uptake, and gene regulation capabilities in comparison to single&#8208;stranded DNA molecule. Moreover, the inhibition of gene expression in tumor cells leads to down&#8208;regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thus effective cell proliferation and death against tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular spherical nucleic acids (m&#8208;SNAs) are a second generation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which are of significance in potential application of targeted delivery of nucleic acids or gene regulation due to their defined molecular structures. Nevertheless, m&#8208;SNAs typically involve a single DNA sequence which greatly limits its functions as either targeting purpose or gene regulation. In response, we proposed here a third generation, supramolecular spherical nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) with two different sequences to achieve both above&#8208;mentioned functions. Specifically, we constructed a series of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures by coupling a cell membrane receptor (i.e., nucleolin)&#8208;recognizing aptamer (AS1411)&#8208;modified adamantine as targeting probe and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antisense&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to specifically inhibit the overexpression of HER2 proteins for gene regulations. In comparison to the m&#8208;SNA precursors, such Supra&#8208;SNA structures exhibited enhanced levels of resistance to nuclease degradation, cellular uptake, gene regulation capabilities and tumor retention capacity. We demonstrated that Supra&#8208;SNAs exhibited optimal cell suppression rates and cell apoptosis via a phosphatidylinositol 3&#8208;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The well&#8208;defined molecular structures provide an attractive platform for investigating interrelationship between structure and property at the molecular level.

         <title>Pentagon&#8208;Rich Caged Carbon Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized caged carbon catalysts enriched with pentagonal structures and investigated their catalytic activity for the high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction. The origin of the ORR activity of the pentagon&#8208;containing carbon catalyst lies in the spin that localizes in the pentagon ring. The SOMO of pentagon&#8208;containing molecules is characterized by &#960; orbitals and is energetically low, which promotes effective oxygen adsorption.







Abstract
The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non&#8208;platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts involves introducing five&#8208;membered ring structures with spin into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage&#8208;like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring&#8208;containing C60 and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin in improving activity. The concept of spin and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts.

         <title>Silylene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide Emitters: From Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Dual Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of emissive N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene Cu(I) amide complexes herald a significant advancement in the domain of linear two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) emitters, characterized by their thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and dual emissive properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report the inaugural instance of N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi)&#8208;coordinated copper amide emitters (2&#8211;5). These complexes exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and singlet&#8208;triplet dual emission in anaerobic conditions. The NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;diphenylamide (2) complex demonstrates TADF with a very small &#916;EST gap (0.01&#8197;eV), an absolute quantum yield of 11&#8201;%, a radiative rate of 2.55&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, and a short &#964;TADF of 0.45&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state. The dual emissive complexes (3&#8211;5) achieve an absolute quantum yield of up to 20&#8201;% in the solid state with a kISC rate of 1.82&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and exhibit room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with lifetimes up to 9&#8197;ms. The gradual decrease in the intensity of the triplet state of complex 3 under controlled oxygen exposure demonstrates its potential for future oxygen&#8208;sensing applications. Complexes 2 and 3 have been further utilized to fabricate converted LEDs, paving the way for future OLED production using newly synthesized NHSi&#8208;Cu&#8208;amides.

Two for one job: DtpM and XrdM are two bacterial enzymes that have different structures but still catalyze the same reaction: the amide N&#8208;methylation of dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs). Ligand binding to both enzymes was studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, mutagenesis and activity assays. The results suggest that different organisms developed distinct methyltransferases for the same task by convergent evolution.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolone (DTP) natural products are produced by several different bacteria and have potent antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. While the amide of their DTP core can be methylated to fine&#8208;tune bioactivity, the enzyme responsible for the amide N&#8208;methylation has remained elusive in most taxa. Here, we identified the amide methyltransferase XrdM that is responsible for xenorhabdin (XRD) methylation in Xenorhabdus doucetiae but encoded outside of the XRD gene cluster. XrdM turned out to be isofunctional with the recently reported methyltransferase DtpM, that is involved in the biosynthesis of the DTP thiolutin, although its X&#8208;ray structure is unrelated to that of DtpM. To investigate the structural basis for ligand binding in both enzymes, we used X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic activity assays. Our study expands the limited knowledge of post&#8208;non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) amide methylation in DTP biosynthesis and reveals an example of convergent evolution of two structurally completely different enzymes for the same reaction in different organisms.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). An interface chemistry modulation strategy is proposed to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. The strong interactions significantly promote internal electron exchanges, and the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2. This enhancement promotes a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*.







Abstract
Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as highly promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure incorporates Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface, where strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges at the heterojunction interface between &#8208;OH and &#8208;O groups. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization leads to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8722;CoOOH@NiOOH, demonstrates ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity over 11.9 times greater than the initial cobalt oxyhydroxide. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkable durability (1000&#8197;hours at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and quick charge performances.

         <dc:description>
The spin exchange effect between diatomic sites activates the diatomic catalysts, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of triiodide and facilitating the iodine conversion reaction. Utilizing MnZn&#8722;NC diatomic catalysts, the zinc&#8208;iodine battery demonstrates both a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8722;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8722;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8722;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8722;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.

         <dc:description>
A strategy for the fabrication of rewritable surface&#8208;initiated polymer brushes with a relatively high grafting density grafted from both nanoparticles and macroscopic surfaces has been developed. The incorporation of a dynamic covalent chemical linkage at the &#8220;root&#8221; of the polymer brushes would, in principle, enable unlimited rounds of degrafting and regrafting of polymer brushes.







Abstract
Surface grafting of polymer brushes drastically modifies surface properties, including wettability, compatibility, responsiveness, etc. A broad variety of functionalities can be introduced to the surface via different types of polymers. Bringing together properties of two or more types of polymer brushes to one surface opens up even more possibilities in brush&#8208;modified materials. However, while it is generally feasible to introduce several chemical compositions along the brushes via copolymerization, it is challenging to vary the types of polymer brushes along a surface. Although previous studies have demonstrated binary brushes via orthogonal polymerization techniques or partial deactivation/regrafting, they commonly limit the number of polymer types to two. Here, we propose a strategy to introduce dynamic covalent diketoenamine linkages at the root of polymer brushes. The grafting density could be precisely tuned during surface functionalization. The surface&#8208;anchored polymer brushes were cleaved by the addition of small molecule amines. New polymer brushes can be regrafted from the surface following refunctionalization of exposed sites. The maneuverability allows tuning of the types and densities of the polymer brushes, pointing the way to the preparation of a new generation of well&#8208;defined brush&#8208;modified materials with mixed grafts, with potential applications in the design of smart materials and surfaces.

         <title>Dynamically Stabilizing Oxygen Atoms in Silver Catalyst for Highly Selective and Durable CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pulsed&#8208;bias technique was developed to dynamically stabilize oxygen atoms in silver (Ag) electrodes under operando conditions, allowing to achieve highly selective and durable electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysis.







Abstract
Oxide derived catalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which, it is found that residue oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in regulating the catalyst's electronic structure and thus the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst under cathodic CO2RR potentials makes it unstable during continuous electrolysis, greatly hindering its practical industrial applications. In this work, we develop a pulsed&#8208;bias technique that is able to dynamically stabilize the residue oxygen atoms in oxide derived catalyst during electrochemical CO2RR. As a result, the oxide derived catalyst under pulsed bias exhibits super catalytic stability in catalyzing electrochemical CO2RR, while keeping excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Induced Flexible and Twisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functionalized Carbon Dots with Customized&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the exciting discovery of the surface modification of carbon dots drives the construction of an assembly asymmetric environment to realize a full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the aggregated state. Moreover, we explore panchromatic as well as white&#8208;light CPL applications of light emitting diodes and large flexible optical films, which provide new material strategies for virtual reality, medical imaging, and scientific visualization, among others.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has numerous applications in optical data storage, quantum computing, bioresponsive imaging, liquid crystal displays, and backlights in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. In addition to their competitive optical properties, carbon dots (CDs) benefit from simple and low&#8208;cost preparation, facile post&#8208;modification, and excellent resistance to photo&#8208; and chemical bleaching after carbonization. Combining the superior optical performance with polarization peculiarities through hierarchical structure engineering is imperative for the development of CDs. In this study, hydrophobic interactions of aromatic ligands, which participate in the surface&#8208;ligand post&#8208;modification process on the ground&#8208;state chiral carbon core, are employed to drive the oriented assembly. Furthermore, the residual chiral amides on CDs form multiple hydrogen bonds during gradual aggregation, causing the assembled materials to form an asymmetric bending structure. Superficial ligands interfere with the optical dynamics of the exciton radiation transition and stabilize the excited state of the assembled materials to achieve a circularly polarized signal. The linkage ligands overcome the frequent aggregation&#8208;induced quenching phenomenon that present difficulties in conventional CDs, facilitate the assembly of self&#8208;supporting films, and improve chiral optical expression. The full&#8208;color and white CPL are manipulated by simply adjusting the functional groups of the ligands, which also illustrates the versatility of the post&#8208;modification strategy. Finally, large chiral flexible films and multicolor chiral light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the stable chiral powder phosphors were constructed, thereby providing feasible materials and technical support for flexible 3D displays.

         <title>Rare Earth Er&#8208;Nd Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;light Induced CO2 Reduction to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2)</title>

         <dc:description>
The dual single atoms (SAs) catalyst Er3Nd1/CN is designed and synthesized by atomic confinement and coordination strategies, and exhibits record&#8208;level rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH in CO2 photoreduction. Synchrotron radiation, in&#8208;situ test, and density functional theory (DFT)calculations indicate that weaker *CO adsorption on the Nd tends to desorb and migrate to Er site for C&#8722;C coupling, which is the key to ethanol synthesis.







Abstract
Efficient synthesis of CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via photochemical CO2 reduction holds promise for achieving carbon neutrality but remains challenging. Here, we present rare earth dual single atoms (SAs) catalysts containing ErN6 and NdN6 moieties, fabricated via an atom&#8208;confinement and coordination method. The dual Er&#8722;Nd SAs catalysts exhibit unprecedented generation rates of 1761.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 987.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for CH3CH2OH and CH3OH, respectively. Through a combination of theoretical calculation, XAFS analysis, aberration&#8208;corrected HAADF&#8208;STEM, and in&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Er SAs facilitate charge transfer, serving as active centers for C&#8722;C bond formation, while Nd SAs provide the necessary *CO for C&#8722;C coupling in C2H5OH synthesis under visible light. Furthermore, the experiment and DFT calculation elucidate that the variety of electronic states induced by 4&#8201;f orbitals of the Er SAs and the p&#8722;f orbital hybridization of Er&#8722;N moieties enable the formation of charge&#8208;transfer channel. Therefore, this study sheds light on the pivotal role of *CO adsorption in achieving efficient conversion from CO2 to CnH2n+1OH (n=1, 2) via a novel rare earth&#8208;based dual SAs photocatalysis approach.

         <title>Non&#8208;Natural MUC1 Glycopeptide Homogeneous Cancer Vaccine with Enhanced Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non&#8208;natural glycopeptide antigen with a site&#8208;specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.







Abstract
Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor&#8208;associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non&#8208;selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1&#8208;based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure&#8208;guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide.

&lt;p&gt;A chemically defined vaccine is prepared by combining the structural design of a non-natural glycopeptide antigen with a site-specific protein modification. The resulting vaccine, which contains a single copy of the antigen, is both prophylactically and therapeutically effective. Importantly, this approach refutes a prevailing dogma that glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent presentation of antigens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycopeptides derived from the glycoprotein mucin-1 (MUC1) have shown potential as tumor-associated antigens for cancer vaccine development. However, their low immunogenicity and non-selective conjugation to carriers present significant challenges for the clinical efficacy of MUC1-based vaccines. Here, we introduce a novel vaccine candidate based on a structure-guided design of an artificial antigen derived from MUC1 glycopeptide. This engineered antigen contains two non-natural amino acids and has an &#945;-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-glycosidic bond, where sulfur replaces the conventional oxygen atom linking the peptide backbone to the sugar &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylgalactosamine. The glycopeptide is then specifically conjugated to the immunogenic protein carrier CRM&lt;sub&gt;197&lt;/sub&gt; (Cross-Reactive Material 197), a protein approved for human use. Conjugation involves selective reduction and re-bridging of a disulfide in CRM&lt;sub&gt;197&lt;/sub&gt;, allowing the attachment of a single copy of MUC1. This strategy results in a chemically defined vaccine while maintaining both the structural integrity and immunogenicity of the protein carrier. The vaccine elicits a robust Th1-like immune response in mice and generates antibodies capable of recognizing human cancer cells expressing tumor-associated MUC1. When tested in mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer, the vaccine is effective both as a prophylactic and therapeutic use, significantly delaying tumor growth. In therapeutic applications, improved outcomes were observed when the vaccine was combined with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor. Our strategy reduces batch-to-batch variability and enhances both immunogenicity and therapeutic potential. This site-specific approach disputes a prevailing dogma where glycoconjugate vaccines require multivalent display of antigens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with a Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 2&#8201;% through Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic overall water splitting system is successfully developed using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of PMA2PbI4/MoS2 as the H2 evolution photocatalyst and theWO3/RuOx as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors is a promising approach for converting solar energy to clean energy. However, challenges such as sluggish water oxidation kinetics and limited light absorption of photocatalyst cause low solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Herein, we develop a photocatalytic overall water splitting system using I3&#8722;/I&#8722; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of benzylammonium lead iodide (PMA2PbI4, PMA=C6H5CH2NH2) loaded with MoS2 (PMA2PbI4/MoS2) as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, and the RuOx&#8208;loaded WO3 (WO3/RuOx) as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07&#8201;%. This work provides a detour route for photocatalytic water splitting with the help of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; shuttle redox couple in the halide perovskite HI splitting system and enlightens one to integrate and utilize multi catalytic strategies for solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

         <title>Pulsed EPR Methods in the Angstrom to Nanometre Scale Shed Light on the Conformational Flexibility of a Fluoride Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride sensing riboswitch was investigated by EPR&#8208;based distance measurements. Electron&#8208;electron double resonance revealed preorganisation of the stem structures and conformational flexibility while electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance demonstrates low structural heterogeneity around the fluoride site and distinct differences between the crystal and solution structures.







Abstract
Riboswitches control gene regulation upon external stimuli such as environmental factors or ligand binding. The fluoride sensing riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila is a complex regulatory RNA proposed to be involved in resistance to F&#8722; cytotoxicity. The details of structure and dynamics underpinning the regulatory mechanism are currently debated. Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch. PELDOR (pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance) revealed a similar preorganisation of the sensing domain in three forms, i.e. the free aptamer, the Mg2+&#8208;bound apo, and the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. 19F&#8197;ENDOR (electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance) was used to investigate the active site structure of the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. Distance distributions without a priori structural information were compared with in silico modelling of spin label conformations based on the crystal structure. While PELDOR, probing the periphery of the RNA fold, revealed conformational flexibility of the RNA backbone, ENDOR indicated low structural heterogeneity at the ligand binding site. Overall, the combination of PELDOR and ENDOR with sub&#8208;angstrom precision gave insight into structural organisation and flexibility of a riboswitch, not easily attainable by other biophysical techniques.

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF&#8208;8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF&#8208;8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43&#8197;m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane. Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying the reductive amination of acetone with methylamine as nitrogen source using electrochemistry revealed the catalytic activity of 1&#8197;ppm Pb. In addition, the effects of the applied potential and the cathode materials on the reaction were investigated. Finally, the results were transferred to the electrochemical hydrogenation of acetone.







Abstract
The electrochemical hydrogenation (e&#8208;hydrogenation) of unsaturated compounds like imines or carbonyls presents a benign reduction method. It enables direct use of electrons as reducing agent, water as proton source, while bypassing the need for elevated temperatures or pressures. In this contribution, we discuss the active species in electrocatalytic reductive amination with the transformation of acetone and methylamine as model reaction. Surprisingly, lead impurities in the ppm&#8208;range proved to possess a significant effect in e&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the influence of applied potential and cathode material in presence of 1&#8197;ppm Pb was investigated. Finally, we transferred the insights to the reduction of acetone manifesting comparable observations as for imine reduction. The results suggest that previous studies on electrochemical reduction in the presence of lead electrodes should be re&#8208;evaluated.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Ball Milling Enables an Ultra&#8208;Fast Wittig Olefination Under Ambient and Solvent&#8208;free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a protocol for a solvent&#8208;free mechanically induced Wittig olefination under ambient conditions often without the need of ylide pre&#8208;formation with a 30&#8197;seconds reaction time under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions.







Abstract
30&#8197;Seconds to success!&#8212;The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion. A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30&#8197;seconds.

         <title>Exploring Aqueous Solution&#8208;Processed Pseudohalide Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward X&#8208;Ray Detection with High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first high&#8208;temperature hybrid pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskite (HPREDP) ferroelectric was obtained by rationally designed. Further, we explored application of HPREDP ferroelectric in X&#8208;ray detection, and achieved the highest sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (among all hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors).







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence. However, their potential for X&#8208;ray detection remains unexplored, and the low Curie temperature (TC) limits the performance window for PREDP ferroelectrics. Here, by applying the chemical regulation strategies involving halogen substitution on the organic cation and Rb/Cs substitution to the PREDP [(R)&#8208;M3HQ]2RbEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;M3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] with a low TC of 285&#8197;K, a novel 3D PREDP ferroelectric [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ=(R)&#8208;N&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium] are successfully synthesized, for which the TC reaches 344&#8197;K. More importantly, such a strategy endowed [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 with notable X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Centimeter&#8208;sized [(R)&#8208;CM3HQ]2CsEu(NO3)6 single crystals fabricated from aqueous solutions demonstrated a sensitivity of 1307&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detectable dose rate of 152&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, the highest sensitivity reported for hybrid double perovskite ferroelectric detectors. This work positions PREDPs as promising candidates for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly optoelectronic materials and also offers substantial insights into the interaction between structure, composition, and functionality in ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Brush&#8208;Like Polymeric Gels Enabled Photonic Crystals toward Ultrasensitive Cosolvent Chromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) was constructed by using the assembled ZnS@SiO2 nanoparticles as a photonic crystal template and in situ polymerizing oligo ethylene glycol acrylate. Owing to the cosolvency&#8208;induced incremental stretching of acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol side&#8208;chains in ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, the prepared BPPG exhibited sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) exhibit dynamic chromism upon trigger by various solvents, showing potential applications in qualitative identification and quantitative analysis of multicomponent solvents. However, distinguishing similar solvents, especially traces of cosolvents, remains challenging due to the limited sensitivity of RPCs. To address this, we herein introduce brush&#8208;like polymeric gels inside photonic crystals, forming a brush&#8208;like polymeric photonic gel (BPPG) that can trace tiny component changes. In this BPPG system, the acrylate backbones and polyethylene glycol (PEG) side&#8208;chains stretch incrementally due to the cosolvency of ethanol&#8208;water mixtures, resulting in highly sensitive chromatic responses within ethanol&#8208;rich concentrations. With water content varying slightly from 0 to 1&#8197;vol&#8201;%, the reflection wavelength of BPPG can sharply redshift over 30&#8197;nm, leading to very noticeable changes in structural color. This enhanced sensitivity makes BPPG suitable for real&#8208;time, in situ purity monitoring of absolute ethanol during storage, transportation, and other applications.

         <title>Atomic Printing Strategy Achieves Precise Anchoring of Dual&#8208;Copper Atoms on C2N Structure for Efficient CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual&#8208;atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. The dual&#8208;atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs RHE.







Abstract
Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable&#8208;type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual&#8208;atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C2N cavity as anchoring &#8220;pincers&#8221; to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu2&#8208;C2N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO2RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C&#8722;C coupling and guarantees FEC2+ (90.8&#8201;%) and FEC2H4. (71.7&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.10&#8197;V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu2 site would be subtly flipped during CO2RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization.

     alt="Atomic Printing Strategy Achieves Precise Anchoring of Dual-Copper Atoms on C2N Structure for Efficient CO2 Reduction to Ethylene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We successfully develop a universal atomic imprinting synthesis strategy for the preparation of dual-atom catalysts, with a particular focus on the synthesis of a dual-atom Cu catalyst for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to ethylene. The dual-atom copper catalyst developed in this research exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance, achieving a remarkable 71.7&#8201;% ethylene Faradaic efficiency at an applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; RHE.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated metal sites catalysts (IMSCs) play crucial role in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, with potential industrial applications. However, tunable synthesis strategies for IMSCs are limited. Herein, we present an atomic printing strategy that draws inspiration from the ancient Chinese &#8220;movable-type printing technology&#8221;. Selecting customizable combinations of metal atoms as metal precursors from an extensive binuclear metal library. A series of dual-atom catalysts were prepared by utilizing the edge nitrogen atoms in the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N cavity as anchoring &#8220;pincers&#8221; to capture metal atoms. To prove utility, the dual atom catalyst Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N is investigated as electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalyst. The synergistic interaction of dual Cu atoms promotes C&#8722;C coupling and guarantees FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt; (90.8&#8201;%) and FE&lt;sub&gt;C2H4&lt;/sub&gt;. (71.7&#8201;%) at &#8722;1.10&#8197;V vs RHE. DFT calculations revealed the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site would be subtly flipped during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR for enhancing *CO adsorption and dimerization. We validate that atomic printing strategies are applicable to wide range of metal combinations, representing a significant advancement in the development of IMSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying the Hydration&#8208;Dependent Dynamics of Cu Migration and Activity in Zeolite Omega for the Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega's (Cu&#8208;omega) activity in partial methane oxidation via oxygen looping significantly varies with the conditions applied. Using primarily in situ anomalous x&#8208;ray powder diffraction (AXRPD) the source of this divergent behavior is revealed to be due to a migration of Cu throughout the framework, which in turn is predominantly controlled by the system's degree of hydration.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;exchanged zeolite omega (Cu&#8208;omega) is a potent material for the selective conversion of methane&#8208;to&#8208;methanol (MtM) via the oxygen looping approach. However, its performance exhibits substantial variation depending on the operational conditions. Under an isothermal temperature regime, Cu&#8208;omega demonstrates subdued activity below 230&#8201;&#176;C, but experiences a remarkable increase in activity at 290&#8201;&#176;C. Applying a high&#8208;temperature activation protocol at 450&#8201;&#176;C causes a rapid deactivation of the material. This behavioral divergence is investigated by combining reactivity studies, neutron diffraction and in situ high&#8208;resolution anomalous X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (HR&#8208;AXRPD), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, to reveal that the migration of Cu throughout the framework is the primary cause of these behaviors, which in turn is predominantly governed by the degree of hydration of the system. This work suggests that control over the Cu migration throughout the zeolite framework may be harnessed to significantly increase the activity of Cu&#8208;omega by generating more active sites for the MtM conversion. These results underscore the power of in situ HR&#8208;AXRPD for unraveling the behavior of materials under reaction conditions and suggest that a re&#8208;evaluation of Cu&#8208;zeolites priorly deemed inactive for the MtM conversion across a broader range of conditions and looping protocols may be warranted.

We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Measuring Kinetics under Vibrational Strong Coupling: Testing for a Change in the Nucleophilicity of Water and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) is reported to modify chemical reactivity, but its mode of action is not understood. Here, we provide a methodology using fixed&#8208;width optical cavities for measuring kinetics under VSC in a reproducible way. The large kinetic dataset showed that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of alcohols.







Abstract
Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to change the rate of organic reactions. However, a lack of convenient and reliable methods to measure reaction kinetics under VSC makes it challenging to obtain mechanistic insight into its influence, hindering progress in the field. Here, we use recently developed fixed&#8208;width optical cavities to obtain large kinetic datasets under VSC with small errors (&#177;1&#8211;5&#8201;%) in an operationally simple manner using UV/Vis spectroscopy. The setup is used to test whether VSC changes a fundamental kinetic property of polar reactions, nucleophilicity, for water and alcohols, species commonly used in VSC&#8208;modified chemistry. We determined the rate constants for nucleophilic capture with a library of benzhydrilium ions as reference electrophiles with and without strong coupling of the nucleophile's key vibrations. For all investigated combinations of electrophiles and nucleophiles, only minor changes in the observed rate constants of the reactions were observed independently of the coupled bands. These results indicate that VSC does not substantially alter the nucleophilicity of water and alcohols, suggesting that polar reactions are modified through other, presently unknown mechanisms. Fixed&#8208;width cavities allow for convenient and reproducible UV/Vis kinetics, facilitating mechanistic studies of VSC&#8208;modified chemistry.

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Enhancing d/p&#8208;2&#960;* Orbitals Hybridization via Strain Engineering for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>

Lattice strain regulates the orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics.







Abstract
The photoconversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products using solar energy is a promising strategy to address both energy and environmental challenges. However, the strongly adsorbed CO2 frequently impedes the seamless advancement of the subsequent reaction by significantly increasing the reaction activation energy. Here, we present a BiFeO3 material with lattice strain that collaboratively regulates the d/p&#8208;2&#960;* orbitals hybridization between metal sites and *CO2 as well as *COOH intermediates to achieve rapid conversion of solidly adsorbed CO2 to critical *COOH intermediates, accelerating the overall CO2 reduction kinetics. Quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculation reveals that the optimized Fe sites enhance the adsorption and activation effect of CO2, and continuous internal electrons are rapidly transferred to the reaction sites and injected into the surface *CO2 and *COOH under the condition of illumination, which promotes the rapid formation and stability of *COOH. Certainly, the performance of CO2 photoreduction to CO is improved by 12.81&#8208;fold compared with the base material. This work offers a new perspective for the rapid photoreduction process of strongly adsorbed CO2.

Tryptophan nitration chemistry of an economically impactful heme enzyme, TxtE, has been modeled utilizing synthetic heme mimics by Sam&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser, Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409430). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

         <title>Reactivity Inside Molecular Flasks: Acceleration Modes and Types of Selectivity Obtainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular flasks are hollow supramolecular structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions, often exhibiting complex catalytic mechanisms and selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. This Review discusses the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, and showcases the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through their use, focusing on examples relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe this summary will facilitate the design and development of novel catalysis examples inside molecular flasks







Abstract
There is increasing interest in the discovery and application of molecular flasks&#8211;supramolecular host structures capable of catalyzing organic reactions. Reminiscent of enzymes due to possessing a host cavity akin to an active site, molecular flasks can exhibit complex catalytic mechanisms and in many cases provide selectivity not achievable in bulk solvent. In this Review, we aim to organize the increasingly diverse examples through a two&#8208;part structure. In part one, we provide an overview of the different acceleration modes that operate within molecular flasks, while in part two we showcase, through selected examples, the different types of selectivity that are obtainable through the use of molecular flasks. Particular attention is given to examples that are relevant to current challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. We believe that this structure makes the field more approachable and thus will stimulate the development of novel applications of molecular flasks.

         <title>Celebrating Ten Years of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Solar Energy Conversion: Past, Present and Future</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the first report of covalent organic frameworks as photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 2014, a new type of &#8220;soft photocatalyst&#8221; was released. Here, a historical overview as well as the current state of the art and future perspectives on various photocatalytic reactions including CO2 reduction (CO2RR), overall water splitting, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction (ORR), and alcohol oxidation, are given.







Abstract
Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, the replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest, both societally and scientifically. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction was reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; based on porous polymers in general. In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field since its inception in 2014. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction, and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learned for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field of &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221; are given.

         <title>Disorder Over Pore Size: Boosting Supercapacitor Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Forse and co&#8208;workers show that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. This discovery provides a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors, guiding the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials.







Abstract
The urgent need for efficient energy storage systems has spotlighted supercapacitors and nanostructured porous carbon materials. These materials require structural optimization to enhance their performance and lifespan, necessitating advanced design and synthesis techniques. In a recent publication, Forse and co&#8208;workers reveal that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances their capacitance performance, suggesting that optimizing structural disorder is key to developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors. This study innovatively shows that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. The investigation of multiple nanoporous carbons from a range of different suppliers showcases the generalizability of the findings. Annealing treatment further confirms that the capacitance enhancement is due to structural disorder. This discovery guides the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials, providing a new direction for the future development of supercapacitors.

         <title>dGAE(297&#8211;391) Tau Fragment Promotes Formation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8208;Like Tau Filaments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro methods for obtaining disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates of the microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau are needed for diagnostics and drug development against tauopathies. We show that the chronic traumatic encephalopathy type II fold can be propagated onto full&#8208;length tau by seeding the aggregation with the tau fragment dGAE. The work brings us closer to in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific tau filament types.







Abstract
The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T cells. This work demonstrates that in vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.

         <title>Fused Aromatic and Antiaromatic Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly linked and fused dimers were synthesized for aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex and antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base. The fused dimers show larger electronic interactions but the respective antiaromatic and aromatic characters are well preserved.







Abstract
Singly&#8208;linked aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the reductive coupling of 16&#8208;brominated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was oxidized to a stable diradical with PbO2. As the first example of fused smaragdyrin dimer, a fused [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the oxidation of a CuCl&#8208;BF2 complex dimer with FeCl3 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. After removal of the BF2 group, the singly&#8208;linked and fused aromatic dimers were oxidized to the corresponding antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base dimers. The first oxidation and reduction potentials of these dimers are split depending upon the intramolecular electronic interactions, which are larger for the fused dimers. Despite the large electronic interactions, the aromatic and antiaromatic characters are well preserved in the fused dimers.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Doping in Robust Open&#8208;Shell Ladder&#8208;Type Oligoaniline Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;doping mechanism is introduced in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. This mechanism, facilitated by resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer, enables efficient self&#8208;doping of the organic electronic compound, resulting in a durable conductive material without the need for an external dopant. The findings open new possibilities for creating organic conductors that are both high&#8208;performing and long&#8208;lasting.







Abstract
A novel resonance&#8208;assisted self&#8208;doping mechanism has been demonstrated in ladder&#8208;type oligoaniline&#8208;derived organic conductors. The new class of compounds has a unique structure incorporating acidic phenolic hydroxyl groups into the ladder&#8208;type cyclohexadiene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diimine core, enabling efficient resonance&#8208;assisted proton transfer and electronic doping without the need for external dopants. Mechanistic and computational studies confirm the open&#8208;shell, zwitterionic nature of the self&#8208;doped state and the significant role played by the dielectric environment. This new self&#8208;doping mechanism allows for higher stability and durability in the material&#8216;s electronic performance. The self&#8208;doped form retains durability under harsh conditions and maintains its properties over extended periods of time.

         <title>Mechanistically Different Mechanochromophores Enable Calibration and Validation of Molecular Forces in Glassy Polymers and Elastomeric Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with covalently incorporated donor&#8208;acceptor torsional springs allow for real&#8208;time monitoring of forces, that are calibrated using known spiropyran mechanophores. This concept is demonstrated using glassy, entangled polymers and elastomeric networks.







Abstract
Sterically distorted donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;systems, termed DA springs, can be progressively planarized under mechanical load causing a bathochromic shift of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. By combining theory and experiment, we here use a simple linear force calibration for two different conformational mechanochromophores to determine molecular forces in polymers from the mechanochromic shift in PL wavelength during multiple uniaxial tensile tests. Two systems are used, i) a highly entangled linear glassy polyphenylene and ii) a covalent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane network. The mean forces estimated by this method are validated using known threshold forces for the mechanochemical ring&#8208;opening reactions of two different spiropyran force probes. The agreement between both approaches underlines that these DA springs provide the unique opportunity for the online monitoring of local molecular forces present in diverse polymer matrices.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Hyponitrite Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Hyponitrite Reactivity: The Fe&#8208;hyponitrite complex 3 was generated from preformed hyponitrite and characterized by spectroscopic methods and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Upon protonation or oxidation, quantitative N2O formation occurs. Lewis acidity of iron plays a key role in reactivity, as a more Lewis acidic iron center leads to the cleavage of the N=N bond of hyponitrite.







Abstract
Flavodiiron NO reductases (FNORs) are important enzymes in microbial pathogenesis, as they equip microbes with resistance to the human immune defense agent nitric oxide (NO). Despite many efforts, intermediates that would provide insight into how the non&#8208;heme diiron active sites of FNORs reduce NO to N2O could not be identified. Computations predict that iron&#8208;hyponitrite complexes are the key species, leading from NO to N2O. However, the coordination chemistry of non&#8208;heme iron centers with hyponitrite is largely unknown. In this study, we report the reactivity of two non&#8208;heme iron complexes with preformed hyponitrite. In the case of [Fe(TPA)(CH3CN)2](OTf)2, cleavage of hyponitrite and formation of an Fe2(NO)2 diamond core is observed. With less Lewis&#8208;acidic [Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2(OTf)2] (2), reaction with Na2N2O2 in polar aprotic solvent leads to the formation of a red complex, 3. X&#8208;ray crystallography shows that 3 is a tetranuclear iron&#8208;hyponitrite complex, [{Fe2(BMPA&#8208;PhO)2}2(&#956;&#8208;N2O2)](OTf)2, with a unique hyponitrite binding mode. This species provided the unique opportunity to us to study the interaction of hyponitrite with non&#8208;heme iron centers and the reactivity of the bound hyponitrite ligand. Here, either protonation or oxidation of 3 is found to induce N2O formation, supporting the hypothesis that hyponitrite is a viable intermediate in NO reduction.

Li[HC2O5] is the first hydrogen&#8208;containing pyrocarbonate. It was synthesized by a reaction of CO2 and H2O with Li2[CO3] at moderate pressures and temperatures together with an anhydrous lithium pyrocarbonate (Li2[C2O5]) in a DAC. The crystal structure was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and confirmed by DFT&#8208;based calculations. The structure refinement and DFT calculations show that in Li[HC2O5] a symmetric hydrogen bond is present in the hydrogenated pyrocarbonate anion [HC2O5]&#8722;.

         <title>An Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev&#8208;Based Method for Inversion of Regioselectivity in Stereospecific Alkene 1,2&#8208;Aminohydroxylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to those observed using epoxidation initiation 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylation protocols. The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2&#8208;aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Highly Specific Bioorthogonal Catalysis Inside Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a copper center and specific substrate binding domain, could perform highly&#8208;specific abiotic transformation inside cells, particularly in a gain&#8208;of&#8208;functions. Importantly, Cu&#8208;MIEs exclusively catalyze target substrates and retain its superb performance even in the presence of copper&#8208;poisoning molecules like glutathione (GSH).







Abstract
Transition metal catalysts (TMCs) mediated bioorthogonal catalysis expand the chemical possibilities within cells. Developing synthetic TMCs tools that emulate the efficiency and specificity of natural metalloenzymes is a rewarding yet challenging endeavor. Here, we highlight the potential of molecularly imprinted enzyme mimics (MIEs) containing a Cu center and specific substrate binding domain, for conducing dimethylpropargyloxycarbonyl (DmProc) cleavage reactions within cells. Our studies reveal that the Cu&#8208;MIEs act as highly specific guides, precisely catalyzing target substrates, even in glutathione (GSH)&#8208;rich cellular environments. By adapting templates similar to the target substrates, we evolved Cu&#8208;MIEs activity to a high level and provided a method to broaden its scope to other unique substrates. This system was applied to a thyroid hormone (T3)&#8208;responsive gene switch model, inducing firefly luciferase expression by T3 in cells. This approach verifies that MIEs effectively rescue DmProc&#8208;bearing T3 prodrugs and seamlessly integrating themself into cellular biocatalytic networks.

         <title>A High&#8208;Quality Photoswitchable Probe that Selectively and Potently Regulates the Transcription Factor ROR&#947;</title>

Azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable inverse agonists of the retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) enable optical control of gene expression mediated by this important nuclear hormone receptor, with excellent potency and selectivity.







Abstract
Retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) is a nuclear hormone receptor with multiple biological functions in circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and immunity. Its cyclic temporal role in circadian rhythms, and cell&#8208;specific activity in the immune system, make it an intriguing target for spatially and temporally localised pharmacology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor &#947; (ROR&#947;) is a nuclear hormone receptor with multiple biological functions in circadian clock regulation, inflammation, and immunity. Its cyclic temporal role in circadian rhythms, and cell-specific activity in the immune system, make it an intriguing target for spatially and temporally localised pharmacology. To create tools that can study ROR&#947; biology with appropriate spatiotemporal resolution, we designed light-dependent inverse ROR&#947; agonists by building azobenzene photoswitches into ligand consensus structures. Optimizations gave photoswitchable ROR&#947; inhibitors combining a large degree of potency photocontrol, with remarkable on-target potency, and excellent selectivity over related off-target receptors.

         <title>Hydroaminoalkylation for Amine Functionalization of Vinyl&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene Enables Direct Access to Responsive Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a novel method for producing functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) via a 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE). Our approach addresses current synthetic challenges by enabling the efficient incorporation of amine functionalities into crystalline PEs in the melt phase. These functional materials have diverse potential applications and here we show that aminated PEs exhibit enhanced material properties, and pH responsive properties results in antibacterial PE films.







Abstract
While functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) exhibit valuable characteristics, the constraints of existing synthetic approaches limit the variety of readily incorporated functionality. New methods to generate functionalized PEs are required to afford new applications of this common material. We report 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE) as a method to produce amine&#8208;terminated PE. VTPEs with molecular weights between 2200&#8211;16800&#8197;g/mol are successfully aminated using solvent&#8208;free conditions. Our catalytic system is efficient for the installation of both aromatic and aliphatic amines, and can be carried out on multigram scale. The associating amine functional groups afford modified material properties, as measured by water contact angle, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polymer rheology. The basic amine functionality offers the opportunity to convert inert PE into stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such that the protonation of aminated PE affords the generation of functional antibacterial PE films.

         <title>Dynamic Asymmetric Diamination of Allylic Alcohols through Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis: Diastereo&#8208;Divergent Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzodiazepines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein an unprecedented, catalytic enantioconvergent diamination of racemic allylic alcohols with the construction of two C&#8722;N bonds and 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. This iridium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalytic system operates through an atom&#8208;economical borrowing hydrogen amination/aza&#8208;Michael cascade, and converts readily available phenylenediamines and racemic allylic alcohols to 1,5&#8208;tetrahydrobenzodiazepines in high enantioselectivity. An intriguing solvent&#8208;dependent switch of diastereoselectivity was also observed.

         <title>Rapid Thermal Drying Synthesis of Nonthiolated Spherical Nucleic Acids with Stability Rivaling Thiolated DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal drying, highly stable spherical nucleic acids with a high DNA density were synthesized using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on gold nanoparticles. Applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensors.







Abstract
Attaching DNA oligonucleotides to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) has offered tremendous insights into surface chemistry with resulting bioconjugates serving as critical reagents in biosensors and nanotechnology. While thiolated DNA is generally required to achieve stable conjugates, we herein communicate that using a thermal drying method, a high DNA density and excellent SNA stability was achieved using nonthiolated DNA, rivaling the performance of thiolated DNA such as surviving 1&#8197;M NaCl, 2 month stability in 0.3&#8197;M NaCl and working in 50&#8201;% serum. A poly&#8208;adenine block with as few as two consecutive terminal adenine bases is sufficient for anchoring on AuNPs. By side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison with the salt&#8208;aging method, the conjugation mechanism was attributed to competitive adenine adsorption at high temperature along with an extremely high DNA concentration upon drying. Bioanalytical applications of nonthiolated SNAs were validated in both solution and paper&#8208;based sensor platforms, facilitating cost&#8208;effective applications for SNAs.

         <title>Syntheses of Tungsten Imido Cyclohexylidene Complexes Using Perfluoro&#8208;t&#8208;Butanol or Hexafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;Butanol as Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metathesis&#8208;active W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2 (C6H10=cyclohexylidene) complexes are available in three steps (tungsten oxides&#8594;W(NR)2Cl2&#8594;W(NR)2Cy2&#8594;W(NR)(C6H10)(ORF9)2) without making alkylidene intermediates and without using strong acids. The bisnonafluoro&#8208;t&#8208;butoxide alkylidene complexes can be converted readily into bisalkoxide, bispyrrolide, and MAP complexes through nucleophilic substitutions. Cyclohexylidene complexes appear to be more readily prepared than neophylidene complexes, perhaps in part because any cyclohexene complex formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is isomerized to a cyclohexylidene complex by RF9OH. This mild acid&#8208;catalyzed approach is an attractive alternative to established syntheses of tungsten neopentylidene or neophylidene imido complexes.







Abstract
The fluorinated alcohols, (CF3)3COH (RF9OH) and (CF3)2MeCOH (RF6OH), react with W(NR)2Cy2 (Cy=Cyclohexyl; R=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl or 1&#8208;adamantyl) in C6D6 at 55&#8201;&#176;C to give cyclohexylidene complexes. Traditional routes to terminal alkylidene complexes (neopentylidene or neophylidene) have used either triflic acid or HCl (rarely), but relatively weak fluorinated acids are sufficient and active bisalkoxide catalysts are therefore prepared directly. An &#945; hydrogen abstraction reaction to give a cyclohexylidene complex from a biscyclohexyl complex appears to be as facile as &#945; hydrogen abstraction to give a neopentylidene or neophylidene ligand, but isomerization of a cyclohexene formed through &#946; hydrogen abstraction is also a possibility. The ORF9 ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me2Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X&#8208;ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)2Cy2, W(NAr)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAr)(ORF6)2(C6H10)(ArNH2), W(NAd)(ORF9)2(C6H10)(AdNH2), W(NAr)(O&#8208;i&#8208;PrF6)3Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;1&#8208;Me2Pyr)2(C6H10) (C6H10=cyclohexylidene).

The OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt; ligands can be replaced readily with dimethylpyrrolide (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pyr) or other more basic alkoxides. Single crystal X-ray studies were carried out on W(NAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, W(NAr)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAr)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(ArNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAd)(OR&lt;sub&gt;F9&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)(AdNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), W(NAr)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;F6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cy, and W(NAd)(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pyr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=cyclohexylidene).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Stable Diazo Peptides as Selective Probes of Cysteine Proteases in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is an interesting tool in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology due to its selective and versatile reactivity. We show that chemically stable diazo peptides, which even tolerate 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid, can be generated and used as high&#8208;precision chemical tools.







Abstract
Diazo peptides have been described earlier, however, due to their high reactivity have not been broadly used until today. Here, we report the preparation, properties, and applications of chemically stable internal diazo peptides. Peptidyl phosphoranylidene&#8208;esters and amides were found to react with triflyl azide primarily to novel 3,4&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl&#8208;peptides. Nonaflyl azide instead furnished diazo peptides, which are chemically stable from pH&#8197;1&#8211;14 as amides and from pH&#8197;1&#8211;8 as esters. Thus, diazo peptides prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis were stable to final deprotection with 95&#8201;% trifluoroacetic acid. Diazo peptides with the recognition sequence of caspase&#8208;3 were identified as specific, covalent, and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme at low nanomolar concentrations. A fluorescent diazo peptide entered living cells enabling microscopic imaging and quantification of apoptotic cells via flow cytometry. Thus, internal diazo peptides constitute a novel class of activity&#8208;based probes and enzyme inhibitors useful in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Optical Control of AMPA Glutamate Receptors with a Photoswitchable Tethered Antagonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AMPA receptors are central to excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain but difficult to control with sufficient precision. We developed MP&#8208;GluAblock, a cell specific light&#8208;controllable AMPAR blocker that consists of a photo&#8208;switchable compound (P) that is targeted to specific cells via an expressed membrane&#8208;anchor protein (M). Our approach could be used to dissect AMPAR signaling with unprecedented cellular and spatiotemporal specificity.







Abstract
AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the main drivers of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain, central to synaptic plasticity, and are key drug targets. However, AMPARs are expressed in virtually every neuron in the central nervous system and are activated with complex temporal dynamics, making it difficult to determine their functional roles with sufficient precision. Here we describe a cell specific, light&#8208;controllable competitive antagonist for the AMPA receptor called MP&#8208;GluAblock that combines the temporal precision of a photo&#8208;switchable ligand with the spatial and cellular specificity of a genetically&#8208;encoded membrane&#8208;anchor protein. This tool could pave the way for controlling endogenous AMPARs in neural circuits with cellular, spatial, and temporal specificity.

         <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 49, December 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for direct urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites with electrochemical reduction tolerance by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. The vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species was disclosed.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.

         <dc:description>
Remarkable properties have been predicted for cubic graphite, a hypothetical 3D carbon allotrope composed of carbon cages (C48). A sixty carbons fragment of cubic graphite, benzofused (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208;tris(tribenzo[8]annulene) (TTBA), was now assembled by K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization of tribenzoCOTyne, that contains 36&#8197;carbon atoms properly arranged in a well&#8208;defined cubic graphite cage (C48).







Abstract
A remarkable stereodivergent cyclotrimerization of 9,10&#8208;didehydrotribenzo[8]annulene (tribenzoCOTyne) to the corresponding (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;)&#8208; and (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;benzofused derivatives has been developed by controlling the reaction conditions. While the K+&#8208;mediated cyclotrimerization afforded the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer, using Pd as a catalyst resulted in the (&#945;,&#945;,&#946;)&#8208;derivative. Both stereoisomers were evidenced by spectroscopic data and crystal X&#8208;Ray analysis. The (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer is a fragment of cubic graphite (CG), an elusive 3D carbon allotrope that contains carbon cages, since all of its sixty carbons are part of the structure of CG, and 36&#8197;constitute a part of the C48 molecular cage of CG. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies revealed that the potassium ion would play a key role as a template to favor the formation of the (&#945;,&#945;,&#945;) stereoisomer.

         <title>Unraveling the Configuration Modulation in Spiro&#8208;based Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials hold promise for optoelectronic applications. Among various design strategies, through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) systems offer the potential for enhanced performance. However, the relationship between molecular configuration and TSCT properties remains unclear compared to traditional through&#8208;band charge transfer materials. In this study, we investigated the influence of spatial configuration on TSCT features and electronic properties of triplet excited states in these TSCT materials. By manipulating the spatial arrangement between donor and acceptor segments using different spiro skeletons, a series of TSCT materials (DMB2&#8208;DMB5) was synthesized. Together with the parent molecule, DM&#8208;B, these materials exhibited completely different TADF characteristics, demonstrating the impact of spatial arrangements on their optoelectronic properties. Thus, the external quantum efficiency of these materials ranged from as high as 28.0% (DMB2) to as low as 3.6% (DMB5) due to variations in their TADF characteristics. Our findings highlight the significance of spatial configuration, beyond distance alone, in influencing TSCT properties when donor and acceptor segments are sufficiently close. This insight provides valuable guidance for developing advanced TSCT materials and advancing TADF systems with improved performance and functionality.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from sluggish kinetics, large volume change, and limited specific capacity due to the large radius of Na+. These issues can be solved through using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as electrodes. Herein, an azatriangulenetrione&#8208;containing COF (denoted as CityU&#8208;33) was designed and synthesized as an electrode material for SIBs. Due to its inherent abundance of multiple redox&#8208;active sites and fast intercalation kinetics, CityU&#8208;33 delivered a high discharge capacity of 410.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and showed remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a discharge capacity of 313 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 with approximately 100% retention over 1700 cycles was achieved, making it the top COF electrode material for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric CDC37 inhibitor disrupts chaperone complex to block CDK4/6 maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell division cycle 37 (CDC37) is a member of the molecular chaperone family and acts as a cochaperone of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is overexpressed in many cancer types as a regulator of protein kinase maturation. In this process, CDC37 selectively recognizes and stabilizes protein kinases by forming a HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex. The protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs) of HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;kinase complexes contribute to malignant tumors, as oncogenic kinases in malignant cells depend upon CDC37 expression. Thus, inhibiting CDC37 to disrupt HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex reveals as a promising way to achieve selective inhibition of oncogenic kinase maturation. Herein, we report a small&#8208;molecule CDC37 inhibitor called DDO&#8208;6079 that simultaneously inhibits HSP90&#8208;CDC37 and CDC37&#8208;CDK4/6 chaperone complex by binding to an allosteric site on CDC37. DDO&#8208;6079 selectively inhibited the maturation of multiple oncogenic kinases to escape heat shock response (HSR). Furthermore, DDO&#8208;6079 decreased the thermostability of CDK6, reversed the resistance of CDK6 to palbociclib (a successful CDK4/6 inhibitor) in colorectal cancer cells and exhibited efficacy in vivo. Together, the results revealed that DDO&#8208;6079 is a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule CDC37 inhibitor that disrupts the HSP90&#8208;CDC37&#8208;kinase chaperone complex and provides a new way to block kinase maturation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible and Ultrasensitive Detection of Nitric Oxide Using a Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper describes the use of a highly crystalline conductive 2D copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2) as an ultrasensitive (limit of detection of 1.8 part&#8208;per&#8208;billion), highly selective, reversible, and low power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide (NO) at room temperature. The Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;based sensors retain their sensing performance in the presence of humidity, and exhibit strong signal enhancement towards NO over other highly toxic reactive gases, such as NO2, H2S, SO2, NH3, CO, as well as CO2. Mechanistic investigations of the Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;NO interaction through spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory revealed that the Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) moieties serve as the binding sites for NO sensing, while the Ni&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) MOF analog shows no noticeable response to NO. Overall, these findings provide a significant leap in the development of crystalline metal&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) based conductive 2D MOFs as highly sensitive, selective, and reversible sensing materials for the low&#8208;power detection of highly toxic gases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Piezoelectric Covalent Triazine&#8208;based Nanotube for Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Water and Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non&#8208;piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine&#8208;based nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) as a novel piezoelectric material. The CTN&#8208;1 comprises of high surface area, nitrogen&#8208;rich and fully conjugated structure, which provides a series of merits for piezoelectric catalytic processes. These structural features combined with one&#8208;dimensional tubular morphology endow CTN&#8208;1 with excellent mechanical stimuli response and thus displaying prominent piezoelectric properties via pronounced nanocurvature effect. We further show that the CTN&#8208;1 enables the efficient synthesis of H2O2 from water in the air via mechanical energy conversion, with an excellent piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 4115 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which exceeds all other reported piezoelectric materials. The piezocatalysis by the CTN&#8208;1 can be practically integrated into a self&#8208;Fenton system, which exhibits excellent pollutant degradation capability. This work demonstrates the enormous potential of a new type of piezoelectric synthetic nanotube from organic frameworks for the in&#8208;situ synthesis valuable chemicals.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non-piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom-up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine-based nanotube (CTN-1) as a novel piezoelectric material. The CTN-1 comprises of high surface area, nitrogen-rich and fully conjugated structure, which provides a series of merits for piezoelectric catalytic processes. These structural features combined with one-dimensional tubular morphology endow CTN-1 with excellent mechanical stimuli response and thus displaying prominent piezoelectric properties via pronounced nanocurvature effect. We further show that the CTN-1 enables the efficient synthesis of H2O2 from water in the air via mechanical energy conversion, with an excellent piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 4115 &#956;mol g-1 h-1, which exceeds all other reported piezoelectric materials. The piezocatalysis by the CTN-1 can be practically integrated into a self-Fenton system, which exhibits excellent pollutant degradation capability. This work demonstrates the enormous potential of a new type of piezoelectric synthetic nanotube from organic frameworks for the in-situ synthesis valuable chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;site Portable Lithium Detection in Mining and Recycling Industries based on a DNAzyme Fluorescent Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global demand for lithium has soared in recent years due to the wide use of lithium batteries. To meet this demand, we herein report developing novel on&#8208;site sample preparation methods for the extraction of Li+ from relevant materials, including brine water, spodumene rock, and lithium&#8208;ion battery electrodes, and a DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent sensor for sensitive and robust detection of Li+ in these samples down to 1.4 mM (10 ppm) using a portable fluorometer. The system can distinguish key threshold lithium levels that indicate economic value across several industries, including 200 ppm Li+ for brine mining, 6% Li2O or SC6 for rock mining, and Li+&#8208;specific aging in LIBs. The methods developed and demonstrated in this work will allow highly selective, on&#8208;site, portable detection of lithium in both environmental samples to identify new lithium resources and in battery electrodes to guide recycling strategies in order to meet the global demand for lithium.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Tuning Metallic Sites in Molecular Complexes for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic hybrid catalysts with highly tunable single&#8208;sites are promising for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER), but molecular&#8208;scale understanding of underlying reaction mechanisms still remain elusive on these bulk materials. Herein, we report a direct construction of heterogenized molecular complexes stabilized on carbon substrates via coordinating Fe&#8208;Ni sites with four aromatic carboxylate ligands (FeNi&#8208;Lx). The ligands&#8208;tuning &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction between aromatic carboxylate ligands and carbon supports promote the oxidative charge accumulation on Fe&#8208;Ni sites via fast electron transferring, thus the optimized FeNi&#8208;Lx rendering a mass activity of 6680 A gFe/Ni&#8208;1 at 0.3 V overpotential. In situ characteristics and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the OH&#8208; nucleophilic attack on hypervalent iron sites induce the reconstruction of active Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni species, accompanying with fast valence increasing. Whereas, during OER, the unexpected valence reduction of Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Ni sites would be attributed to the oxygen&#8208;generating from OOH* intermediates. These findings would establish an essential understanding of the origin of active centers in molecular complexes catalysts for oxygen&#8208;evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox Electrocatalyst for Durable Oxygen Evolution in Acid Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, direct electrolysis of seawater for green hydrogen production is primarily focused on neutral and alkaline systems. However, the precipitation of calcium and magnesium ions restricts the advancement of this technology. An acidic system can effectively address this issue. Given that Ru/Ir&#8208;based catalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity also exhibit high chlorine evolution reaction (CER) activity, acid seawater splitting requires anodes with higher selectivity and stability compared to the other two systems. In this study, we propose a non&#8208;precious Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox as the active anode for direct acid seawater electrolysis, which exhibits a high OER selectivity and remarkable stability for more than 1200 hours. Different from the Cl&#8208;&#8208;free system, *Cl occupied on Ru sites could shift the OER active center to Mn on Ru0.1Mn0.9Ox, which prevents the lattice oxygen consumed on Ru and hinders the metal site dissolution. As the CER&#8208;insensitive catalytic center, Mn activated by the introduction of Ru can adsorb a substantial amount of *OH, creating an OER&#8208;favored local environment that inhibits CER. We introduce Cl&#8208;&#8208;assisted transfer of OER active sites to CER&#8208;insensitive Mn as a fundamental strategy for achieving highly selective and durable oxygen evolution in acidic seawater.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl phosphonates are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet their efficient synthesis by direct C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization remains a challenge. Here, we report straightforward access to benzylic phosphonates by direct C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization in a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling reaction between non&#8208;specialized alkylarenes and unfunctionalized phosphites. Notably, the C&#8211;H substrates are used as the limiting reagents. The scope of benzylic C&#8211;H substrates is broad, and the mild reaction conditions allow for good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway rather than the cationic pathway followed for specialized benzylic C&#8211;H substrates in previous methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;springe Enriched Hierarchical Porous MOP/COF Hybrid Aerogel: Efficient Recovery of Gold from Electronic Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extraction of gold from secondary resources such as electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) has become crucial in recent times to compensate for the gradual scarcity of the noble metal in natural mines. However, designing and synthesizing a suitable material for highly efficient gold recovery is still a great challenge. Herein, we have strategically designed rapid fabrication of an ionic crystalline hybrid aerogel by covalent threading of an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic polyhedra with an imine&#8208;linked chemically stable covalent organic framework at ambient condition. The hierarchically porous ultra&#8208;light aerogel featuring imine&#8208;rich backbone, high surface area, and cationic sites have shown fast removal, high uptake capacity (2349 mg/g), and excellent selectivity towards gold sequestration. Besides, the aerogel can extract ultra&#8208;trace gold&#8208;ions from different terrestrial water bodies, aiming towards safe drinking water. This study demonstrates the great potential of the composite materials based on a novel approach to designing a hybrid porous material for efficient gold recovery from complex water matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;adaptive Coordination Evolution Mediated Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partition in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controllable and precise structural regulation of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on isoreticular chemistry is an effective strategy for creating functional material platforms, such as efficient porous adsorbents. Herein, for the first time, mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on pseudo&#8208;D2h&#8208;symmetric [M4(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(COO)6] (M = Mn/Fe) clusters, two pore space partitioned MOFs (CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe, CTGU = China Three Gorges University) have been successfully constructed. Owing to the more confined adsorption space and dense binding sites produced by pore space partitioning (PSP), the CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe exhibit significantly enhanced performance in the capture or recovery SF6 (greenhouse/electronic specialty gas) &#160;from &#160;SF6/N2 mixture compared to their non&#8208;partitioned homologous structures (CTGU&#8208;46&#8208;Mn/Fe) with adsorption selectivity increased from 37/72 to 634/157 (v/v, 10/90, 100 kPa). The theoretical calculations also elucidated that the implementation of PSP within CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe leads to dramatically strengthened binding affinity for SF6 over N2 through extra multiple F&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions. This study represents a valuable advance in crystal engineering field: the SACE of polynuclear metal clusters is expected to be useful in the structural regulation of MOFs and the fabrication of advanced porous adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#9472;O Radical Coupling in Ultrathin Reconstructed Co6.8Se8 Nanosheets for Effective Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing ultrathin transition metal electrocatalysts with optimal surface chemistry state is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished. Herein, we synthesize ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets (NSs) with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium (Se) into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). The prepared ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA/cm2, outperforming the mostly reported Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Advanced operando synchrotron spectroscopies and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs, whose surface is reconstructed into Se&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 during the OER process, could trigger direct O*&#8208;O* radical coupling rather than OOH* intermediates within AEM pathway thus lowering the energy input. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Co6.8Se8 NSs with shorter Co&#8208;Co bond length and stable Co&#8208;Se bond could optimize the rate&#8208;determining step barrier via OPM pathway. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit excellent stability for more than 500 h of continuous charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 4 mA/cm2. The present study highlights the structural&#8208;dependent switch of OER pathways and provides valuable insights for further development of ultrathin OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bent Perylenediimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of &#960;&#8208;functional materials are predominantly influenced by both their molecular structures and interactions between &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent advancements have focused on modifying the geometry or topology of &#960;&#8208;molecules from planar to nonplanar conformations to tailor molecular properties. However, the interactions among nonplanar &#960;&#8208;molecules remain largely unexplored, likely due to the significant reduction in contact surfaces arising from their curved structures. Herein, we investigated the electro&#8208;optical properties and &#960;&#8208;stacking behaviors of a series of bent perylenediimides (B&#8208;PDIs) with gradual changes in bending angles, achieved by altering the lengths of linear alkyl chains connecting the two nitrogen positions of each PDI. Curvature&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly of these bent PDIs is observed, which is primarily driven by dipole&#8208;dipole interactions rather than dispersion forces. More importantly, fine&#8208;tuning intermolecular coupling through bending enables excited&#8208;state symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in [n]B&#8208;PDIs (n = 16, 12) in the crystalline solid state.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high Li&#8208;ion transference numbers and fast ionic conductivity are urgently needed for technological innovations in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. To promote the dissociation of ion pairs and overcome the mechanical brittleness and interface defects caused by traditional fillers in polymeric electrolytes, we designed and fabricated a cationic hypercrosslinking metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (HCMOPs) polymer as SSE. Benefiting a three&#8208;component synergistic effect: cationic MOPs, branched polyethyleneimine macromonomer and polyelectrolyte units, the Li&#8208;HCMOP electrolyte possesses a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity, a high Li&#8208;ion transference number and a low activation energy. Their LiFePO4/Li batteries exhibit high capacity with superior rate performance and cycling stability. Moreover, soluble MOPs serve as high crosslinking nodes to provide excellent mechanical strength for electrolytes and good compatibility with polymers.

         <title>Idealizing Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Film Competitive by Surface Lattice Etching&#8208;Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells are desirable for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing application in the future, yet the presence of moisture and oxygen goes against perovskite crystallization and deteriorates phase stabilization, leading to the formation of substantial defective nano&#8208;impurities, especially on the vulnerable surface. Here, we propose a strategy to simultaneously remove superficial defect layer and solidify the surface by soaking air&#8208;fabricated perovskite film into low&#8208;polar organic esters at elevated temperature to trigger an in&#8208;situ dynamic surface lattice disassemble and reconstruction process. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results indicate that the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is first dissolved and then the Br&#8208;rich phase is recrystallized at solid&#8208;liquid interface owing to the balance between weak solubility and high&#8208;temperature induced annealing process, thus hardening the soft surface and releasing the lattice tensile stress, which benefits the minimization of interfacial recombination and improvement of the structural stability. As a result, we prepare a carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br device in complete air without precise control on humidity, achieving a champion efficiency of 15.37% with excellent resistance to harsh attackers. This method offers a promising avenue for overcoming the limit of processing conditions on advancing perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte incorporating 1,3&#8208;propanesultone additive has been developed to form a highly ion&#8208;conductive and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This innovation significantly enhances the performance and stability of lithium metal batteries in wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000&#8197;h at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000&#8197;cycles, retention: 67&#8201;%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;A bifunctional electrolyte incorporating 1,3-propanesultone additive has been developed to form a highly ion-conductive and robust cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). This innovation significantly enhances the performance and stability of lithium metal batteries in wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate-based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high-capacity nickel-rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3-propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode-electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000&#8197;h at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and LiCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes (1000&#8197;cycles, retention: 67&#8201;%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

This first report of using chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) as enantioselective carriers in bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) shows that CCOFs enhance the efficiency and enantioselectivity of amino acid separation. Exfoliating CCOFs into nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible sites, enabling the separation of chiral drug enantiomers unattainable with the pristine CCOFs.







Abstract
Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.

         <title>Internal Electron&#8208;Donation Allocation Design for Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules is enhanced by the introduction of electron donors, which makes it easier to coordinate with Li+. This greatly weakens the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in the ester&#8208;based electrolyte to more than 0.5&#8197;M. The Li|| LiFePO4 batteries with such electrolyte exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have become a hot topic in the research of next&#8208;generation advanced battery technology due to their high specific energy. However, the high reaction activity between lithium metal and electrolyte is considered one of the key bottlenecks limiting large&#8208;scale applications of LMBs. As a classic electrolyte additive, lithium nitrate (LiNO3) significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, its solubility in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes widely used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is extremely low, causing limited protective capability on lithium metal, which has become a key obstacle to the commercial application of lithium metal batteries. Here, we enhanced the local negative charge density of carbonyl oxygen atoms in carbonate molecules by introducing electron donors, making it easier for them to coordinate with Li+, thereby weakening the interaction between Li+ and NO3&#8722;, and significantly increasing the solubility of LiNO3 in ester electrolytes. The modified ester solvent promotes the derivatization and decomposition of salt anions, leading to the formation of a dense SEI layer rich in LiF and LiNxOy. This significantly improves the stability of lithium metal in ester&#8208;based electrolytes. The assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows excellent cycling performance of over 4000&#8197;hours.

         <title>Structures of a DNA Polymerase Caught while Incorporating Responsive Dual&#8208;Functional Nucleotide Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environment&#8208;sensitive C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified nucleotide probes serve as excellent substrates for Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq). The probes provided unprecedent insight into the chemical&#8208;space tolerance and incorporation mechanism of the enzyme in real&#8208;time by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy, and at the atomic level by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Functionalizing nucleic acids using DNA polymerases is essential in biophysical and biotechnology applications. This study focuses on understanding how DNA polymerases recognize and incorporate nucleotides with diverse chemical modifications, aiming to develop advanced nucleotide probes. We present the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq) with C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified environment&#8208;sensitive 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (dUTP) probes. These nucleotides include SedUTP, BFdUTP and FBFdUTP, which bear selenophene, benzofuran and fluorobenzofuran, respectively, at the C5 position of uracil, and exhibit high conformational sensitivity. SedUTP and FBFdUTP serve as dual&#8208;app probes, combining a fluorophore with X&#8208;ray anomalous scattering Se or 19F NMR labels. Our study reveals that the size of the heterocycle influences how DNA polymerase families A and B incorporate these modified nucleotides during single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension reactions. Remarkably, the responsiveness of FBFdUTP enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the binary complex formation and polymerase activity through fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy. Comparative analysis of incorporation profiles, fluorescence, 19F NMR data, and crystal structures of ternary complexes highlights the plasticity of the enzyme. Key insight is provided into the role of gatekeeper amino acids (Arg660 and Arg587) in accommodating and processing these modified substrates, offering a structural basis for next&#8208;generation nucleotide probe development.

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Indolyl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indolyl sulfoxonium ylides are presented as a new type of monoaryl axially chiral framework. To access this intriguing scaffold, a chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed enantioselective iodoaminocyclization reaction of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides was developed. The optically enriched atropoisomers can be transformed into diverse chiral structures.







Abstract
Despite recent advancements in the catalytic generation of axial chirality, reports on non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers remain limited because of the stringent steric requirements necessary to establish effective rotational brakes. Herein, we present a novel class of monoaryl atropisomers, indolyl ketosulfoxonium ylides, and describe an organocatalytic protocol for their synthesis. We discovered that a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) serves as an effective catalyst for the highly enantioselective iodination of ortho&#8208;aminophenylethynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a strong preference for the intended iodination process over the competing protonation was observed. Subsequently, intramolecular amide cyclization enabled the formation of sterically congested indole fragments. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the products was demonstrated by showcasing versatile transformations into other chiral scaffolds with complete retention of optical purity.

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;encapsulated enzymes are promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, ultrasensitive activity analysis of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). We demonstrate that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated, which exhibits high accuracy for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.







Abstract
Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we demonstrate a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n=63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80&#8201;% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92&#8201;%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Reactivity of Nitrones with Amino Acids and Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrones are used as masked precursors that can be photoisomerized to oxaziridine bioconjugation reagents in situ or separately. This approach provides access to previously unexplored N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines, which modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan and in a proteomic context tyrosine residues, thus expanding the chemical toolset for protein conjugation and proteomic profiling.







Abstract
Controlled modifications of amino acids are an indispensable tool for advancing fundamental and translational research based on peptides and proteins. Yet, we still lack methods to chemically modify each naturally occurring amino acid sidechain. To help address this gap, we show that N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridines expand the scope of bioconjugation methods to chemically modify cysteine, methionine, and tryptophan residues with evidence for additional tyrosine labelling in a proteomic context. Conjugation primarily at tryptophan sites can be accessed by selective cleavage of modifications at other sidechains. The N,&#945;&#8208;diaryl oxaziridine reagents are accessed through photoisomerization of nitrones, which serve as photocaged reagents, thus providing an additional level of control over reactivity. Initial guiding principles for the design of nitrone reagents are developed by exploring the impact of structure on UV/Vis absorption, photoisomerization, and reactivity. We identify a nitrone structure that maximizes photoisomerization efficiency, the aqueous stability of the oxaziridine, the extent of amino acid modification, and the stability of the resulting amino acid conjugates. We then translate nitrone reagents to modify proteins in aqueous conditions. Finally, we use nitrones to profile reactive residues across the proteome of a mammalian cell line and find that they expand the proteome coverage.

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the surface energy state of the SnO2 buried interface was modulated by proton precompensation treatment, which can inhibit the proton transfer behavior guided by proton affinity and enhance the stability of perovskite crystal, achieving efficient perovskite solar cells with significantly improved photothermal stability.







Abstract
The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90&#8201;% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000&#8197;h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55&#8201;% than the control devices (23.03&#8201;%).

         <title>Modulating Core Polarity in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of intermolecular polarity in metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the selectivity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction is highlighted in this study. By rationally modulating the core&#8216;s polarity of pyridine&#8208;containing imine&#8208;like COFs, we achieved 93.1&#8201;% selectivity and 90.5&#8201;% faradic efficiency for H2O2 production. This study paved the way for designing efficient and selective electrochemical H2O2 production catalysts.







Abstract
Tuning the charge density at the active site to balance the adsorption ability and reactivity of oxygen is extremely significant for driving a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we have highlighted the influence of intermolecular polarity in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical H2O2 production. Different C3 symmetric building blocks have been utilized to regulate the charge density at the active sites. The benzene&#8208;cored COF, which exhibits reduced polarity than the triazine&#8208;cored COF, displayed enhanced performance in H2O2 production, achieving 93.1&#8201;% selectivity for H2O2 at 0.4&#8197;V with almost two&#8208;electron transfer and a faradaic efficiency of 90.5&#8201;%. In&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were employed to confirm H2O2 generation and analyze spatial reactivity patterns. These techniques provided detailed insights into localized catalytic behavior, emphasizing the influence of core polarity.

         <title>Multifunctional, Fluorene&#8208;Based Modulator of Cholinergic and GABAergic Neurotransmission as a Novel Drug Candidate for Palliative Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patients with Alzheimer's disease need immediate help. In this work, we present a new approach to treating cognitive deficits alongside the psychological symptoms of dementia. Through a combination of biological screening, crystallography, and computational methods, we have developed an innovative drug candidate &#8211; a dual modulator of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Comprehensive in vivo evaluation demonstrates its strong potential for a breakthrough.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Given that cholinergic neurons are predominantly affected in AD, current treatments primarily aim to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. However, imbalances in other neurotransmitters, such as &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA), also contribute to AD symptomatology. In the presented research, using a combination of crystallography and computational methods we developed compound 6 as a dual modulator of GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems. Compound 6 demonstrated inhibition of BuChE (IC50=0.21&#8197;&#956;M) and GABA transporter 1 (IC50=10.96&#8197;&#956;M) and 3 (IC50=7.76&#8197;&#956;M), along with a favorable drug&#8208;likeness profile. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed the effectiveness of 6 in enhancing memory retention and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in animal models, while also proving safe and bioavailable for oral administration. The innovative multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligand 6 offers a new approach to treating cognitive deficits and BPSD in AD.

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions Via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for modulating mechanophore reactivity is introduced by employing a cyclic pulling geometry to precisely tailor force transmission. This approach enables the construction of polymer materials with hierarchical mechanochemical responsiveness, advancing the field of polymer mechanochemistry.







Abstract
In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160&#8197;min&#8722;1 to 0.00133&#8197;min&#8722;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis indicates that the split force transmission along ring chains contributes to the significant difference in mechanochemical reactivity. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.

&lt;p&gt;In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer-based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene-maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.00133&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, achieving up to a 12-fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis indicates that the split force transmission along ring chains contributes to the significant difference in mechanochemical reactivity. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Fused Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through Lewis Acid Catalyzed Highly Selective C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange Reaction between Bicyclobutanes and Diaziridines</title>

         <dc:description>
Described is a selective &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines. A chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was also developed to promote an enantioselective version of this reaction.







Abstract
The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98&#8201;% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee).

         <title>Non&#8208;selective Defect Minimization towards Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared a regulated ZIF membrane with reduced defect density owing to the confined growth of crystals between the top layer and substrate. Such a membrane provides a superior H2/N2 separation selectivity.







Abstract
The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99&#8201;% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353&#8201;% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.

         <title>Crafting Molecular Tools for 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 in a Single Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule modulators are essential for probing protein function, but their development is often limited by complex synthesis. We introduce a simple, one&#8208;step method to create multifunctional modulators. We developed a library for human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1, including probes, sensors, photocrosslinkers, and inhibitors. Our technology shows promise for complex biological applications, demonstrated by successful protein inhibition and labeling in vitro, in cellulo, and in vivo.







Abstract
Small molecule modulators are powerful tools for selectively probing and manipulating proteins in native biological systems. However, the development of versatile modulators that exhibit desired properties is hindered by the lack of a rapid and robust synthetic strategy. Here, we develop a facile and reliable one&#8208;step methodology for the generation of multifunctional toolboxes encompassing a wide variety of chemical modulators with different desired features. These modulators bind irreversibly to the protein target via a selective warhead. Key elements are introduced onto the warhead in a single step using multi&#8208;component reactions. To illustrate the power of this new technology, we synthesized a library of diverse modulators designed to explore a highly challenging and poorly understood protein, human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1. Modulators made include; activity&#8208;based/photoaffinity probes, chemosensors, photocrosslinkers, as well as light&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;affinity inhibitors. The efficacy of our compounds was successfully established through the provision of on demand inhibition and labeling of our target protein in vitro, in cellulo and in vivo; thus, proving that this technology has promising potential for applications in many complex biological systems.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Hybridized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, C60&#8208;Y, featuring a high dielectric constant and isotropic molecular packing, has been synthesized. The fullerene hybrid enhances exciton dissociation, reduces energy losses, and improves charge mobility. When incorporated into a ternary blend system, it achieved an impressive PCE of 19.22&#8201;%, outperforming other reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component.







Abstract
A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8722;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02&#8201;%, surpassing the 13.31&#8201;% achieved with Me&#8722;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22&#8201;% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.

We report a hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane to reconstruct hydrogen&#8208;bond network, solvation structure and contribute to excellent temperature adaptability. The hydrogen bond network in free water is significantly weakened, while that between sulfolane and water is highly strengthened. The zinc&#8208;ion capacitor shows remarkable cycling stability over 55000 cycles and excellent temperature adaptability from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4&#8197;V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8&#8201;% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7&#8201;% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.

&lt;p&gt;We report a hydrogen bond-anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane to reconstruct hydrogen-bond network, solvation structure and contribute to excellent temperature adaptability. The hydrogen bond network in free water is significantly weakened, while that between sulfolane and water is highly strengthened. The zinc-ion capacitor shows remarkable cycling stability over 55000 cycles and excellent temperature adaptability from &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Cucurbalsaminones B and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biosynthesis of cucurbalsaminones, we accomplished the first synthesis of cucurbalsaminones B and C in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to adjust the oxidation state of the sterically hindered C11 position.







Abstract
Cucurbalsaminones B (1) and C (2) are two abeo&#8208;cucurbitane triterpenoids with a unique 5/6/3/6/5&#8208;fused ring system and exhibit potent multidrug resistance (MDR)&#8208;reversing activity. Herein, we report the first synthesis of these two natural products, both of them were accomplished in 14 steps from commercially available inexpensive resource compound lanosterol. Key features of this synthesis include a biomimetic tandem Wagner&#8211;Meerwein type lanostane&#8208;to&#8208;cucurbitane rearrangement followed by a bioinspired photochemical oxa&#8208;di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane (ODPM) rearrangement to complete the skeleton construction and an Eosin Y photoinduced Barton&#8208;McCombie deoxygenation to realize the challenging oxidation state adjustment of the sterically hindered C11 position.

         <title>Optimizing Propylene/Propane Sieving Separation through Gate&#8208;Pressure Control within a Flexible Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) can achieve dynamic structural changes from closed to open under the stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibits adaptive adsorption for C3H6 and C3H8, and exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent gate opening phenomenon, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures.







Abstract
The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra (4&#8208;cyanophenyl) tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N

&#8943;

H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.

         <title>Paired Electro&#8208;Synthesis of Remote Amino Alcohols with/in H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a groundbreaking electrochemical ring&#8208;opening protocol for the direct synthesis of remote amino alcohols via copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential paired electrolysis under mild, biocompatible conditions. This method enables rapid access to a wide variety of remote amino alcohols with diverse functional groups, utilizing an electro&#8208;redox ring&#8208;opening approach for efficient peptide alcohol modification and assembly. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations confirm that water serves as both the solvent and hydrogen source, generating CuH to reduce aldehydes to alcohols.







Abstract
Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are three ring fusion patterns from one chemical reaction. Carbocyclic heptannulation provides access to brightly fluorescent, chiral perylene diimides, which can be converted into highly electrophilic tropylium cations and functionalized by direct aromatic substitution reactions.







Abstract
The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity increase mechanism in rechargeable magnesium batteries featuring Cu metal is investigated through multiscale joint operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray characterizations. These analyses unveil that the capacity enhancement stems from the progressive electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu. This corrosion initiates irreversible depletion of both the Cu current collector and magnesium metal, ultimately resulting in cell failure.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature. Here, enantiomeric nanotadpole aggregates from helical poly(phenylacetylene)s formed 1D chains with favored head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and homochiral connections, stemmed from size difference in heads and tails and chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase, respectively, which deepens the understanding of hierarchical homochirality.







Abstract
Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.

         <title>Biomimetic Elastic Single&#8208;Atom Protrusions Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion, featuring symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo sites for strong coupling and activation of nitrogen (N2), and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure that dynamically adapts to rapidly changing intermediates, lowering formation energy barriers. Together, these features enable exceptional N2 fixation activity. This bioinspired approach paves the way for designing efficient catalysts for complex multistep reactions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising route for sustainable ammonia (NH3) generation, but the eNRR efficiency is dramatically impeded by sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, inspired by the dynamic extension&#8208;contraction of sea anemone tentacles in response to environmental changes, we propose a biomimetic elastic Mo single&#8208;atom protrusion on vanadium oxide support (pSA Mo/VOH) electrocatalyst featuring a symmetry&#8208;breaking Mo site and an elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramid for efficient eNRR. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the protruding Mo&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;breaking structure optimizes the d&#8208;electron filling of Mo, enhancing the back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* antibonding orbital, effectively polarizing the N&#8801;N bond and reducing the barrier from *N2 to *N2H. Notably, the elastic Mo&#8722;O4 pyramidal structure of pSA Mo provides a dynamic Mo&#8722;O microenvironment during continuous eNRR processes. This optimizes the electronic structure of the Mo sites based on different reaction intermediates, enhancing the adsorption of various N intermediates and maintaining low barriers throughout the six&#8208;step hydrogenation process. Consequently, the elastic pSA Mo/VOH exhibits an excellent NH3 yield rate of 50.71&#177;1.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 35.38&#177;1.03&#8201;%, outperforming most electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. In their Research Article (e202412591), Chao Gu, Yaping Du et&#8197;al. define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d transition metal&#8211;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new C(sp3)&#8722;H acetylation methodology for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;substituted ketones that enables the construction of quaternary C centers via copper catalysis. A t&#8208;butoxy radical derived from tBuOOtBu engages in H&#8208;atom abstraction of an C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in substrates R&#8722;H to generate radicals R&#8226; captured by copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ph) formed through acid&#8208;base exchange between [CuII]&#8722;OtBu intermediates and ketones CH3C(O)Ar to give &#945;&#8208;functionalized ketones R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;substituted ketones are important chemical targets as synthetic intermediates as well as functionalities in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report the &#945;&#8208;acetylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates R&#8722;H with arylmethyl ketones ArC(O)Me to provide &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones ArC(O)CH2R at RT with tBuOOtBu as oxidant via copper(I)

&#8208;diketiminato catalysts. Proceeding via alkyl radicals R&#8226;, this method enables &#945;&#8208;substitution with bulky substituents without competing elimination that occurs in more traditional alkylation reactions between enolates and alkyl electrophiles. DFT studies suggest the intermediacy of copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ar) that capture alkyl radicals R&#8226; to give R&#8722;CH2C(O)Ar outcompeting dimerization of the copper(II) enolate to give the 1,4&#8208;diketone ArC(O)CH2CH2C(O)Ar.

         <title>Polysilaketals: High&#8208;Performance Polyether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Tunable Disubstituted Silane Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating silyl groups into the backbone of polyethylene oxide (PEO), the leading polymer electrolyte, via the novel anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals yielded a series of polysilaketals [P(OSiR&#8217;,R&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;2EO)] with varying steric bulk. They display competitive electrochemical properties, including the first example of a solid polymer electrolyte with higher conductivity than PEO. Moreover, unlike PEO, the amorphous nature of these polymers facilitates low temperature applications.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes exhibit higher energy density and improved safety in lithium&#8208;ion batteries relative to traditionally used liquid electrolytes but are currently limited by their lower electrochemical performance. Aiming to access polymer electrolytes with competitive electrochemical properties, we developed the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (AROP) of cyclic silaketals to synthesize amorphous silicon&#8208;containing polyether&#8208;based electrolytes with varying substituent bulk of the general formula [OSi(R)2(CH2CH2O)2]n (R=alkyl, phenyl). As opposed to previously reported uncontrolled polycondensation routes toward low molecular weight polysilaketals, AROP allows access to targeted molecular weights above the entanglement threshold of the polymers. The polysilaketal with the lowest steric bulk (P(OSiMe,Me&#8208;2EO)) exceeds the conductivity of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a leading polymer electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solid polymer electrolyte to achieve this benchmark. Steric bulk in polysilaketals was found to impart stability and two bulkier polysilaketals, P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) and P(OSiMe,Ph&#8208;2EO), exhibited higher current fractions than PEO over a wide range of salt loadings. Moreover, the efficacy of P(OSiEt,Et&#8208;2EO) was competitive with that of PEO. Taken together, the tunable and competitive electrochemical properties of polysilaketals validate the systematic incorporation of silyl groups as a strategy to access high performance polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene was selectively converted into a valuable gasoline component, achieving yields of up to 73.3&#8201;% with a 90.1&#8201;% proportion of branched alkanes over SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 at 280&#8201;&#176;C. The synergistic coupling between sulfate groups and Lewis acid sites (Zr sites) enhances polyethylene activation, while weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites regulate the reaction pathway to favor branched alkane production.heterogeneous catalysisbranched alkanesplastic upcyclingpolyethyleneacid sites







Abstract
Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8211;C13) with yield of 73.3&#8201;% over SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280&#8201;&#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1&#8201;% within the C4&#8211;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.

         <title>Biosynthetic Origin of the Methoxy Group in Quinine and Related Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two substrates, tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine, are used in parallel by Cinchona to generate the naturally occurring mixtures of methoxy and non&#8208;methoxy Cinchona alkaloids. Discovery of the genes responsible for methoxylation allows reconstitution of biosynthetic intermediates in tobacco.







Abstract
Quinine is a historically important natural product containing a methoxy group that has been assumed to be incorporated at a late pathway stage. Here we show that the methoxy group in quinine and related alkaloids is introduced onto the starting substrate tryptamine. Feeding studies definitively show that 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine is utilized as a quinine biosynthetic intermediate in planta. We discover the biosynthetic genes that encode the responsible oxidase and methyltransferase, and we use these genes to reconstitute the early steps of the alkaloid biosynthetic pathway in Nicotiana benthamiana to produce a mixture of methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloid intermediates. Importantly, we show that the co&#8208;occurrence of both tryptamine and 5&#8208;methoxytryptamine substrates, along with the substrate promiscuity of downstream pathway enzymes, enable parallel formation of both methoxylated and non&#8208;methoxylated alkaloids.

         <title>Twisted&#8208;Planar Molecular Engineering with Sonication&#8208;Induced J&#8208;Aggregation To Design Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregates for Enhanced Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted&#8208;planar molecular design together with a sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation strategy has been used to develop MTSIC J&#8208;aggregates, with the absorption red&#8208;shifting from 620&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. MTSIC undergoes kinetic assembly from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and eventually to stable J&#8208;aggregates. MTSIC J&#8208;dots showed enhanced fluorescence as well as photodynamic and photothermal effects for cancer phototherapy.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates show great promise in phototherapy, but are limited to specific molecular skeletons and poor molecular self&#8208;assembly controllability. Herein, we report a twisted&#8208;planar molecular strategy with sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation to develop donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type J&#8208;aggregates for phototherapy. With propeller aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) moieties as the twisted subunits and thiophene as the planar &#960;&#8208;bridge, the optimal twisted&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;interaction in MTSIC induces appropriate slip angle and J&#8208;aggregates formation, redshifting the absorption from 624&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. In contrast, shorter &#960;&#8208;planarity results in amorphous aggregates, and elongation promotes charge transfer (CT) coupled J&#8208;aggregates. Sonication was demonstrated to be effective in controlling self&#8208;assembly behaviors of MTSIC, which enables the transformation from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and finally to stable J&#8208;aggregates. After encapsulation with lipid&#8208;PEG, the resultant J&#8208;dots show enhanced phototherapeutic effects over amorphous dots, including brightness, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and photothermal conversion, delivering superior cancer phototherapy performance. This work not only advances D&#8211;A type J&#8208;aggregates design but also provides a promising strategy for supramolecular assembly development.

         <title>Iodine Boosted Fluoro&#8208;Organic Borate Electrolytes Enabling Fluent Ion&#8208;Conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative electrolyte formulation for rechargeable magnesium batteries, addressing the challenges of complex synthesis and magnesium anode passivation seen in traditional boron&#8208;based salts. By combining tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), the system evolves into Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 upon contact with the Mg anode. This results in a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, enhancing Mg plating and stripping efficiency. Our proposed synthetic reaction and in situ formation of SEI later also has universality for other B(OR)3, where R represents different F substitution.

Rechargeable magnesium batteries are regarded as a promising multi&#8208;valent battery system for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage applications. Boron&#8208;based organic magnesium salts with terminal substituent fluorinated anions (Mg[B(ORF)4]2, RF=fluorinated alkyl) have exhibited impressive electrochemical stability and oxidative stability. Nevertheless, their deployment is hindered by the complicated synthesis routes and the surface passivation of Mg metal anode. Herein, we report the design of an advanced electrolyte formulation comprised of tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)3) and iodine (I2) in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent, which eventually convert into a Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte system upon interacting with Mg anode. The Mg anode reacts with I2 and the electron&#8208;accepting B(HFIP)3, leading to the in situ formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer composed of MgF2 and MgI2 species that can facilitate fast and stable Mg plating/stripping. Compared with the pristine Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME electrolyte, the Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte exhibited superior electrochemical performance including an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (~80&#8197;mV), high Coulombic efficiency and a long&#8208;cycling period over 1500&#8197;h. In result, the rechargeable magnesium batteries with Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte and Chevrel&#8208;phase Mo6S8 cathode show outstanding compatibility, rapid kinetics, and stable cyclability for over 1200 cycles, surpassing all previously reported boron&#8208;based electrolytes. This work introduces a promising halogen&#8208;enhancement strategy for boron&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolytes, with the overarching goal of establishing favorable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases that are pivotal for the advancement and optimization of multi&#8208;valent secondary batteries.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents an innovative electrolyte formulation for rechargeable magnesium batteries, addressing the challenges of complex synthesis and magnesium anode passivation seen in traditional boron-based salts. By combining tri(hexafluoroisopropyl) borate (B(HFIP)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), the system evolves into Mg[B(HFIP)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/DME-MgI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon contact with the Mg anode. This results in a solid-electrolyte interphase, enhancing Mg plating and stripping efficiency. Our proposed synthetic reaction and in situ formation of SEI later also has universality for other B(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where R represents different F substitution. This formulation exhibits superior electrochemical performance, low overpotential, and long cycling life, outperforming previous boron-based electrolytes.

         <title>An Interstitial Boron Inserted Metastable Hexagonal Rh Nanocrystal for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing metastable phase structure plays an important role in changing the physicochemical properties and improving the catalytic performance of nanocrystals. Unfortunately, the synthesis of metastable phase metallic nanocrystals is highly challenging, mainly due to the thermodynamically unstable ground&#8208;state. Here, we report a synthesis of unconventional metastable hexagonal rhodium nanocrystal (Bint&#8208;Rhhcp/C) via interstitial boron insertion. The insertion of boron atoms into the interstitial sites of cubic Rh lattice not only induces the atomic arrangements from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), but also stabilizes the metastable hexagonal Rh structure. Benefiting from the phase transition and interstitial boron doping, the Bint&#8208;Rhhcp/C catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.413 mA &#956;gPGM&#8208;1. Experimental measurements including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strengthened adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface of Bint&#8208;Rhhcp/C is responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and increased water proportions in the gap region in the electric double layers. As a result, the increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network facilitate high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen transfer across the interface, thereby boost the alkaline HOR performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:

Lost in post&#8208;translation. Cordycicadins A&#8211;D are four C20&#160;polyketides, all containing a&#160;g&#8208;lactone&#160;fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unknown. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B. The targets were convergently assembled, in a biomimetic fashion,&#160;via&#160;an efficient ketene trapping&#8208;intramolecular Michael addition sequence that delivered the requisite 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;fused framework with high diastereoselectivity, enabled by the synthesis of complex dioxenones that serve as&#160;in situ&#160;ketene precursors. Recognition of the embedded polyketide symmetry enabled the use of a divergent&#8208;convergent synthetic&#160;strategy, based on the use of two products from an early&#8208;stage enzymatic resolution. The synthetic routes afforded (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D in 14 steps and 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B in 13 steps (longest linear sequence). This work confirms the structure of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the observed instability of the anticipated natural product 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadin B during purification may explain why it is yet to be isolated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from AIEgen&#8208;functionalized chiral [2]rotaxane building block, we have successfully synthesized a new class of chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers through controllable divergent strategy for the first time, based on which novel chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHSs) were successfully constructed in aqueous phase by sequentially introducing achiral donor and acceptor. More importantly, accompanied by&#160;the two&#8208;step F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the resultant artificial LHSs, the sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances were achieved, highlighting that the chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers could serve as excellent relay for both energy transfer and chirality transmission. Impressively, compared with the sole chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values of the resultant artificial LHSs were amplified by one order of magnitude up to 0.038, enabling their further applications in information storage and encryption. The proof&#8208;of concept study provides not only a feasible approach for the efficient amplification of CPL performances but also a novel platform for the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Pioneering  Built&#8208;in Interfacial Electric Field for Enhanced Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we develop a nano&#8208;heterostructure composed of ultra&#8208;thin W5N4 shells over Ni3N nanoparticles (Ni3N@W5N4) as efficient catalysts, in which built&#8208;in interfacial electric field (BIEF) is created owing to the distinct lattice arrangements and work functions of biphasic metal nitrides. The BIEF facilitates the electron localization around the interface and enables high valence W and more exposed binding sites in the surface W5N4 shell for accelerating the water dissociation step, ultimately leading to a remarkable reduction in the energy barriers of RDS from 1.40 eV to 0.26 eV. Theoretical calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis results demonstrated that surface W5N4 serves as the active species for HER. Moreover, the ultra&#8208;thin shell characteristics enable the optimized W5N4 with enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity to be fully exposed as active sites. Consequently, the Ni3N@W5N4 exhibits exceptional performance in alkaline HER (60 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2) and remarkable long&#8208;term stability (500 mA cm&#8208;2 for 100 hours). When employed as the cathode in the AEMWE device, the synthesized Ni3N@W5N4 demonstrates stable performance for over 80 hours at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Applications of an Amide Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linchpin reagents are building blocks that can be chemoselectively functionalized to afford products with a common, useful functional group. In this work, we describe the development and validation of the first amide linchpin reagent and demonstrate its use as a doubly electrophilic building block for the synthesis of a variety of amides, including challenging classes. The linchpin reagent was first functionalized via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic amination. Selected masked C&#8208;isocyanate products were then further derivatized with Grignard reagents to produce secondary amides, or tertiary amides if an alkylating agent was added subsequently. The success of this sequence relies on fully controlled reactivity at each electrophilic site, first exploiting the weak N&#8208;O bond and then, the ability to form the free isocyanate intermediate in situ. The overall transformation proceeds with high chemoselectivity, demonstrating the ability of this new linchpin reagent to form amides through atypical bond construction. Finally, the potential of this reagent as a more broadly applicable NCO linchpin is demonstrated by the formation of lactams and unsymmetrical ureas.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrothermal Stability of Active Sites in Cu&#8208;exchanged Small&#8208;pore Zeolites for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computational modelling shows unequivocally the distribution of active species in fresh and hydrothermally aged Cu&#8208;CHA and Cu&#8208;AEI zeolites during NH3&#8208;assisted selective catalytic reduction of NOx. Four principal species co&#8208;exist: (i) CuI cations coordinated to NH3, (ii) CuI cations coordinated to the zeolite framework, (iii) solvated CuII cations, and (iv) framework&#8208;coordinated CuII species (CuIIst) formed upon hydrothermal ageing of the zeolite sample. The CuIIst species were only observed in the hydrothermally aged zeolite samples and are formed upon the interaction of hydrated CuII cations with extra&#8208;framework Al generated during the hydrothermal treatment. These sites are inactive for NOx reduction, leading to a decrease in the catalytic performance of the hydrothermally aged zeolites. CuIIst formation was higher in Cu&#8208;CHA (~46%) than in Cu&#8208;AEI (~28%). The better hydrothermal stability of Cu in the AEI framework is attributed to the tortuous channel structure of AEI that hinders the migration of hydrated CuII cations during hydrothermal ageing.</dc:description>

         <title>Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is a key method used to prepare optically pure compounds in 100% theoretical yield starting from racemic substrates by combining the interconversion of substrate enantiomers with an enantioselective transformation. Various chemoenzymatic DKR approaches have been developed to deracemize secondary alcohols, typically requiring an organic solvent to facilitate enantioselective acylation, primarily catalyzed by lipases, alongside racemization mediated by an achiral, non&#8208;enzymatic catalyst. Achieving both steps in an aqueous solution remained elusive. Here, we report a DKR of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous solution requiring only two biocatalysts. The first key to success was to achieve fast racemization in a buffer employing a non&#8208;stereoselective variant of alcohol dehydrogenase (Lk&#8208;ADH&#8208;Prince) via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence. Engineered variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) enabled enantioselective acyl transfer in water. Besides the appropriate choice of the enzymes, identifying a suitable acyl donor was a second key to the success. The DKR was successfully demonstrated using (R)&#8208;selective MsAcT variants for a broad range of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols using 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl acetate as the acyl donor, yielding (R)&#8208;acetates with up to &gt;99% conv. and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (83&#8211;99.9% ee). The (S)&#8208;acetates were accessible using a stereocomplementary (S)&#8208;selective MsAcT variant.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly presents a remarkable approach for creating intricate structures by positioning nanomaterials in precise locations, with control over molecular interactions. For example, material arrays with interplanar distances similar to the wavelength of light can generate structural color through complex interactions like scattering, diffraction, and interference. Moreover, enzymes, plasmonic nanoparticles, and luminescent materials organized in periodic lattices are envisioned to create functional materials with various applications. Focusing on structural DNA nanotechnology, here, we summarized the recent developments of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional lattices made purely from DNA nanostructures. We review DNA&#8208;based monomer design for different lattices, guest molecule assembly, and inorganic material coating techniques and discuss their functional properties and potential applications in photonic crystals, nanoelectronics, and bioengineering as well as future challenges and perspectives.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Chiral Separation Based on Alkali&#8208;proof Protein Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral separation plays a pivotal role in both practical applications and industrial productions. However, traditional chiral stationary phases (CSPs) exhibit inherent instability in alkaline environments, presenting a significant challenge despite their importance. Herein, basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based CSPs that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. An in&#8208;depth theoretical simulation is conducted to unveil the unique three&#8208;dimensional conformation of alcalase, showing selective affinity towards various enantiomers of chiral amino acids and drugs, especially acidic substrates. Subsequently, an in situ assembly strategy is used to immobilize alcalase within a hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platform. The generated protein&#8208;based CSPs enable successful baseline separation (resolution &#8805; 1.50) for various value&#8208;added compounds (e.g., non&#8208;steroidal drug, RS&#8208;flurbiprofen; nucleotide analog, RS&#8208;tenofovir) via high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, surpassing the commercial chiral column. Furthermore, a systematic study reveals that increasing hydrophilicity and pore sizes of COFs can enhance the separation performance. Remarkably, the obtained CSPs demonstrated exceptional durability, maintaining performance for &gt;2,400 runs. This study provides a new membrane to the protein library for CSPs, and represents an innovative and effective platform for CSPs with immense potential for the enantioseparation of acidic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atomic Cu&#8211;C3 Sites Catalyzed Interfacial Chemistry in Bi@C for Ultra&#8211;Stable and Ultrafast Sodium&#8211;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating interfacial chemistry at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface by designing catalytic electrode material is crucial and challenging for optimizing battery performance. Herein, a novel single atom Cu regulated Bi@C with Cu&#8211;C3 site (Bi@SA Cu&#8211;C) have been designed via the simple pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic framework. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate the Cu&#8211;C3 sites accelerate the dissociation of P&#8211;F and C&#8211;O bonds in NaPF6&#8211;ether&#8211;based electrolyte and catalyze the formation of inorganic&#8211;rich and powerful solid electrolyte interphase. In addition, the Cu&#8211;C3 sites with delocalized electron around Cu trigger an uneven charge distribution and induce an in&#8211;plane local electric field, which facilitates the adsorption of Na+ and reduces the Na+ migration energy barrier. Consequently, the obtained Bi@SA Cu&#8211;C achieves a state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art reversible capacity, ultrahigh rate capability, and long&#8211;term cycling durability. The as&#8211;constructed full cell delivers a high capacity of 351 mAh g&#8722;1 corresponding to an energy density of 265 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides a new strategy to realize high&#8211;efficient sodium ion storage for alloy&#8211;based anode through constructing single&#8211;atom modulator integrated catalysis and promotion effect into one entity.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Chiral COFs Membrane for Enantioselective Amino Acid Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating chiral molecules in the covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniformly ordered pores results in chiral COFs, which have been highly promising candidates for enantioseparation. Herein, a homochiral COF nanochannel membrane is reported by introducing chiral centers (L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester) into one of the organic ligands for the enantioseparation of chiral amino acids. The separation results show that the D&#8208;isomer is preferentially transported through the porous membrane channel. This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D&#8208;isomer over L&#8208;isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size&#8208;matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.</dc:description>

This composite membrane exhibits excellent selectivity for racemic phenylalanine with the highest enantiomeric excess value of up to 99.4%. The adsorption and molecular modeling studies substantiate the experiment results by showing higher bonding affinity towards D-isomer over L-isomer. The excellent enantioselective gating performance unveils the porous COF skeleton with chiral selectors and the size-matching synergy for stereoselective interactions with chiral isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation towards the formation of synthetic coacervate droplets represents a rapidly advancing frontier in the fields of synthetic biology, material science, and biomedicine. These artificial constructures mimic the biophysical principles and dynamic features of natural biomolecular condensates that are pivotal for cellular regulation and organization. Via adapting biological concepts, synthetic condensates with dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provide crucial insights into the fundamental cell processes and regulation of complex biological pathways. They are increasingly designed with the ability to display more complex and ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, which offer innovative solutions for cytomimetic modeling and engineering active materials with sophisticated functions. In this minireview, we highlight recent advancements in the design and construction of synthetic coacervate droplets; including their biomimicry structure and organization to replicate life&#8208;like properties and behaviors, and the dynamic control towards engineering active coacervates. Moreover, we highlight the unique applications of synthetic coacervates as catalytic centers and promising delivery vehicles, so that these biomimicry assemblies can be translated into practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shielding Fluoride Ion Basicity through Diurea Coordination for Nonaqueous Fluoride Shuttle Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong basicity of fluoride ions leads to detrimental nucleophilic attack on organic components in the electrolytes, such as &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination reactions with organic cations and solvents, converting &#8220;naked&#8221; F&#8722; into corrosive and unstable bifluoride (HF2&#8722;) ions. These reactions significantly constrain the choice of suitable solvents and salts to develop electro(chemical) stable fluoride ion electrolytes. In this work, we replaced the triple water ligands typically present in industrial&#160;organic fluoride salts with dual 1,3&#8208;diphenylurea (DPU) coordination via hydrogen bonding interaction. This modification successfully suppressed the Lewis basicity of fluoride ions, providing long&#8208;term chemical stability (over 1000 hours) across&#160;a wide range of aprotic solvents, a broadened electrochemical stability window (&#8208;2.5 ~ 0.9 V vs. Ag+/Ag) and high ionic conductivity (1.7 mS cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. Additionally, the weaker hydrogen bonding in F&#8722;&#8208;DPU coordination, compared to the conventional boron&#8208;based anion acceptor (AA) strategy that relies on intensive Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions, facilitates faster (de)fluorination kinetics&#160;at the electrode. The proposed room temperature fluoride ion batteries sustain improved electrochemical performance by pairing with the Pb&#8208;PbF2 anode and BiF3 or Ag cathode.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel biosynthetic pathway towards the rare and underexplored non&#8208;canonical family of homoterpenes was discovered in actinobacteria through targeted genome mining and enzymatic in vitro reconstitution. The pathway comprises initial methylation&#8208;induced double bond isomerization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (2E,7E)&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;farnesyl diphosphate, catalyzed by a novel family of methyltransferases with unique dual function. The resulting linear C16 double bond isomer of FPP constitutes the specific substrate for a distinct family of type I terpene cyclases, catalyzing diverse cyclization reactions. Functional characterization of nine enzyme pairs led to discovery of five unprecedented homoterpene natural products. The enzymological novelty enable the development of novel biocatalytic and genetically programmable synthetic strategies towards methylated terpenoids with potentially unique properties (&#8220;magic methyl effect&#8221;).</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of 1,2&#8208;Dihydroazete Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fischer carbenes have recently found great utility in the construction of degradable metathesis materials, but investigations have been limited to oxygen&#8208;containing enol ether monomers. Here, the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dihydroazetes is reported. The polymerization proceeds regioselectivity, and the resulting molecular weights are targetable by adjusting the Grubbs initiator loading. Under acidic conditions, the resulting polymers degrade into 3&#8208;aminopropanal derivatives through hydrolysis of the recurring enamide motifs in the polymer backbone. Additionally, the underlying kinetics and thermodynamics of the polymerization were studied through DFT calculations to elucidate the origins of metathesis regioselectivity. This work further expands the suite of monomers available to generate degradable metathesis materials and provides a flexible platform for target applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Stereotactic Anchoring and Spatial Separation of Porphyrins for Amplified Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasound&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is pivotal in specifically inducing pyroptosis of tumor cells. However, the effectiveness of pyroptosis is generally hindered by the constraints of ROS generation efficiency. Herein, a new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF) was rationally designed via an innovative dual&#8208;solvent strategy to amplify ROS generation for ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis. The crystal structure of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF was elucidated by continuous rotation electron diffraction technique, revealing its regular and rigid conformation. The porphyrin molecules were precisely oriented and firmly confined within the scaffold, effectively restricting intramolecular motion. The ample distance of 6.8 &#197; between two porphyrin molecules confirmed the absence of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in the Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF framework, thereby avoiding the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Furthermore, the permanent porosity and expansive surface area of Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF enhanced its interaction with oxygen. These ingenious structural features endowed Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF with a unique ability to generate a large amount of singlet oxygen under ultrasound activation. Meanwhile, the impetus of ultrasound also accelerated the rate of the Fenton reaction catalyzed by iron ions, significantly boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Benefiting from the dual amplification of ROS, Fe(TCPP)&#8208;MOF could efficiently induce tumor cells pyroptosis under ultrasound stimulation, thereby intensifying the potency of cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) delivers small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to enhance radiotherapy. CMOL@siRNAs not only increases energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation, but also effectively delivers an siRNA cocktail to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. CMOL@siRNAs plus X&#8208;ray irradiation shows remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models.







Abstract
Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9&#8201;% and 91.4&#8201;% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.

         <title>Scalable Atomic&#8208;Layer Tailoring of Abundant Oxide Supports Unlocks Superior Interfaces for Low&#8208;Metal&#8208;Loading Dehydrogenation</title>

TOC illustrates an approach to hydrogen release using low&#8208;load Pt on ALD&#8208;TiO2&#8208;modified &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 pellets for the dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), such as methylcyclohexane and hydrogenated biphenyl/diphenylmethane mixture. The cost&#8208;efficient catalytic reactor is crucial for LOHC import scenarios, enabling effective hydrogen storage, release and transport within existing infrastructure.







Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a promising solution for global hydrogen infrastructure, but their practical application faces two key challenges: sluggish dehydrogenation processes and the reliance on catalysts with high noble metal loadings. This study presents a scalable approach to reduce noble metal usage while maintaining high catalytic activity. We synthesized an ultralow Pt content (0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) catalyst using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;based pellet support with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiO2. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that the thin ALD&#8208;TiO2 shell provides a heterogeneous interface, confining electronically rich Pt&#8208;nanoparticle ensembles. The catalyst outperforms both equivalent Pt&#8208;content catalysts and a commercial 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst in homocyclic LOHC dehydrogenation. This study provides insights into the beneficial role of ALD&#8208;engineered interfaces for catalytic supports and offers an efficient approach for scalable production of low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;content catalysts, with implications for various catalytic processes.

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a perovskite quantum dot (QD)&#8208;dye system for efficient energy transfer (ET) from QDs to dyes occurring via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type interaction, at minimal donor&#8208;acceptor spectral overlap. Dyes containing a dimethyl iminium binding group as part of their conjugated system are chosen for high binding affinity to QD surface, crucial for donor&#8208;acceptor spatial wavefunction overlap for efficient ET.







Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes to CsPbBr3 surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications, such as lighting.

         <title>Enhancing the Cumulene Character of One&#8208;Dimensional Acetylene&#8208;Based Systems by Stimuli&#8208;Induced Planarization of Their Two Pro&#8208;diradicaloid Cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene, through an acetylene bridge has been shown to increase the cumulene character in one&#8208;dimensional acetylene&#8208;based conjugates. Spectroscopic analysis and calculations indicate significant &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization during the low temperature&#8208;promoted planarization of the conjugates, which in turn enhances the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge.







Abstract
Acetylene/polyynes &#8722;(C&#8801;C&#8722;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.

         <title>Hydrogenating Polyethylene Terephthalate into Degradable Polyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt;87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and degradability in mildly acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil.







Abstract
The recycling and upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most widely used polyester plastic globally, has attracted growing attention concerning its disposal as non&#8208;degradable waste in the natural environment. Transforming end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET into (bio)degradable polyester offers a novel approach to managing its waste. In this study, we introduce a simple process capable of converting waste PET into degradable polyester, polyethylene terephthalate&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PET&#8208;PECHD), by partly hydrogenating the aromatic rings (x) into aliphatic ones (y). The polyesters with variable x/y compositions ranging from 100/0 to 0/100 can be achieved, and the molecular weight (Mw) can be maintained when x/y &gt;87/13 due to the nonobvious depolymerization. Pronounced depolymerization would occur with deeper hydrogenation, which generates a blend of PET&#8208;PECHD and polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) with lower Mw, and finally a single&#8208;type polymer PECHD. The PET&#8208;PECHD demonstrates comparable thermal stability and mechanical strength compared to PET, along with superior extensibility, barrier properties, and (bio)degradability in acidic, alkaline solutions, and moist soil. This research highlights the potential for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale production of degradable polyester from real&#8208;life plastic waste.

         <title>Co&#8208;Feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;Supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst effectively facilitates co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran aromatization reactions, preferring the dehydro&#8208;aromatization pathways based on cyclopentenones and alkenes over those based on benzofurans. Additionally, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 enhance the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke.







Abstract
Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97&#8201;%, generating &gt;85&#8201;% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05&#8201;%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3&#8201;% to 8.6&#8201;%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

         <title>Dendritic Molecular Baskets for Selective Binding of Toxic Methotrexate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic molecular baskets are biocompatible cavitands capable of including toxic methotrexate (MTX) in their aromatic cavity. The binding is chemoselective with the complex forming in competitive cell media. With the unique mode of recognition and modular structure, dendritic baskets are leading candidates for developing effective antidotes against MTX poisoning.







Abstract
We describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and bioactivity of dendritic basket 612&#8722;. This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (S)&#8208;glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self&#8208;association. 1H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between 612&#8722; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX2&#8722;) in water (Kd=9.2&#8197;&#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX2&#8722; folds inside 612&#8722; (&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N&#8208;methyl group. In consequence, 612&#8722; selectively binds MTX2&#8722; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC50&gt;150&#8197;&#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;6]14&#8722; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX2&#8722; as dihydrofolate reductase's affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of 612&#8722;. Nonetheless, considering the basket's biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Emission Utilizing Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photon&#8208;upconversion (PUC) processes in organic molecular systems, such as triplet&#8208;triplet upconversion and hot&#8208;band absorption, are promising technologies for future energy harvesting. Although these processes can generate high&#8208;energy excitons compared to excitation energy, a PUC process with a high yield and no energy loss has not been established and, therefore, is highly desired. Here, we propose an alternative PUC mechanism that uses reverse intersystem crossing on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. This process combines a triplet sensitizer and a TADF molecule, generating a triplet in the former and transferring it to the latter. Specifically, the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 (sensitizer) to CzBSe (TADF) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18 eV. We found that the triplet energy transfer rate strongly depends on the triplet radiative decay rate of TADF molecules and the difference in Gibbs energy between the energy acceptor and donor. Our findings will contribute to understanding triplet energy transfer dynamics in organic energy donor&#8208;acceptor systems and will lead to various applications, such as future optical cooling systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Scenario for a Carbon&#8208;Neutral Ammonia&#8208;Fueled Engine Mediated by Catalytic NH3&#160;Cracking and CO2&#160;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing near zero&#8208;carbon NH3 as fuel in engines is promising for carbon&#8208;neutrality. However, the application of NH3 into the engine suffers from the intrinsic poor combustion characteristics of NH3 and the emission of harmful NOx exhausts. Herein, we proposed and successfully confirmed a novel scenario for converting a conventional "CH4&#8208;fueled"&#160;engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 was used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust. Afterwards, we put forward two routes to convert the exhaust and NH3 into N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle. The first "spatially decoupled"&#160;route splits the exhaust treatment into NH3 cracking over Ru clusters on the calcined Mg&#8208;Al hydrotalcite (Ru/MAO) and CO2 methanation over a commercial Ni/Al2O3. Both NH3 and CO2 were almost completely converted into the target products under their respective optimal conditions. The second &#8220;spatially coupled&#8221; route refers to an one&#8208;pot reaction of NH3 and CO2 into N2, CH4, and H2O. Due to the mismatch of reaction conditions and the competitive adsorption of reactants, the conversions of NH3 and CO2 were lowered to 80.1% and 49.3%, respectively, over Ru/MAO under 1 bar (CO2:NH3 = 3:8) at 550 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Peptide&#8208;derived Proteolysis&#8208;targeting Chimera (PROTAC) Nanoparticles for Tumor&#8208;targeted and Durable PD&#8208;L1 Degradation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising technique for the specific and durable degradation of cancer&#8208;related proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in cancer treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs is restricted due to their hydrophobicity, poor cell permeability and insufficient tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Herein, we develop the self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) for precise and durable programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) degradation in targeted tumors. The PT&#8208;NPs with an average size of 211.8 nm are formed through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC (CLQKTPKQC&#8208;FF&#8208;ALAPYIP), comprising a PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting &#8216;CLQKTPKQC&#8217;, self&#8208;assembling linker &#8216;FF&#8217; and E3 ligase recruiting &#8216;ALAPYIP&#8217;. Particularly, PT&#8208;NPs strongly bind to tumor cell surface PD&#8208;L1 to form PD&#8208;L1/PT&#8208;NPs complex, then internalized through receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Second, free PROTACs released from PT&#8208;NPs to the cytoplasm further induce the durable proteolysis of cytoplasmic PD&#8208;L1 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected PT&#8208;NPs accumulate significantly at targeted tumor tissues through nanoparticle&#8208;derived passive and active targeting. At the targeted tumor tissues, PT&#8208;NPs promote durable PD&#8208;L1 degradation and ultimately trigger a substantial antitumor immune response. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC NPs to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.</dc:description>

Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self-assembled peptide-derived PROTAC NPs to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen radical enabling industrial&#8208;level oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and water, powered by renewable electricity, provides a highly attractive alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive autoxidation process presently used in industry, but much remains unknown about this two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR), especially the local proton effect. Here, we have investigated the function of hydrogen&#8208;associated intermediates in the 2e&#8208;ORR using a rationally designed cooperative electrode material with cobalt (II) clusters embedded onto the oxidized carbon nanotube composites (Co&#8208;OCNT). We found that the local proton availability can determine both the reaction kinetics and selectivity. A 2e&#8208;ORR process involving hydrogen radical transfer is confirmed. Specifically, the carbon sites from the OCNTs promote proton production, and the cobalt sites from the Co cluster facilitate ORR intermediate formation. The high local proton availability and the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites both contribute to the superior reaction kinetics and selectivity of the Co&#8208;OCNT, reaching an H2O2 production rate of ~13.4 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 90% at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Further cascading the 2e&#8208;ORR with the electro&#8208;Fenton process shows a high selectivity of oxalic acid up to 97% for the valorization of ethylene glycol.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Formate Ester Transfer Hydrogenation Enables an Electrochemical/Thermal Organometallic Cascade for Methanol Synthesis from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy&#8208;dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low&#8208;temperature and &#8208;pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H&#8208;PNP)Ir(H)3 (H&#8208;PNP = HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room&#8208;temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a prototype for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that will guide the design and development of multicatalyst cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Oxidation Catalyzed by Perovskites: The Role of Crystallographic Distortions Highlighted by Systematic Experiments and Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The identification of physical parameters correlated with the performance constitutes a fundamental step for the discovery of catalytic materials. Through a cooperative approach between rigorous experiments and AI, we identify a descriptor for the activity of perovskites in CO oxidation that depends on a parameter reflecting crystallographic distortions as well as on the elemental properties of A and B.







Abstract
The identification of key materials&#8217; parameters correlated with the performance can accelerate the development of heterogeneous catalysts and unveil the relevant underlying physical processes. However, the analysis of correlations is often hindered by inconsistent data. Besides, nontrivial, yet unknown relationships may be important, and the intricacy of the various processes may be significant. Here, we tackle these challenges for the CO oxidation catalyzed by perovskites using a combination of rigorous experiments and artificial intelligence. A series of 13 ABO3 (A=La, Pr, Nd, Sm; B=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) perovskites was synthesized, characterized, and tested in catalysis. To the resulting dataset, we applied the symbolic&#8208;regression SISSO approach. We identified an analytical expression correlated with the activity that contains the normalized unit&#8208;cell volume, the Pauling electronegativity of the elements A and B, and the ionization energy of the element B. Therefore, the activity is described by crystallographic distortions and by the chemical nature of A and B elements. The generalizability of the identified descriptor is confirmed by the good quality of the predictions for 3 additional ABO3 and 16 chemically more complex AMn(1&#8208;x)B&#8217;xO3 (A=La, Pr, Nd; B&#8217;=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) perovskites.

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinel oxide, Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen is developed by high&#8208;throughput methods. The lattice oxygen activation is facilitated by Cr oxidation (Cr3+&#8594;Cr6+), accompanied by cation migration from octahedral to tetrahedral sites. This geometric conversion generates oxygen non&#8208;bonding states essential for lattice oxygen oxidation. Oxidized oxygen species are stabilized through dimerization with CrO4 tetrahedra (d0 Cr6+). The oxide demonstrates high activity and stability at high current densities.







Abstract
Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with outstanding stability for over 170&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6 octahedrons to CrO4 tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non&#8208;bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8722;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of the Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom site can be tuned by preferentially removing the pyrrolic nitrogen over the pyridinic nitrogen, resulting in a shorter Fe&#8722;N to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, and promoting an in&#8208;plane oxygen reconstruction to lower the energy barrier in the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalyst with the modified Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom sites exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis in a Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C with shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds also favors the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~720&#8197;h of continuous cycling.

&lt;p&gt;The coordination environment of the Fe/Co dual-atom site can be tuned by preferentially removing the pyrrolic nitrogen over the pyridinic nitrogen, resulting in a shorter Fe&#8722;N to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, and promoting an in-plane oxygen reconstruction to lower the energy barrier in the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalyst with the modified Fe/Co dual-atom sites exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis in a Zn-air battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-atom catalysts with nitrogen-coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual-atom catalysts of FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C can undergo out-plane and in-plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C with shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds also favors the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual-atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and exhibit no notable decline after ~720&#8197;h of continuous cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Monoborylation of Methane by a Mono Bipyridyl&#8208;Nickel(II) Hydride Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework confined mono bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species is highly efficient for selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis. This heterogeneous and recyclable single&#8208;site nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane to afford methylboronic acid pinacol ester (CH3Bpin) in 98&#8201;% selectivity with a turnover number up to 1388.







Abstract
We report the development of an earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst for methane C&#8722;H borylation. The post&#8208;synthetic metalation of bipyridine&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with NiBr2, followed by treatment with NaEt3BH affords MOF&#8208;supported monomeric bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species via active site isolation. The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200&#8201;&#176;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH3Bpin in 61&#8201;% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH2&#8208;species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8722;Ni catalyst, its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl&#8208;nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover&#8208;limiting &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF&#8208;based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Bimagnetic Core/Shell Nanoprobes with Tunable Exchange Coupling for High Resolution and Sensitive Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimagnetic core/shell nanotracers with the exchange coupling facilitate high resolution and sensitive magnetic particle imaging. At equivalent mass concentrations, bimagnetic core/shell nanotracers show a 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieves a resolution of 1&#8197;mm compared to conventional tracers like VivoTrax. The excellent MPI performance contributes to the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice.







Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has demonstrated versatile applications in biomedicine, including tumor imaging, cell tracking, and image&#8208;guided hyperthermia. Despite these advancements, the prevalent use of clinically approved tracers has posed limitations on MPI&#8242;s resolution and sensitivity. In this study, we engineered a bimagnetic core/shell nanocrystals (BMCS) tailored for MPI by optimizing the heterostructure and modulating the exchange coupling effect between the two magnetic components. The resulting BMCS exhibited remarkably heightened susceptibility and magnetization while maintaining low coercivity, thereby substantially improved both MPI resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional tracers such as VivoTrax. At an equivalent mass concentration, BMCS demonstrated a notable 5.08&#8208;fold increase in signal intensity and achieved an unprecedentedly high resolution down to 1&#8197;mm. The excellent MPI performance contributes to high resolution MPI and the sensitive detection of orthotopic colorectal cancer in mice. The design strategy employed in BMCS, centered on the exchange coupling effect, introduces an efficacious approach for the development of high performance MPI tracers.

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier Lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tunable intraband defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir in WO3&#8211;x/In2S3 S&#8208;Scheme heterojunctions, effectively prolonging charge carrier lifetime through rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons. Furthermore, it unlocks the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, facilitating H2O photooxidation and thereby boosting CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Alternating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroarene for Efficient Photothermal Conversion via Boosting Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, is designed and synthesized for efficient photothermal conversion. With features including mixed D&#8208;A interactions, local aromaticity, self&#8208;absorption, and narrow bandgap, it optimizes non&#8208;radiative decay, achieving high photothermal efficiency and therapeutic capabilities against tumors. Unlike traditional twisted structures, this ladder&#8208;type fused heteroarene design offers a promising molecular engineering approach for advancing organic phototheranostic agents.







Abstract
The development of novel ladder&#8208;type conjugated molecules is crucial for advancing supramolecular chemistry and material science. In this study, we report a straightforward synthesis of new alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, and demonstrate its application as photothermal agent for imaging and cancer therapy. FCDTDPP is constructed by vinylene bridge between cyclopentadithiophene (D) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (A) through intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts type reaction. FCDTDPP exhibits unique combination of good molecular planarity, efficient intra&#8208;/intermolecular mixed D&#8208;A interactions, and local aromaticity. These features collectively contribute to its broad and intense absorptions with narrow band gap in red band of the spectra, coupled with multiple vibrational absorption feature, thereby enhancing non&#8208;radiative decay process and resulting in efficient photothermal conversion property. FCDTDPP and its nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit superior photothermal conversion performance and stability under 660&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Moreover, in vitro studies reveal that FCDTDPP NPs possess excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and robust photothermal therapeutic efficacy, a finding further corroborated by preliminary in vivo experiments in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work charts a novel course for the molecular engineering of organic photothermal conversion systems, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Modulating the Aggregation States of a Pd6L4 Cage for Selectivity Flipping during the Stereo&#8208;Divergent Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes to yield E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes was catalyzed by a Pd6L4 octahedral cage, with the solvent judiciously modulating the reaction, thereby unlocking off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity of the product. The dispersed metal&#8208;organic cage and the solid&#8208;state cage halted the reaction at its intermediate stage, while the aggregated supramolecular cage expedited the Z&#8208;to&#8208;E isomerization process within the confined hydrophobic nanospace.







Abstract
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic system has been established using a singular palladium&#8208;based octahedral cage as the supramolecular reactor, deftly unlocking the off&#8208;on&#8208;off selectivity in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Water serves as a critical regulator, modulating the catalyst states, reaction rates, and endpoints. The choice of solvent system influences the activity of host&#8211;guest binding and the reaction types of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, effectively modifying the reaction steps involved in the Z&#8594;E isomerization during the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. Kinetic and inhibition experiments indicate that the catalyst mimics the binding and activation characteristics of enzymes towards substrates, enabling selective transformations within the confined enzyme&#8208;mimicking environment. The utility of this switchable cage&#8208;confined catalysis has been demonstrated in the synthesis and modification of complex biologically active molecules with controllable E/Z selectivity. This work sheds light on the design and control of artificial supramolecular counterparts of enzymes, offering fundamental insights into the factors influencing the activity and catalytic selectivity of biological macromolecules.

         <title>Generation of Bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron Enolates from Alkynes and Their Catalyst&#8208;Free Alkyne Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct comprising tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] and 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide reacts with alkynes to generate bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates. The strong Lewis acidity of these boron enolates facilitates the coupling reaction with various unactivated alkynes, resulting in the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in one pot.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions are powerful synthetic tools for constructing organic molecular frameworks. In this study, strongly Lewis acidic bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolates were generated from alkynes through oxygen transfer from 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide using tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. Boron enolates were highly reactive owing to the strong Lewis acidity of the boron centers, and thus immediately coupled with alkynes. N&#8208;Ethynylphthalimide reacted as an alkyne with 2,6&#8208;dibromopyridine N&#8208;oxide and B(C6F5)3 to form a semi&#8208;stable bis(pentafluorophenyl)boron enolate through the coordination of the carbonyl group to the boron center. This enolate underwent coupling with another alkyne.

         <title>Pore Structure Modulation in Kirigamic Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional kirigami mechanics of a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) in the solid state are demonstrated through mechanical and molecular stimuli. By controlling these external stimuli, the molecular framework of the ZIF undergoes significant changes, with up to a 37&#8201;% alteration in unit&#8208;cell parameters. This unique folding behavior also leads to programmable pore structures in this channel&#8208;type ZIF, functioning similarly to check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifolds to regulate fluid flow.







Abstract
Paper crafts, such as origami and kirigami, have become an interdisciplinary research theme transportable from art to science, and further to engineering. Kirigami&#8208;inspired architectural design strategies allow the establishment of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mechanical linkages with unprecedented mechanical properties. Herein, we report a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), displaying folding mechanics based on a kirigami tessellation, originated from the double&#8208;corrugation surface (DCS) pattern. Pressure&#8208; and guest&#8208;induced responses demonstrate the kirigami mechanism of the ZIF, wherein imidazolate linkers act as hinges, controlling pore dimensionality, resembling the check valve&#8208;adapted mechanical manifold. This discovery of the kirigami tessellation inside a flexible ZIF reveals foldable mechanics at the molecular level.

         <title>Upcycling Iron Oxide Scale Slag into a High&#8208;Performance, Sustainable Ozone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Iron oxide scale slag by creating a compact junction between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phases, their synergistic effect could be harnessed by inhibiting passivation of the Fe2O3 surface and enhancing the catalytic conversion of the adsorbed O3 on the Fe3O4 surface, thus reducing catalyst deactivation and improving the treatment ability of practical antibiotic wastewater (after 2&#8197;h treatment, COD removal rate 81.7&#8201;%).







Abstract
Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70&#8201;% Fe2O3 and 40.30&#8201;% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70&#8201;% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.

         <dc:description>
Utilizing a synergistic &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral&#8208;locking strategy, we constructed a high&#8208;order B/N&#8208;based pure&#8208;green MR&#8208;TADF emitter via a lithium&#8208;free synthetic approach. The associated device achieved narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74), a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a lifetime (LT80) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power&#8208;efficient, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR&#8208;TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter&#8208;system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR&#8208;TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15&#8197;nm, but also exhibit close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation.

Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT80) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.

&lt;p&gt;Utilizing a synergistic &#960;-extension and peripheral-locking strategy, we constructed a high-order B/N-based pure-green MR-TADF emitter via a lithium-free synthetic approach. The associated device achieved narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74), a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% with minimal efficiency roll-off, and a lifetime (LT&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters offer natural advantages for creating power-efficient, wide-color-gamut OLEDs. However, current green MR-TADF emitters face challenges in simultaneously achieving high color purity and efficient reverse inter-system crossing (RISC), leading to suboptimal device performance. In this study, we propose a synergistic molecular design approach that combines &#960;-extension and peripheral locking to address these challenges. This approach allows for the construction of quadruple borylated MR-TADF emitters that not only deliver precisely tuned pure-green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15&#8197;nm, but also exhibit close-to-unity quantum yield, rapid RISC, and optimal horizontal dipole orientation. The resulting sensitizer-free OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.74) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% at maximum and 31.8&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the device shows good operational stability, with a lifetime (LT&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) of 485&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study hence offers a promising molecular design strategy that effectively enhances the comprehensive OLED performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Confined Synthesis of BiVO4 Nanocluster for Urea Production with Remarkable O2/N2 Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyoxometalate constrained strategy was proposed to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanoclusters by premixing [V10O28]6&#8722; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The obtained BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can effectively drive the co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 in the presence of O2/Ar/N2 to achieve a record urea yield in the mixed atmosphere.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8722; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8722; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8722; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33&#8201;% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8722; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2&#8208;framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction was reported for the first time, which achieves the superior photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. The abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and the significantly improved the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability induced by the enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields should be the crucial factors.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.28&#8197;times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24&#8197;times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;Chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selective photooxidation of commodity and postconsumer polyolefins to produce materials with in&#8208;chain ketones without using catalysts or expensive oxidants. Under mild conditions, yields reached up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones, improving adhesion compared to unfunctionalized plastics. These ketones enable reaction with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks, upcycling mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced properties.







Abstract
Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23&#8197;mol&#8201;% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 32 stereoisomers of halisphingosine A in 11&#8211;13 steps with good overall yields. Comparative NMR studies resolved a longstanding structural misconception, leading to the revision of halisphingosine A. Our synthetic analytical study provides an unparalleled level of detail on the challenges associated with determining the structures of non&#8208;model sphingoid bases, and will catalyse future research in marine metabolomics and sphingolipid metabolism.







Abstract
Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine A core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8211;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of 32 stereoisomers of halisphingosine A in 11&#8211;13 steps with good overall yields. Comparative NMR studies resolved a longstanding structural misconception, leading to the revision of halisphingosine A. Our synthetic analytical study provides an unparalleled level of detail on the challenges associated with determining the structures of non-model sphingoid bases, and will catalyse future research in marine metabolomics and sphingolipid metabolism.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late-stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine A core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,8&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-2-aminooctadec-9-ene-1,3,8-triol, and to pursue further structure&#8211;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base-sensing receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Tailored EDL Induced Triple&#8208;Layer SEI on High&#8208;Capacity Anodes Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Durable Sodium&#8208;Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A dense thin triple&#8208;layer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (inner: Se, mediate: inorganic, outer: organic) is formed on Se&#8208;FeS2 anode via Sex2&#8722; anion&#8208;tailored electric double layer in NaCF3SO3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures lower ion transport barrier and greatly suppresses the electrolyte substantial consumption. The Se&#8208;FeS2 enables high reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycling life at fast&#8208;charging mode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity electrodes face a great challenge of cycling stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained electrolyte decomposition for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, Se&#8208;solubility induced Sex2&#8722; as self&#8208;adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing novel triple&#8208;layer SEI (inner layer: Se; mediate layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high&#8208;capacity FeS2 anode as an example for achieving stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Sex2&#8722; in situ generated at 1.30&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na) and was preferentially adsorbed onto EDL of anode, then converted to Se0 as inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Sex2&#8722; causes anion&#8208;enhanced Na+ solvation structure could produce more inorganic (Se0, NaF) and less organic SEI components. The unique triple&#8208;layer SEI with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long&#8208;lifespan at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (383.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, 6000&#8197;cycles, 93.1&#8201;%, 5&#8197;min/cycle). The Se&#8208;induced triple&#8208;layer SEI could be also be formed on high&#8208;capacity SnS2 anode. This work provides a novel SEI model by anion&#8208;tailored EDL towards stable sodium&#8208;storage of high&#8208;capacity anode for fast&#8208;charging.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;throughput screening, natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) was identified as a novel STING antagonist. A concise and scalable total synthesis was accomplished in 6&#8197;steps based on an efficient acid&#8208;promoted tandem deprotection/cyclization reaction to build the pentacyclic structure. Enabled by total synthesis, the therapeutic potential of ATS was elucidated, which lays the foundation for developing an STING antagonist as an effective therapy for autoimmune diseases.







Abstract
Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6&#8197;steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS's mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients. ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS&#8208;induced IBD colitis and Trex1&#8208;/&#8208; autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Chiral 2&#8208;Azetines and Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Allenes Via Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective syntheses of fascinating stable chiral 2&#8208;azetines and axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes were achieved through phosphine&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines.







Abstract
Chiral 2&#8208;azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2&#8208;azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2&#8208;azetines (70&#8211;98&#8201;% yields and up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee) through chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines. These 2&#8208;azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et3SiH, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water at rt for 2&#8197;minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones and sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring&#8208;opening reaction through Et3SiH, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90&#8201;% yields and up to 91&#8201;%&#8197;ee).

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically chiral dimeric molecules can achieve high chirality transfer efficiency when co&#8208;assembled with monomeric counterparts or inorganic nanomaterials, regardless of their packing structures. This process enables the fabrication of chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties, which are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8208;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.

Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) allows for the chiral-selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self-assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upcycling Polyethylene to High&#8208;Purity Hydrogen under Ambient Conditions via Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a mechanocatalytic route for upcycling polyethylene (PE) into high&#8208;purity hydrogen gas (H2, 99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) and metal carbides using ball milling at 45&#8201;&#176;C. Manganese (Mn) catalysts enable a remarkable H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;%. The resulting carbides, which do not promote hydrocarbons formation, further enhance H2 recovery ratio. This method provides an efficient pathway for converting PE to high&#8208;purity H2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most abundant plastic waste, and its conversion to hydrogen (H2) offers a promising route for clean energy generation. However, PE decomposition typically requires high temperatures due to its strong chemical bonds, leading to significant carbon emissions and low H2 selectivity (theoretically less than 75&#8197;vol&#8201;% after accounting for further steam&#8208;reforming reactions). Here, we report a mechanocatalytic strategy that upcycles PE into high&#8208;purity H2 (99.4&#8197;vol&#8201;%) with an exceptional H2 recovery ratio of 98.5&#8201;% (versus 15.7&#8201;% via thermocatalysis), using manganese as a catalyst at a low temperature of 45&#8201;&#176;C. This method achieves a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The marked improvement in H2 recovery ratio is mainly due to metal carbides formation induced by the mechanocatalytic process, which does not catalyze hydrocarbons formation. This work is expected to advance studies of the conversion of polyolefins to high&#8208;purity H2 with net&#8208;zero carbon emissions.

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains non&#8208;blinking until it binds to HaloTag, thereby initiating its spontaneous blinking activity and facilitating its use in live cell SMLM imaging without wash&#8208;out steps. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo is successfully employed in imaging various intracellular structures at the nanoscale, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter &#8220;RDC&#8221; to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol Based on a Molecule/Nanocarbon Hybrid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stable, homogeneous active sites offered by CoPc molecule own suitable binding strength to the reactant and key intermediates of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway. A hybrid photothermal catalyst, which features carbon nanotube anchored CoPc molecules, realizes a near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity due to the synergistic interaction between intrinsically&#8208;efficient CoPc active sites and CNT photothermal supports for affording an optimal reaction temperature.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol conversion provides an intriguing route for both solar energy storage and CO2 mitigation. For scalable applications, near&#8208;unity methanol selectivity is highly desirable to reduce the energy and cost endowed by low&#8208;value byproducts and complex separation processes, but so far has not been achieved. Here we demonstrate a molecule/nanocarbon hybrid catalyst composed of carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc/CNT), which synergistically integrates high photothermal conversion capability for affording an optimal reaction temperature with homogeneous and intrinsically&#8208;efficient active sites, to achieve a catalytic activity of 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of ~99&#8201;% in direct photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reaction. Both theoretical calculations and operando characterizations consistently confirm that the unique electronic structure of CoPc and appropriate reaction temperature cooperatively enable a thermodynamic favorable reaction pathway for highly selective methanol production. This work represents an important milestone towards the development of advanced photothermal catalysts for scalable and cost&#8208;effective CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8208;790 nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450 nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8208;30.7%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic memristors have recently been reshaped into artificial synapses capable of mimicking many fundamental neurosynaptic patterns, while sense digitalization has been increasingly explored to link the neuromorphic devices with external equipment. By inspiration of dopaminergic nerve, here a nanofluidic nerve with sense digitalization is devised by engineering a dopamine (DA)&#8208;specific nanofluidic synapse as mediated by PC&#8208;12 cells to manage the robotic arm. Different from previous neuromorphic perception of DA via redox reaction, the aptamer&#8208;based perception here is based on biological DA recognition by its receptor as indicated by the ionic signals. Various neurosynaptic patterns are emulated with DA&#8208;dependent plasticity, based on which the digital representation of DA perception is used to control the robotic arm.</dc:description>

         <title>A C156 Molecular Nanocarbon: Planar/Rippled Nanosheets Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel hybrid nanocarbon consisting of one rippled and two planar nanosheets has been synthesized and characterized. Two meso pairs of [5]helicenes are formed along the long molecular axis of the hybrid to connect rippled and planar subunits, leading to a stable conformation. It is shown that the hybrid possesses the individual electronic properties of the rippled and planar subunits. Compared to the rippled subunit, such hybrid has a better geometric match to C60 and complexes with C60 in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with the association constant on the order of 105 M&#8208;1. The hybrid displays unusual anti&#8208;Kasha fluorescence emission. The transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the singlet fission (SF) from higher level singlet excited states (Sn) is operative in the film of the hybrid.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Stability and Properties of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide Supramolecular Copolymers through Engineered Coupled Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the stability of multi&#8208;component and functional assemblies such as supramolecular copolymers without impeding their dynamicity is key for their implementation as innovative materials. Up to now, this has been achieved by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, requiring the time&#8208;consuming characterization of a series of supramolecular coassemblies. We report herein that this is possible to significantly enhance the stability of supramolecular copolymers by a minimal change in the chemical nature of one of the interacting monomers. This is achieved by replacing an ester function by an ether function in the structure of a chiral benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, used as &#8220;sergeant&#8221;, coassembled with achiral monomers, the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;. Pseudo&#8208;phase diagrams, constructed by probing the nature of the coassemblies with multifarious analytical techniques, confirm that the greater stability of the resulting copolymers is mainly due to the minimization of competing species. This leads to better rheological and catalytic properties of the corresponding supramolecular copolymers. Favouring coassembly over undesired assembly pathways must be considered as a blueprint for the development of better&#8208;performing supramolecular multi&#8208;component systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P Metathesis &#8208; A Direct Route to Structurally Constrained, Cationic PIII Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound [LP][SbCl4] with an OCO pincer&#8208;type ligand (L) having a central carbene donor was directly synthesized via an Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction between PCl3 and LSb&#8208;Cl. [LP][SbCl4] was isolated and its reactivity with small molecules (ROH and RNH2) was studied, showing that [SbCl4]&#8211; is not an innocent counter anion, but an active participant in these reactions. When the [SbCl4]&#8211; was replaced with the [CB11H12]&#8211; ([Cb]&#8211;) anion, the reactions were redirected to [LP]+ cation only. The reactions with alcohols and amines led to the equilibrium between the products of the formal E&#8722;H (E = O, N) bond oxidative addition to the P&#8208;center and products of the P&#8208;center/ligand&#8208;assisted bond activation. Remarkably, [LP]+ activated the PhO&#8722;H and PhN(H)&#8722;H bonds in a reversible, thermoneutral fashion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we report the reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts that allows selective functionalization of the meta position of arenes. The combination of a site&#8208;selective thianthrenation with a Catellani reaction provides access to 3,5&#8208;dimethylated arenes. The developed reaction is complementary to the previously discovered reductive ipso&#8208;alkylation of aryl thianthrenium salts and extends the possibilities for late&#8208;stage methylation of arenes with a single aryl thianthrenium salt.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Methionine Incorporation into Cyclophilin A by Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis for 19F NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;19 NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. Of particular interest is the exploitation of trifluoromethyl (tfm) groups, given their high sensitivity and superior transverse relaxation properties, compared to single fluorine atoms. However, biosynthetic incorporation of tfm&#8208;bearing amino acids remains challenging due to cytotoxicity and incompatibility with natural tRNA synthetases. Here, we report on overcoming this challenge using cell&#8208;free synthesis, incorporating trifluoromethyl&#8208;methionine (tfmM) into the protein Cyclophilin A (CypA) with remarkably high efficiency, impossible via biosynthetic means. Importantly, we demonstrate that tfmM CypA binds a native substrate, the N&#8208;terminal domain of HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (HIV&#8208;1 CA&#8208;NTD), and retains peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. It also binds the peptide inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) with the same affinity as non&#8208;labeled, wild&#8208;type CypA. Furthermore, we show that 19F isotope shifts and 19F solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) provide valuable structural information on surface exposure. Taken together, our study illustrates that tfmM can readily be incorporated into proteins at very high levels by cell&#8208;free synthesis without disturbing protein structure and function, significantly expanding the scope of 19F NMR spectroscopy for studying protein structure and dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Emulsions for Smart Structures with Multiple Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D printing, and more recently 4D printing, has emerged as a transformative technology for fabricating structures with complex geometries and responsive properties. However, employing functional colloidal solutions as inks for printing remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel and versatile 4D printing approach for fabricating functional and complex&#8208;shaped objects using polymerizable liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets. Leveraging a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technique, we achieve rapid production of intricate 3D geometries with high resolution. The printed structures retain the LC ordering from the precursor droplets, imparting the final objects with shape memory properties, including shape fixation and recovery upon heating or light exposure. Light&#8208;responsive behavior is introduced post&#8208;printing by embedding an azo dye into the 3D structures. Additionally, we explore the potential to create intrinsically porous 3D structures by selectively removing non&#8208;reactive components from the printed geometries, adding an extra level of functionality to the printed objects. Furthermore, we incorporate chiral nematic LCs into the emulsion droplets, producing 3D objects with tunable reflective properties. To our knowledge, this is the first example of DLP 3D printing with emulsions, offering an effective and versatile pathway for developing 4D&#8208;printed materials with potential applications in optics, robotics, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Crystal with Anti&#8208;Stokes Photoluminescent Excitation and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermal activation process utilizes environmental thermal energy to help supplement energy for the nonspontaneous energy&#8208;consuming upconversion physical transitions with positive free energy change (&#916;G &gt; 0). Reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and hot band absorption are two kinds of thermal activation transitions. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with rISC have significantly propelled advancements in organic semiconductors. Hot band absorption, enables anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence, offering a promising route for efficient photon upconversion. In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ&#8208;DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1 eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ&#8208;DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.</dc:description>

In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor-acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ-DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1 eV anti-Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti-Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ-DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanics&#8208;Photophysics Correlation in Tough, Stretchable and Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescence Ionogels Deciphered by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of tough, stretchable and long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials holds great significance for manufacturing and processing photoluminescent materials, but limited techniques are available to profile their mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation. Here we report glassy ionogels, and their mechanical properties and photophysical properties are fused by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), functioning like a human brain that perceives a material instantaneously by linking sensory perception and cognition. Depending on two special temperatures presented in DMA curves, Tloss (the peak of loss modulus (E&#8221;)) and Tg (glass transition temperature), the ionogels can vary from being either tough with persistent phosphorescence, extensible with effective phosphorescence or resilience with inefficient phosphorescence. Leveraging this method, we achieve stretchable and long&#8208;lived RTP ionogels with tensile yield strength of 53 MPa, tensile strain of 497%, Young&#8217;s modulus of 782 MPa, toughness of 111.2 MJ/m3, and lifetime of 113.05 ms. Our work provides a simple yet powerful method to reveal the mechanics&#8208;photophysics correlation of RTP ionogels, to predict their performance without laborious synthesis and characterization, opening new avenues for applications of RTP materials, including applications in harsh conditions (257 K or 347 K), shape memory and shape reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Low&#8208;Concentration Electroreduction of NO to NH3 via Potential&#8208;Controlled Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic defect states in catalysts are recognized as effective active sites for enhancing the low&#8208;concentration electroreduction of NO to NH3 (NORR). Their structures dynamically evolve with applied potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes&#160;potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over VO&#8208;TiO2&#8208;x&#160;to enhance NORR performance. Combining constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results demonstrate that applying&#160;external potentials&#160;promote&#160;the formation of Ti3+ active sites and alter&#160;its spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Therefore, the VO&#8208;TiO2&#8208;x catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with Faradaic efficiency of 76.4% and&#160;NH3 yield rate of 632.9 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 under 1.0 vol% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with&#160; reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10 vol%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record&#8208;breaking NH3 yield of 2292.7 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric Iodine Transport Layer Enabled High Areal Capacity Dual Plating Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine cathode in aqueous battery has drawn great attention due to its high energy density and high safety. However, iodine has extremely low conductivity of 1&#215;10&#8208;7 S cm&#8208;1, which usually results in low specific capacity. In this work, a PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer was designed to enhance the areal capacity of zinc&#8208;iodine cell. The areal capacity of PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer modified CNT cathode showed twice as higher capacity than that of pure CNT film in a dual&#8208;plating cell, The significant enhancement of the capacity was attributed to the fast iodine transport in the PVA&#8208;hydrogel layer. Besides, the strong interaction between PVA chain and polyiodide anions prevented the shuttle effect. The PVA modified CNT cathode could stably operate for over 3000 hours with remarkably higher capacity and cycle life. We analyzed the uniquely fast transport behavior of polyiodides in PVA hydrogel by in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ optical micrography, as well as DFT calculations. It was found that the strong binding force together with lower dissociation energy of iodine on PVA chain is the dominate reason for reduced shuttle effect and fast polyiodide transport. As a result, the assembled PVA&#8208;I2 pouch cells showed excellent performance in both dual&#8208;plating cells and conventional&#8208;type cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Screened d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Turing Structure of Confined Nickel for Sulfion Oxidation Accelerated Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) could offer an energy&#8208;efficient and tech&#8208;economically favorable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for H2 production. Transition metal (TM) based catalysts have been considered promising candidates for SOR but suffer from limited activity due to the excessive bond strength from TM&#8208;S2&#8208; d&#8208;p orbit coupling. Herein, we propose a feasible strategy of screening direct d&#8208;p orbit hybridization between TM and S2&#8208; by constructing the Turing structure composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets. The optimized p&#8208;p orbit coupling between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8208; enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production. Specifically, it achieves a current density of 500 mA cm&#8208;2 at an ultralow potential of 0.67 V vs. RHE for alkaline SOR. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron transfer from Ni imparts metallicity and a higher p&#8208;band center to carbon shells, thereby contributing to optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization and a thermodynamically favorable stepwise sulfion degradation. Practically, a two&#8208;electrode flow cell achieves an industrial current density of 1 Acm&#8208;2 at an unprecedented low voltage of 0.91 V while maintaining stability for over 300 hours, and exhibits high productivities of 3.83 and 0.32 kgh&#8208;1m&#8208;2 for sulfur and H2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Hubbard Gap Closure&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Redox Li&#8208;Storage Mechanism as the Origin of Anomalously High Capacity and Fast Ion Diffusivity in MOFs&#8208;Like Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOFs&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POMs) electrodes&#160;have already emerged as promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), yet the origins of the underlying redox mechanism in such materials remain a matter of uncertainty. Of critical challenges are the anomalously high storage capacities beyond their theoretical values and the fast ion diffusivity that cannot be satisfactorily comprehended in the theory of crystal lattice. Herein, for the first time we decode t2g electron occupation&#8208;regulated dual&#8208;redox Li&#8208;storage mechanism as the true origin of extra capacity in POMs electrodes. &#160;Enhanced V&#8208;t2g orbital occupation by Li coordination significantly triggers the Hubbard gap closure and reversible Li deposition/dissolution at surface region. Conjugated V&#8208;O&#8208;Li configuration at interlayers endow Li+ ion pathways along pore walls as the dominant contribution to the low migration barrier and fast diffusivity. As a result, remarkable cycle stability (~100 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1), extremely high specific capacity (1200 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (404 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 A g&#8722;1) were achieved, providing new understandings on the underlying mechanism of POMs electrodes and pivotal guidance for dual&#8208;storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Buried Interface for Efficient SAM&#8208;based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) anchored on metal oxides (MO) have greatly boosted the performance of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by serving as hole&#8208;selective contacts due to their distinct advantages in transparency, hole&#8208;selectivity, passivation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and processing efficiency. While the intrinsic monolayer nature of SAMs provides unique advantages, it also makes them highly sensitive to external pressure, posing a significant challenge for long&#8208;term device stability. At present, the stability issue of SAM&#8208;based PVSCs is gradually attracting attention. In this review, we discuss the fundamental stability issues arising from the structural characteristics, operating mechanisms, and roles of SAMs, and highlight representative works on improving their stability. We identify the buried interface stability concerns in three key aspects: 1) SAM/MO interface, 2) SAM inner layer, and 3) SAM/perovskite interface, corresponding to the anchoring group, linker group, and terminal group in the SAMs, respectively. Finally, we have proposed potential strategies for achieving excellent stability in SAM&#8208;based buried interfaces, particularly for large&#8208;scale and flexible applications. We believe this review will deepen understanding of the relationship between SAM structure and their device performance, thereby facilitating the design of novel SAMs and advancing their eventual commercialization in high&#8208;efficiency and stable inverted PVSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Alkenes by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H Functionalization of Arenes with Vinyl Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral tetrasubstituted alkenes are of increasing value and interest in chemistry&#8208;related areas. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains elusive, due to the high steric repulsion and relatively low conformational stability. Herein, we disclose the straightforward construction of atropisomeric tetrasubstituted alkenes via an effective enantiocontrol of vinyl cations. This copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp2)&#8211;H functionalization of sterically hindered (hetero)arenes with vinyl cations enables the efficient and atom&#8208;economical preparation of axially chiral acyclic tetrasubstituted styrenes and pyrrolyl ethylenes with high atroposelectivities. Importantly, this reaction represents the first example for the assembly of axially chiral alkenes through vinyl cation approach. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the reaction mechanism, origin of regioselectivity, Z/E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by diverse product derivatizations, chiral organocatalyst synthesis, as well as further applications in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Applicable Descriptors under Weak Metal&#8208;Oxygen d&#8208;p Interaction for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in water electrolysis and renewable energy conversion processes. Descriptors are utilized to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of OER catalytic materials, yet each descriptor exhibits specificity to particular systems. Currently, there is a lack of effective descriptors to describe the relationship between electronic structure and OER performance in ionic systems. This study reveals for the first time that widely used OER descriptors, the d&#8208;band center and charge transfer energy, are limited in their effectiveness for oxide systems dominated by ionic bonds, in which ionic interactions significantly enhance or suppress the catalytic activity. Furthermore, composite descriptors tailored for ionic systems are proposed, with findings extended to complex multi&#8208;component and high&#8208;entropy oxides. The results indicate that the metal d&#8208;band unoccupied states parameter and the active states parameter can serve as effective OER descriptors for ionic catalytic materials. This work addresses the gap in OER descriptors for ionic systems, offering a new theoretical foundation and guidance for the development of efficient OER catalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed, Regio&#8208;/Stereo&#8208; and Enantiospecific Anti&#8208;Carboxylation of Unactivated Internal Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes enabled via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol. The acetate ligand of the palladium catalyst controls the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity in the desired transformation. The potential of this concept has been demonstrated by the development of the chiral version of this transformation by using axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer with good yields and enantioselectivities. Detailed investigations, including kinetic studies, order studies, and DFT studies, were performed to validate the ligand&#8208;assisted nucleopalladation process and the rationale behind the observed racemization of chiral allenes. The studies also indicated that the anti&#8208;carboxypalladation step was the rate&#8208;limiting as well as the stereo&#8208; and enantiodetermining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitrile Derived Lithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organolithium reagents, known for their low cost, ready availability, and high reactivity, allow fast cross&#8208;coupling under ambient conditions. However, their direct cross&#8208;coupling with fluoroalkyl electrophiles remains a formidable challenge due to the easy formation of thermo&#8208;unstable fluoroalkyl lithium species during the reaction, which are prone to decomposition via rapid &#945;/&#946;&#8208;fluoride elimination. Here, we exploit heteroatom&#8208;stabilized allylic anions to harness the exceptional reactivity of organolithium reagents, enabling the compatibility of difluoroalkyl halides and facilitating versatile and precise fluorine functionality introduction under mild conditions. In this process, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed difluoroalkylation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derived lithium reagents (N&#8208;stabilized allyl lithium reagents) with various difluoroalkyl bromides has been developed, opening a new avenue to access fluorinated compounds through catalytic cross&#8208;coupling of organolithium reagents with fluoroalkyl electrophiles. This approach allows for the efficient and precise construction of secondary C(sp3)&#8208;CF2R bonds, previously challenging in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed fluoroalkylation reactions due to &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. The rapid fluorine&#8208;editing of drugs demonstrates the synthetic versatility and utility of this protocol, showing the perspective in modern drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Azopyridine Polymers in Organic Phase Change Materials for High Energy Density Photothermal Storage and Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azo&#8208;compounds molecules and phase change materials offer potential applications for sustainable energy systems through the storage and controllable release photochemical and phase change energy. Developing novel and highly efficient Azo&#8208;based solar thermal fuels (STFs) for photothermal energy storage and synergistic cooperation with organic phase change materials present significant challenges. Herein, three types of (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) azopyridine polymers hinged with flexible alkyl chain are synthesized, in which meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer exhibits striking photothermal storage capacity of 430 J/g, providing a feasibility solution for developing high energy density Azo&#8208;based STFs. Furthermore, a stable two&#8208;phase hybrid system was innovatively constructed by combining the meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer with organic phase change materials leveraging hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to collectively harness phase change energy and photothermal energy. The organic phase change material not only supplies additional phase change latent heat but also serves as a solvent, offering abundant free volume for the photo&#8208;induced isomerization of the azopyridine chromophores, which successfully circumvents the low charging efficiency in the condensed state and reliance on solvent&#8208;assisted charging in traditional Azo&#8208;based STFs. This study demonstrates the energy distribution and utilization for household consumers and the photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategy, achieving more extensive potential implementation for STFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterizations of Dibenzo&#8208;Fused Perioctacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dibenzoperioctacene (DBPO) with extended zigzag edges was synthesized and unambiguously characterized by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) NMR analysis indicated the closed&#8208;shell character of DBPO, yet an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal was observed at room temperature suggesting its potential open&#8208;shell diradicaloid nature. The bond lengths in the single&#8208;crystal structure of DBPO aligned more closely with those of open&#8208;shell teranthene than closed&#8208;shell bisanthene. Spin&#8208;unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using various methods supported that ground state of DBPO might be on the borderline between closed&#8208; and open&#8208;shell singlet states, with a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), consistent with the VT&#8208;NMR and EPR results. UV&#8208;vis&#8208;near infrared (NIR) absorption spectrum showed the longest&#8208;wavelength peak at 905 nm, marking the NIR optical properties of DBPO. DBPO exhibited a tendency to react with atmospheric oxygen, which additionally hinted at its possible open&#8208;shell character. Furthermore, the oxidized species of non&#8208;fluorescent DBPO exhibited strong emission at 820 and 915 nm, which opens its potential for oxygen detection via a "turn&#8208;on" NIR fluorescence response.</dc:description>

Variable-temperature (VT) NMR analysis indicated the closed-shell character of DBPO, yet an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal was observed at room temperature suggesting its potential open-shell diradicaloid nature. The bond lengths in the single-crystal structure of DBPO aligned more closely with those of open-shell teranthene than closed-shell bisanthene. Spin-unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using various methods supported that ground state of DBPO might be on the borderline between closed- and open-shell singlet states, with a large singlet-triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), consistent with the VT-NMR and EPR results. UV-vis-near infrared (NIR) absorption spectrum showed the longest-wavelength peak at 905 nm, marking the NIR optical properties of DBPO. DBPO exhibited a tendency to react with atmospheric oxygen, which additionally hinted at its possible open-shell character. Furthermore, the oxidized species of non-fluorescent DBPO exhibited strong emission at 820 and 915 nm, which opens its potential for oxygen detection via a "turn-on" NIR fluorescence response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds Through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Opening/Isomerization of Densely Substituted Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a highly diastereoselective protocol for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds from densely substituted cyclopropanols. The methodology involves a palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring opening reaction followed by a &#8220;metal&#8208;walk&#8221; and oxidation of a remote hydroxyl group. The methodology represents a new application of cyclopropanols as initiation sites for chain walking remote functionalization. Importantly, this approach provides a straightforward access to highly valuable succinaldehyde derivatives bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters as single diastereomers.</dc:description>
