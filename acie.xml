         <title>Highly Ordered Inverse Opal Structures Synthesized from Shape&#8208;Controlled Nanocrystal Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack&#8208;free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO  2  ) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc&#8208;doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO  2  IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO  2  nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack&#8208;free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The intermolecular asymmetric radical oxidative C(sp  3  )&#8211;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling of C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds with easily available terminal alkynes is a promising tool to forge chiral C(sp  3  )&#8211;C(sp) bond due to the high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy and remains underexplored. Here, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp  3  )&#8211;C(sp) cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)benzylic and (cyclic)allylic C&#8211;H bonds with terminal alkynes in high to excellent enantioselectivity. Critical to the success is the rational design of chiral oxazoline&#8208;derived N,N,P(O)&#8208;ligands for not only tolerating the strong oxidative conditions which is requisite for intermolecular hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) process but also inducing the challenging enantiocontrol. Direct access to a range of synthetically useful chiral benzylic alkynes and 1,4&#8208;enynes, high site&#8208;selectivity among similar C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds, facile synthesis of enantioenriched   medicinally&#8208;relevant compounds make this approach very attractive.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensionality Control of Inorganic and Hybrid Perovskite Nanocrystals by Reaction Temperature: From No&#8208;Confinement to 3D and 1D Quantum Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work focuses on the systematic investigation of the shape, size, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) under inert gas&#8208;free conditions and using pre&#8208;synthesized precursor stock solutions. In the case of CsPbBr  3  NC, we find that the lowering of reaction temperature from ~175 to 100  o  C initially leads to a change of morphology from bulk&#8208;like 3D nanocubes to 0D nanocubes with 3D&#8208;quantum confinement, while at temperatures below 100  o  C the reaction yields 2D nanoplatelets (NPls) with 1D&#8208;quantum confinement. However, to our surprise, at higher temperatures (~215  o  C), the reaction yields CsPbBr  3  hexapod NCs, which have been rarely reported. The synthesis is scalable, and their halide composition is tunable by simply using different combinations of precursor solutions. The versatility of the synthesis is demonstrated by applying it to relatively less explored shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of FAPbBr  3  NCs. Despite the synthesis carried out in the air, both the inorganic and hybrid perovskite NCs exhibit nearly&#8208;narrow emission without applying any size&#8208;selective separation, and it is precisely tunable by controlling the reaction temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective catalytic Frustrated Lewis Pair Hydrogenation of CO2 in the Presence of Silylhalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The FLP derived from 2,6&#8208;lutidine and B(C  6  F  5  )  3  is shown to mediate the catalytic hydrogenation of CO  2  using H  2  as the reductant and a silylhalide as an oxophile. The nature of the products can be controlled with the judicious selection of the silylhalide and the solvent. In this fashion, this metal&#8208;free catalysis affords avenues to the selective formation of the disilylacetal (R  3  SiOCH  2  OSiR  3  ), methoxysilane (R  3  SiOCH  3  ), methyliodide (CH  3  I) and methane (CH  4  ) under mild conditions. DFT studies illuminate the complexities of the mechanism and account for the observed selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Ratio&#8208;Dependent Chemodivergent Asymmetric Synthesis</title>

A chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis can be achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system.







Abstract
Chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis was achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system. Using N&#8208;(aroyloxy)phthalimide as the precursor of either an oxygen&#8208;centered aroyloxy radical or a nitrogen&#8208;centered phthalimidyl radical, enantioselective oxocyanation or aminocyanation of alkenes was achieved separately through a dual photoredox and copper catalysis. The metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio can exert chemoselective control while retaining the high enantiopurity of divergent products. Both reactions proceed efficiently with catalyst loading as low as 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% and can be performed on a gram scale without loss of chemoselectivity or enantioselectivity. Chemodivergent asymmetric 1,5&#8208;aminocyanation or 1,5&#8208;oxocyanation of vinylcyclopropane can also be realized by this protocol. Mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed to shed light on the stereochemical and chemodivergent results.

         <title>Automated Electrical Quantification of Vitamin&#8197;B1 in a Bodily Fluid using an Engineered Nanopore Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22849-22855, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantification of small molecules in biological samples is challenging. Using the concentration&#8208;dependent current fluctuations elicited by a thiamine binding protein inside a ClyA nanopore, we show the automated quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute. By swapping the internal biosensor, this principle can be applied for the development of multiple next&#8208;generation home&#8208;diagnostic small&#8208;molecule sensors.







Abstract
The ability to measure the concentration of metabolites in biological samples is important, both in the clinic and for home diagnostics. Here we present a nanopore&#8208;based biosensor and automated data analysis for quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute, without the need for recalibration. For this we use the Cytolysin A nanopore and equip it with an engineered periplasmic thiamine binding protein (TbpA). To allow fast measurements we tuned the affinity of TbpA for thiamine by redesigning the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the thiazole group of thiamine and TbpA. This substitution resulted furthermore in a marked difference between unbound and bound state, allowing the reliable discrimination of thiamine from its two phosphorylated forms by residual current only. Using an array of nanopores, this will allow the quantification within seconds, paving the way for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule metabolite detection systems.

&lt;p&gt;Quantification of small molecules in biological samples is challenging. Using the concentration-dependent current fluctuations elicited by a thiamine binding protein inside a ClyA nanopore, we show the automated quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute. By swapping the internal biosensor, this principle can be applied for the development of multiple next-generation home-diagnostic small-molecule sensors.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reclaiming Inactive Lithium with a Triiodide/Iodide Redox Couple for Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22990-22995, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) redox couple is introduced with a SnI4 initiator to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I3&#8722; converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, and the oxidation of LiI by a delithiated cathode realizes the restoration of Li ion in cathode from inactive Li. The regenerated I3&#8722; by oxidation engages the further redox reactions.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries suffer from a short lifespan owing to apparently ceaseless inactive Li accumulation, which is accompanied by the consumption of electrolyte and active Li reservoir, seriously deteriorating the cyclability of batteries. Herein, a triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) redox couple initiated by stannic iodide (SnI4) is demonstrated to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I3&#8722; converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, which then diffuses to the cathode side. The oxidation of LiI by the delithiated cathode transforms cathode into the lithiation state and regenerates I3&#8722;, reclaiming Li ion from inactive Li. The regenerated I3&#8722; engages the further redox reactions. Furthermore, the formation of Sn mitigates the corrosion of I3&#8722; on active Li reservoir sacrificially. In working Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries, the accumulated inactive Li is significantly reclaimed by the reversible I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox couple, improving the lifespan of batteries by twice. This work initiates a creative solution to reclaim inactive Li for prolonging the lifespan of practical Li metal batteries.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22933-22939, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together. A built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is thus formed, which triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved.







Abstract
A built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO3&#8722; ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO3RR). A model electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed . This built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also raises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower the energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved, which are all the best among studies reported at 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of nitrate concentration to date.

         <title>The Voltage Dependent Sidedness of the Reprotonation of the Retinal Schiff Base Determines the Unique Inward Pumping of Xenorhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 23010-23017, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique behaviour of inward proton pumping xenorhodopsins (XeR) makes these microbial rhodopsins an alternative optogenetic tool to the passively transporting light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. channelrhodopsin&#8208;1 and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. Here, we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).







Abstract
The new class of microbial rhodopsins, called xenorhodopsins (XeRs),[1] extends the versatility of this family by inward H+ pumps.[2&#8211;4] These pumps are an alternative optogenetic tool to the light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. ChR1,2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. In this work we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).[1] The photodynamic behavior of NsXeR was investigated on the ps to s time scale elucidating the formation of the J and K and a previously unknown long&#8208;lived intermediate. The pH dependent kinetics reveal that alkalization of the surrounding medium accelerates the photocycle and the pump turnover. In patch&#8208;clamp experiments the blue&#8208;light illumination of NsXeR in the M state shows a potential&#8208;dependent vectoriality of the photocurrent transients, suggesting a variable accessibility of reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base. Insights on the kinetically independent switching mechanism could furthermore be obtained by mutational studies on the putative intracellular H+ acceptor D220.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Over Bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ Sites</title>

A Rhn cluster cocatalyst with Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 delivers a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity, which benefits from a bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction mechanism, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites aided by hydrogen atom transfer to adjacent Rh0 sites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting provides an economically feasible way for converting solar energy into hydrogen. Great efforts have been devoted to developing efficient photocatalysts; however, the surface catalytic reactions, especially for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), still remain a challenge, which limits the overall photocatalytic energy efficiency. Herein, we design a Rhn cluster cocatalyst, with Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites anchoring the Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 model photocatalytic system. The resultant photocatalyst enables a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity of 7.11&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 29.37&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. The turnover frequency (TOF) achieves 416.73&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is 378 times higher than that of the photocatalyst only with Rh3+ species. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption characterization shows the OER process on the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites. The DFT calculations further illustrate a bifunctional OER mechanism over the Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ sites, in which the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites with assistance of a hydrogen atom transfer to the Rh0 sites, thus breaking the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Functionalized Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a fluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) was developed to suppress Li dendrite growth by realizing both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number. Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone reduce the mobility of Li salt anion and decrease the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains.







Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li) is regarded as the ideal anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its low electrochemical potential, highest theoretical energy density and low density. There are, however, still significant challenges to be addressed such as Li&#8208;dendrite growth and low interfacial stability, which impede the practical application of Li metal anodes. In order to circumvent these shortcomings, herein, we present a gel polymer electrolyte containing imidazolium ionic liquid end groups with a perfluorinated alkyl chain (F&#8208;IL) to achieve both high ionic conductivity and Li ion transference number by fundamentally altering the solubility of salt within the gel electrolyte through Lewis&#8208;acidic segments in the polymer backbone. Moreover, the presence of F&#8208;IL moieties decreased the binding affinity of Li cation towards the glycol chains, enabling a rapid transfer of Li cation within the gel network. These structural features enabled the immobilization of anions on the ionic liquid segments to alleviate the space&#8208;charge effect while promoting stronger anion coordination and weaker cation coordination in the Lewis&#8208;acidic polymers. Accordingly, we realized a high Li ion conductivity (9.16&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high Li ion transference number of 0.69 simultaneously, along with a good electrochemical stability up to 4.55&#8197;V, while effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte exhibited stable cycling performance of the Li|Li symmetric cell of 9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 1800&#8197;hours and retained 86.7&#8201;% of the original capacity after 250&#8197;cycles for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) full cell.

The bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)lithium cation, the lightest main&#8208;group metal analogue of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)Cr, was prepared and characterized in the solid state.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)lithium cation, the benzene metallocene of the lightest metal, is reported. The boron compound FmesBCl2 [Fmes: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] reacted with three molar equivalents of the lithio&#8208;acetylene reagent Li&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Fmxyl [Fmxyl: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]. Subsequent crystallization from benzene gave the [bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)Li]+ cation with the [{FmesB(&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Fmxyl)3}2Li]&#8722; anion. This parent [(arene)2Li]+ cation shows an eclipsed arrangement of the pair of benzene ligands at the central lithium cation with uniform carbon&#8208;lithium bond lengths. The corresponding [(&#951;6&#8208;toluene)2Li]+ and [(&#951;6&#8208;durene)2Li]+ containing salts were similarly prepared. The bis(arene)lithium cations were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by solid&#8208;state 7Li MAS NMR spectroscopy and their bonding features were analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Basic EDTA as a Highly Active Molecular Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotubes has been identified as active catalyst for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4. A high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6&#8201;% for CH4 production is observed.







Abstract
The most active catalysts so far successful in hydrogenation reduction of CO2 are mainly heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The complex coordination environments and multiple active sites in heterogeneous catalysts result in low selectivity of target product, while molecular catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites and tailorable structures allow mechanism&#8208;based performance optimization. Herein, we firstly report a single ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) molecular&#8208;level immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotube as a catalyst for transferring CO2 to CH4 with an excellent performance. This catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6&#8201;% toward CH4, a partial current density of &#8722;16.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a potential of &#8722;1.3&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Lewis basic COO&#8722; groups in EDTA molecule are the active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The energy barrier for the generation of CO from *CO intermediate is as high as 0.52&#8197;eV, while the further protonation of *CO to *CHO follows an energetic downhill path (&#8722;1.57&#8197;eV), resulting in the high selectivity of CH4. This work makes it possible to control the product selectivity for CO2RR according to the relationship between the energy barrier of *CO intermediate and molecular structures in the future.

Mapping of the atomic strain on high&#8208;index facet transition&#8208;metal nanoparticles is conducted to investigate the underlying correlation between the enhanced surface reactivity and the structural properties. Essential parameters are proposed to describe the surface features and predict the surface reactivity, examined by adsorption energy calculations of CO2RR key intermediates.







Abstract
Although high&#8208;index facets (HIF) endows excellent catalytic activity through undercoordinated sites with strain effect, current characterizations techniques still cannot unravel the detailed strain distributions to understand the origins of electroactivity. Nevertheless, theoretical principles to quantify the structural features and their effects on catalytic activity improvements on HIFs are still lacking, which renders the experimental efforts laborious. In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late&#8208;transition metal HIF nanoparticle models. The surface reactivities of the nanoparticles have been examined by adsorption energy calculations and their correlations with structural features are observed. Our proposed theoretical principles on surface characterizations of high&#8208;index facets nanomaterials will promote the design and synthesis of efficient transition metal based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Practical Chemoselective Acylation: Organocatalytic Chemodivergent Esterification and Amidation of Amino Alcohols with N&#8208;Carbonylimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22818-22825, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemoselective esterification or aniline amidation of polyfunctional molecules is possible by a catalytic chemodivergent protocol involving only simple reagents: N&#8208;acylimidazoles and either DBU or pyridinium ion (see scheme). These reactions may be performed in the simultaneous presence of phenols, indoles, amides, some aliphatic amines, and other groups. A mechanism&#8208;based model for predicting the acylation chemoselectivity is provided.







Abstract
Chemoselective transformations are a cornerstone of efficient organic synthesis; however, achieving this goal for even simple transformations, such as acylation reactions, is often a challenge. We report that N&#8208;carbonylimidazoles enable catalytic chemodivergent aniline or alcohol acylation in the presence of pyridinium ions or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU), respectively. Both acylation reactions display high and broad chemoselectivity for the target group. Unprecedented levels of chemoselectivity were observed in the DBU&#8208;catalyzed esterification: A single esterification product was obtained from a molecule containing primary aniline, alcohol, phenol, secondary amide, and N&#8722;H indole groups. These acylation reactions are highly practical as they involve only readily available, inexpensive, and relatively safe reagents; can be performed on a multigram scale; and can be used on carboxylic acids directly by in situ formation of the acylimidazole electrophile.

         <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of a Reactive [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;OH)2]2+ Intermediate in Cu/TEMPO Catalyzed Aerobic Alcohol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 23018-23024, October 11, 2021. </description>

A dinuclear CuI complex 1 activates O2 to form a bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species, which can efficiently couple O2 reduction and the oxidation of alcohols to make 1/TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) a suitable catalyst system for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. Notably, 1/TEMPO ensures a clean reduction of O2 to H2O, in contrast to (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)CuI/TEMPO, where the generation of H2O2 is proposed.







Abstract
CuI/TEMPO (TEMPO=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) catalyst systems are versatile catalysts for aerobic alcohol oxidation reactions to selectively yield aldehydes. However, several aspects of the mechanism are yet unresolved, mainly because of the lack of identification of any reactive intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a dinuclear [L12Cu2]2+ complex 1, which in presence of TEMPO can couple the catalytic 4&#8201;H+/4&#8201;e&#8722; reduction of O2 to water to the oxidation of benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The mechanisms of the O2&#8208;reduction and alcohol oxidation reactions have been clarified by the spectroscopic detection of the reactive intermediates in the gas and condensed phases, as well as by kinetic studies on each step in the catalytic cycles. Bis(&#956;&#8208;oxo)dicopper(III) (2) and bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)dicopper(II) species 3 are shown as viable reactants in oxidation catalysis. The present study provides deep mechanistic insight into the aerobic oxidation of alcohols that should serve as a valuable foundation for ongoing efforts dedicated towards the understanding of transition&#8208;metal catalysts involving redox&#8208;active organic cocatalysts.

         <title>Phosphorized CoNi2S4 Yolk&#8208;Shell Spheres for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Production via Water and Urea Electrolysis</title>

Phosphorus&#8208;substituted CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) have been rationally designed and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation and subsequent gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. The desired hollow structure and multielement composition with abundant Ni3+ active sites endow P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs with high electrocatalytic activity and robust stability towards electrochemical hydrogen production via water splitting and urea electrolysis.







Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Porous phosphorized CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) were rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni3+/Ni2+ couple, enhanced electronic conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8722;0.135&#8197;V, 1.512&#8197;V, and 1.306&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544&#8197;V in water splitting and 1.402&#8197;V in urea electrolysis to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent durability for 100&#8197;h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production and provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.

         <title>Platinum Modulates Redox Properties and 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22908-22914, October 11, 2021. </description>

Pt is proven to be an effective accelerator to Ni(OH)2 for catalyzing HMF oxidation reaction. Pt optimizes the surface electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 and accelerates the formation of the active Ni(OH)O species. Besides, it optimizes the adsorption mode of HMF and reduces the adsorption energy.







Abstract
Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)2 is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)2 electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)2 electrode.

&lt;p&gt;Pt is proven to be an effective accelerator to Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for catalyzing HMF oxidation reaction. Pt optimizes the surface electronic structure of Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and accelerates the formation of the active Ni(OH)O species. Besides, it optimizes the adsorption mode of HMF and reduces the adsorption energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel-based catalyst for HMF electro-oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni-based catalysts such as Ni(HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescent Behavior Elucidation of a Disilane&#8208;Bridged D&#8211;A&#8211;D Triad Composed of Phenothiazine and Thienopyrazine</title>

A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane comprising a thienopyrazine group as acceptor fragment and a phenothiazine group as donor moiety was prepared. The compound exhibits fluorescence in the solid state upon UV excitation and mechanochromic luminescent properties.







Abstract
A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8722;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8722;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.

A nitrogen&#8208;anchored low&#8208;valence Zn single&#8208;atom catalyst, containing coordinately unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 active sites, can boost electrochemical CO2 reduction to industrial application levels.







Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;atom catalyst containing low&#8208;valence zinc atoms (Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC) is reported. It contains saturated four&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N4) and unsaturated three&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N3) sites. The latter makes Zn a low&#8208;valence state, as deduced from X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and density functional theory. Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC catalyzes electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with near&#8208;unity selectivity in water at an overpotential as low as 310&#8197;mV. A current density up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved together with high CO selectivity of &gt;95&#8201;% using Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC in a flow cell. Calculations suggest that the unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 could dramatically reduce the energy barrier by stabilizing the COOH* intermediate owing to the electron&#8208;rich environment of Zn. This work sheds light on the relationship among coordination number, valence state, and catalytic performance and achieves high current densities relevant for industrial applications.

Redox&#8208;active heptafluoroisopropoxylating reagents were conveniently prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines, and then were successfully used for the synthesis of a series of alkyl(aryl) heptafluoroisopropyl ethers.







Abstract
The heptafluoroisopropyl group (CF(CF3)2) is prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. However, heptafluoroisopropoxylated (OCF(CF3)2) compounds remain largely underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient access to these compounds. Herein, we disclose the practical and efficient heptafluoroisopropoxylation reactions through the invention of a series of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. These reagents were readily prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines with AgCF(CF3)2. The substitutions on the nitrogen atom significantly affected the properties and reactivities of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. Accordingly, two types of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents including N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 phthalimide A and N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 benzotriazolium salt O&#8242; were used as OCF(CF3)2 anion and radical precursors, respectively. This protocol enables the direct heptafluoroisopropoxylation of a range of substrates, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Oxygen Interaction: A Crystal Engineering Tool for Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22797-22803, October 11, 2021. </description>

Experimental evidence for the azide&#8208;oxygen noncovalent interaction in dictating the conformation of molecules having these functional groups in vicinity is provided. 36 Crystal structures of designed compounds were analyzed. Additionally, a CSD search revealed the frequent occurrence of this interaction in reported crystal structures. This interaction might find use in designing supramolecular architectures and in crystal engineering.







Abstract
We have designed, synthesized, and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#946; contact. Geometry&#8208;optimized structures [using M06&#8208;2X/6&#8211;311G(d,p) level of theory] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this is not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader's Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI&#8208;RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems.

     alt="Azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Oxygen Interaction: A Crystal Engineering Tool for Conformational Locking"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimental evidence for the azide-oxygen noncovalent interaction in dictating the conformation of molecules having these functional groups in vicinity is provided. 36 Crystal structures of designed compounds were analyzed. Additionally, a CSD search revealed the frequent occurrence of this interaction in reported crystal structures. This interaction might find use in designing supramolecular architectures and in crystal engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have designed, synthesized, and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&lt;sub&gt;&#946;&lt;/sub&gt; contact. Geometry-optimized structures [using M06-2X/6&#8211;311G(d,p) level of theory] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this is not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader's Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI-RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems. NBO analysis suggested a weak orbital-relaxation (charge-transfer) contribution of energy for a few &lt;sub&gt;(sp2)&lt;/sub&gt;O-donor systems. Natural population analysis (NPA) and molecular electrostatic potential mapping (MESP) of these crystal structures further revealed the existence of favorable azide-oxygen interaction. A CSD search indicated the frequent and consistent occurrence of this interaction and its role dictating the syn conformation of azide and oxygen in molecules where these groups are separated by 2&#8211;4 bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Phase Separation into Coupled Interfaces for Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Formate over a Wide Potential Window</title>

Cu2SnS3 evolved into the strongly coupled heterogeneous interfaces of SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O under reaction conditions. This strongly coupled heterojunction as real active sites drives the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thus promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Thus, Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
Bimetallic sulfides are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate over a wide potential window, however, they will undergo in situ structural evolution under the reaction conditions. Therefore, clarifying the structural evolution process, the real active site and the catalytic mechanism is significant. Here, taking Cu2SnS3 as an example, we unveiled that Cu2SnS3 occurred self&#8208;adapted phase separation toward forming the stable SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O heterojunction during the electrochemical process. Calculations illustrated that the strongly coupled interfaces as real active sites driven the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thereby promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of ternary sulfides under the CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Various Stacking Patterns of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Cocrystals: Insight into Competitive Intermolecular Interactions and Control of Stacking Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22839-22848, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of the stacking patterns of molecular two&#8208;dimensional layers in a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystals by a chemical modification is demonstrated. The effect of the chemical modification is discussed in terms of both the enthalpic and entropic contributions based on experimental and computational results.







Abstract
Control over the stacking patterns in 2D molecular assemblies is demonstrated using chemical modification. A target system is a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystal (2:1) composed of 2&#8208;pyrrolidone (Py) and chloranilic acid (CA) (PyCA). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that weak intersheet interactions give rise to a variety of metastable overlapping patterns comprised of the 2D assemblies mainly formed via hydrogen bonds, affording reversible and irreversible structural phase transitions. We prepared cocrystals of Py and anilic acids bearing different halogens, in which 2D assemblies isostructural with those observed in PyCA exhibit various overlapping patterns. The order of stability for each overlapping pattern estimated using calculations of the intermolecular interactions did not completely coincide with those indicated by our experimental results, which can be explained by considering the entropic effect: the molecular motion of Py as detected using nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy.

Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles while retaining the integrity and biological functions of RNA was reported. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000 nucleotides can be used.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;directed biomolecule crosslinking in nature has been used for synthesizing various biopolymers, including DNA, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. However, the RNA biopolymer has been avoided so far, as due to the poor stability of the RNA molecules, the formation of a biopolymer may alter the biological function of the molecules. Herein, for the first time, we report Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles while retaining the integrity and biological function of RNA. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000 nucleotides were used, highlighting the versatility of this approach. The assembled nanospheres possess a superior RNA&#8208;loading efficiency, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability. In&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo evaluation demonstrated mRNA delivery for expressing GFP proteins, and microRNA delivery to triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. This coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly behavior amplifies the horizons of RNA coordination chemistry and the application scope of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Dithiane/Iodofluorobenzene Mixtures: A New Class of Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22983-22989, October 11, 2021. </description>

By combining 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), the first halogen bonding&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent is reported. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic point of 13.7&#8201;&#176;C, over a wide compositional range. The other combinations of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
While research into deep eutectic solvents (DESs) has expanded over the previous two decades, the focus has remained on the utilization of hydrogen bond donors in these systems. Additionally, the majority of the known DESs rely on at least one ionic component. Through the combination of 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), we report the first known DES based on halogen bonding. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic melting temperature of 13.7&#8201;&#176;C over a range of 1,3&#8208;dithiane mole fraction (0.35 to 0.75). Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85&lt;RXB&lt;0.99; RXB=normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.

Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3- and 1,4-dithiane with 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;DIB, as well as 1,3,5-trifluoro-2,4,6-triiodobenzene were studied via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;XB&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;0.99; &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;XB&lt;/sub&gt;=normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observability of Paramagnetic NMR Signals at over 10&#8201;000 ppm Chemical Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22856-22864, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution paramagnetic NMR resonances of a ferrous complex with an intermediate spin ground state with chemical shifts beyond ten thousand ppm were detected, the observability of which are attributed to a large rhombic zero&#8208;field splitting resulting in an effective suppression of the dipolar relaxation mechanism.







Abstract
We report an experimental observation of 31P&#8197;NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000&#8197;ppm (meaning percent range, and a new record for solutions), and similar 1H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [tBu(PNP)Fe&#8208;H], where PNP is a carbazole&#8208;based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (T1 &#8776;10&#8722;11&#8197;s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.

         <title>An Improved Turn Structure for Inducing &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Formation in Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22776-22782, October 11, 2021. </description>

&#948;&#8208;Linked &#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (&#948;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides.







Abstract
Although &#946;&#8208;hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is no tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that &#948;&#8208;linked &#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (&#948;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides. We developed a synthesis of protected &#948;MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with l&#8208;leucine and affords gram quantities of the N&#945;&#8208;Boc&#8208;N&#948;&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;&#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine building block. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms that the &#948;MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopy allow comparison of the &#948;MeOrn turn template to the &#948;&#8208;linked ornithine (&#948;Orn) turn template that we previously introduced and to the popular d&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly turn template. These studies show that the folding of the &#948;MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of &#948;Orn and is comparable to d&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly.

         <title>Surface Density Dependent Catalytic Activity of Single Palladium Atoms Supported on Ceria**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22769-22775, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on CeO2 deviate from the assumption of constant specific activity as a function of Pd loading. CO oxidation activity increases as more Pd is loaded, but once nanoparticles form, dramatic deactivation is observed. Pd supported on Al2O3 does not exhibit this phenomenon, demonstrating that the reducibility of the support is an important factor.







Abstract
The analogy between single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and molecular catalysts predicts that the specific catalytic activity of these systems is constant. We provide evidence that this prediction is not necessarily true. As a case in point, we show that the specific activity over ceria&#8208;supported single Pd atoms linearly increases with metal atom density, originating from the cumulative enhancement of CeO2 reducibility. The long&#8208;range electrostatic footprints (&#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) around each Pd site overlap with each other as surface Pd density increases, resulting in an observed deviation from constant specific activity. These cooperative effects exhaust previously active O atoms above a certain Pd density, leading to their permanent removal and a consequent drop in reaction rate. The findings of our combined experimental and computational study show that the specific catalytic activity of reducible oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts can be tuned by varying the surface density of single metal atoms.

The lack of stable reference electrodes (REs) for electrochemical measurements in small cell arrangements is an often&#8208;neglected problem. Herein we present an easily applicable procedure for the assembly of stable and cheap micro&#8208;REs, which are highly adaptable due to 3D&#8208;printed housings; 3 aqueous and 3 non&#8208;aqueous micro&#8208;REs based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na. After fabrication, their stability and leak&#8208;tightness are shown by electrochemical measurements.







Abstract
While numerous reference electrodes suitable for aqueous electrolytes exist, there is no well&#8208;defined standard for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, reference electrodes are often large and do not meet the size requirements for small cells. In this work, we present a simple method for fabricating stable 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;reference electrodes. The prints are made from polyvinylidene fluoride, which is chemically inert in strong acids, bases, and commonly used non&#8208;aqueous solvents. We chose six different reference systems based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na, including three aqueous and three non&#8208;aqueous systems to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. Subsequently, we conducted cyclic voltammetry experiments and measured the potential difference between the aqueous homemade reference electrodes and a commercial Ag/AgCl&#8208;electrode. For the non&#8208;aqueous reference electrodes, we chose the ferrocene redox couple as an internal standard. From these measurements, we deduced that this new class of micro&#8208;reference electrodes is leak&#8208;tight and shows a stable electrode potential.

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;Assisted Triphase Photocatalysis Over a Multifunctional Bilayer Paper</title>

A scalable TiO2/C bilayer paper for photothermal&#8208;assisted photocatalytic phenol oxidation is reported. The triphase interface ensures the fast supply of oxygen reactant at high photon flux, whilst the photothermal effect promotes the subsequent phenol free radical reaction kinetics. Cycling stability, sunlight feasibility, oxygen concentration compatibility and flow condition demonstrate the possibility for large&#8208;scale photocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Photocatalysis as one of the future environment technologies has been investigated for decades. Despite great efforts in catalyst engineering, the widely used powder dispersion and photoelectrode systems are still restricted by sluggish interfacial mass transfer and chemical processes. Here we develop a scalable bilayer paper from commercialized TiO2 and carbon nanomaterials, self&#8208;supported at gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid interfaces for photothermal&#8208;assisted triphase photocatalysis. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species can be facilitated through fast oxygen diffusion over triphase interfaces, while the interfacial photothermal effect promotes the following free radical reaction for advanced oxidation of phenol. Under full spectrum irradiation, the triphase system shows 13 times higher reaction rate than diphase controlled system, achieving 88.4&#8201;% mineralization of high concentration phenol within 90&#8197;min full spectrum irradiation. The bilayer paper also exhibits high stability over 40 times cycling experiments and sunlight driven feasibility, showing potentials for large scale photocatalytic applications by being further integrated into a triphase flow reactor.

         <title>Segmented Polyurethanes and Thermoplastic Elastomers from Elemental Sulfur with Enhanced Thermomechanical Properties and Flame Retardancy</title>

From petroleum refining to thermoplastic elastomers and flame retardants: We report on a new synthetic method to prepare segmented polyurethanes and thermoplastic elastomers from elemental sulfur which have improved thermomechanical properties and flame retardancy.







Abstract
The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high&#8208;performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi&#8208;block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S8 with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods, a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and microscopic imaging. These sulfur&#8208;based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8211;24&#8197;MPa) and ductility (348&#8201;% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578&#8201;% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Arylbenzylation of Alkenylarenes: Kinetic Studies Reveal Autocatalysis by ZnX2**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22977-22982, October 11, 2021. </description>

We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylbenzylation reaction of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents to furnish 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures, the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. Kinetic studies and competition experiments reveal that the reaction is autocatalyzed by ZnX2 by activating benzyl halides, potentially by a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction with the halide, which increases the catalytic rate by a factor of three.







Abstract
We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective arylbenzylation of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents. The reaction furnishes differently substituted 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures that are reminiscent of the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds with a rate&#8208;limiting single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process and is autocatalyzed by in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated ZnX2. The reaction rate is amplified by a factor of three through autocatalysis upon addition of ZnX2.

         <title>A New Dioxazolone for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Aminoalcohols via Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22948-22955, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A safe and bench&#8208;stable dioxazolone reagent was developed for the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in tertiary and secondary alcohol&#8208;based substrates. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary and secondary C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Vicinal aminoalcohols are widespread structural motifs in bioactive molecules. We report the development of a new dioxazolone reagent containing a p&#8208;nitrophenyldifluoromethyl group, which 1. displays a good safety profile; 2. shows a remarkably high reactivity in the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds; 3. leads to amide products which can be hydrolyzed under mild conditions. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary C&#8722;H bonds of tertiary and secondary alcohols, as well as secondary C&#8722;H bonds of cyclic secondary alcohols. This method provides an easy access to free 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols after efficient and mild cleavage of the oxime directing group and activated amide.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Synthetic Growth Factor Surrogates with Fine&#8208;Tuned Agonism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22745-22752, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists that elicit a desired signal activity is reported. Synthetic growth factor surrogates showing fine&#8208;tuned agonism were developed by exploiting the programmability of DNA aptamer. These DNA&#8208;based agonists can be used to regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting moderate receptor signaling.







Abstract
Designing synthetic surrogates of functional proteins is an important, albeit challenging, task in the field of chemistry. A strategy toward the design of synthetic agonists for growth factor or cytokine receptors that elicit a desired signal activity has been in high demand, as such ligands hold great promise as safer and more effective therapeutics. In the present study, we used a DNA aptamer as a building block and described the strategy&#8208;guided design of a synthetic receptor agonist with fine&#8208;tuned agonism. The developed synthetic partial agonist can regulate therapeutically relevant cellular activities by eliciting fine&#8208;tuned receptor signaling.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Nonenzymatic Template&#8208;Directed RNA Synthesis</title>

We combine X&#8208;ray crystallography and kinetic measurements of modified nucleic acid constructs to determine the requirements for efficient template copying. The 3E conformation of the furanose rings is preferred in the formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Our findings may explain why RNA is a privileged substrate amongst other plausible candidates.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a 3E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.

         <title>Towards Data&#8208;Driven Design of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins: Database and Hierarchical Learning</title>

A standardized database including over 12000 literature transformations was created to provide the data basis for the AI design of asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins. The developed hierarchical learning strategy can provide a predictive model in the early stage of catalysis screening where limited data is available.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most powerful asymmetric transformations in molecular synthesis. Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data&#8208;driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few&#8208;shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening.

         <title>Stabilizing the Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase with Polyacrylamide for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22812-22817, October 11, 2021. </description>

Polyacrylamide (PAM) was introduced to &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI) to realize the formation of an effective solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) in LiMn2O4&#8741;L&#8208;TiO2 full cells by lowering the cathodic limit in the electrochemical stability window (ESW) and suppressing the hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The introduction of &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (WiSE) concept opens a new horizon to aqueous electrochemistry that is benefited from the formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, such SEI still faces multiple challenges, including dissolution, mechanical damaging, and incessant reforming, which result in poor cycling stability. Here, we report a polymeric additive, polyacrylamide (PAM) that effectively stabilizes the interphase in WiSE. With the addition of 5 molar % PAM to 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI electrolyte, a LiMn2O4&#8741;L&#8208;TiO2 full cell exhibits enhanced cycling stability with 86&#8201;% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C. The formation mechanism and evolution of PAM&#8208;assisted SEI was investigated using operando small angle neutron scattering and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal that PAM minimizes the presence of free water molecules at the anode/electrolyte interface, accelerates the TFSI&#8722; anion decomposition, and densifies the SEI.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Catalytic Deracemization of Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22833-22838, October 11, 2021. </description>

Deracemization is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but it is challenging owing to thermodynamic and kinetic barriers. Here we describe a method for deracemization of alcohols based on tandem photochemical dehydrogenation and thermal enantioselective hydrogenation, using light as the only driving force.







Abstract
Deracemization of racemic chiral compounds is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but its development has been hindered by energetic and kinetic challenges. Here we describe a catalytic deracemization method for secondary benzylic alcohols which are important synthetic intermediates and end products for many industries. Driven by visible light only, this method is based on sequential photochemical dehydrogenation followed by enantioselective thermal hydrogenation. The combination of a heterogeneous dehydrogenation photocatalyst and a chiral molecular hydrogenation catalyst is essential to ensure two distinct pathways for the forward and reverse reactions. These reactions convert a large number of racemic aryl alkyl alcohols into their enantiomerically enriched forms in good yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Interpenetration Symmetry Control Within Ultramicroporous Robust Boron Cluster Hybrid MOFs for Benchmark Purification of Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22865-22870, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented symmetrically interpenetrated boron cluster pillared MOF was prepared to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation with large C2H2 capacity (76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 selectivity (56.6), modestly high adsorption heat (54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and high practical C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;% purity) productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) owing to the precise control of interpenetration symmetry.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade&#8208;off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. We report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU&#8208;1, for benchmark selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 with a high C2H2 capacity of 76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and record C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 56.6 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modeling indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C2H2 trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of 99.5&#8201;% purity C2H2 during stepped desorption process.

&lt;p&gt;The separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade-off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. We report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU-1, for benchmark selective separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity of 76.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and record C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 56.6 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modeling indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of 99.5&#8201;% purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during stepped desorption process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction is one of the most powerful methods for allylic oxidation of alkenes. However, the inherent radical mechanism and use of peroxides as both oxidants and oxygen nucleophiles render dearth of universal catalytic systems for highly enantioselective variants and limited scope. Herein, an alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Detailed mechanistic studies provide evidences for the radical&#8208;based reaction pathway.

O&#8208;PTIR spectroscopy applied to the analysis of the organic composition of samples from historical paintings is presented for the first time.







Abstract
Optical&#8208;photothermal infrared (O&#8208;PTIR) spectroscopy is a recently developed technique that provides spectra comparable to traditional transmission FTIR spectroscopy with nanometric spatial resolution. Hence, O&#8208;PTIR is a promising candidate for the analysis of historical paintings, as well as other cultural heritage objects, but its potential has not yet been evaluated. This work presents the first application of O&#8208;PTIR to the analysis of cultural heritage, and in particular to an extremely small fragment from Van Gogh's painting L&#8242;Arl&#233;sienne (portrait of Madame Ginoux). The striking results obtained, including the detection of geranium lake pigments as well as the complete analysis of the stratigraphy, failed with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, highlight the potential of this method. The integration of O&#8208;PTIR to the study of cultural heritage opens to the possibility of decreasing the amount of sample extracted, therefore contributing to the preservation of the integrity of artworks while providing a complete characterization of the materials.

N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A)&#8208;modified RNA analysis is limited at the bulk&#8208;population level, thus not giving access to spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information. In their Communication on page&#8197;22646, Jinghong Li et&#8197;al. propose a powerful in&#8197;situ imaging method, termed m6A&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA), that enables the identification of m6A modifications at a specific location in RNAs and the imaging of m6A RNA with single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule resolution.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Over Bifunctional Rh0&#8208;Rh3+ Sites (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42/2021)</title>

Bifunctional Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites anchored on Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 show a high visible&#8208;light photocatalytic oxygen production activity, as reported by Peng&#8197;Fei Liu, Zheng Jiang, Hua&#8197;Gui Yang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#160;22761. Operando XAFS results and DFT calculations illustrate the bifunctional OER mechanism on the Rh0&#8211;Rh3+ sites: the oxygen intermediate attacks the Rh3+ sites, facilitating a hydrogen atom transfer to the adjacent Rh0 sites, which synergistically optimizes the OER energetics.

         <title>Dinuclear Silver Complexes in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22614-22622, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of silver catalysis has seen tremendous growth over the past two decades, and dinuclear complexes are often proposed to facilitate silver&#8208;catalyzed transformations. In this Minireview, we survey and analyze the various roles of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis. We also highlight outstanding questions as well as areas for potential growth and development.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of synthetically useful transformations catalyzed by silver. Across the range of silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions that have been reported, dinuclear species often emerge as a common feature, either as the (pre&#8208;)catalysts themselves or as intermediates during catalysis. This Minireview explores the role of dinuclear silver complexes in homogeneous catalysis, which we hope will aid in the development of improved design principles for silver catalysts.

Dual&#8208;emission (DE) materials have found widespread use in the materials and life sciences. This systematic, tutorial Review offers a clear presentation of the phenomenon and highlights misinterpretations as well as further literature with the aim of promoting the further targeted development of DE materials.







Abstract
There has been much interest in dual&#8208;emission materials in the past few years for materials and life science applications; however, a systematic overview of the underlying processes is so&#8208;far missing. We resolve this issue herein by classifying dual&#8208;emission (DE) phenomena as relying on one emitter with two emitting states (DE1), two independent emitters (DE2), or two correlated emitters (DE3). Relevant DE mechanisms for materials science are then briefly described together with the electronic and/or geometrical conditions under which they occur. For further reading, references are given that offer detailed insight into the complex mechanistic aspects of the various DE processes or provide overviews on materials families or their applications. By avoiding ambiguities and misinterpretations, this systematic, insightful Review might inspire future targeted designs of DE materials.

The first enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features use of a dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin&#8197;A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode for biological evaluations.

         <title>Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)&#8208;Guided Peptide Engineering of an Aptamer Sensor for Protease&#8208;Triggered Molecular Imaging</title>

A method is proposed for the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer sensor by using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to bridge the gap between peptide and functional DNA. The protease&#8208;triggered biosensor enables ATP imaging with improved specificity for tumor cells.







Abstract
Protease&#8208;triggered control of functional DNA has remained unachieved, leaving a significant gap in activatable DNA biotechnology. Herein, we report the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer system that can perform molecular sensing and imaging in a tumor&#8208;specific manner. The system is constructed by locking the structure&#8208;switching activity of an aptamer using a rationally designed PNA&#8211;peptide&#8211;PNA triblock copolymer. Highly selective protease&#8208;mediated cleavage of the peptide substrate results in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequent recovery of its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system allows for tumor cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging in&#8197;vitro and also produces a fluorescent signal in&#8197;vivo with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA and peptides for precise biomedical applications.

         <title>Media&#8208;Driven Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Cascades with 1,3&#8208;Diynamides Leading Selectively to Either Indoles or Quinolines</title>

Which coast to take? Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with 1,3&#8208;diynamides and primary or secondary amines result by adding or omitting TBAF. In the absence of TBAF 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles are formed, whereas the addition of TBAF leads selectively to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. The latter pathway involves the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides.







Abstract
Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with various 1,3&#8208;diynamides yielding either 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles or 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines were established. Omitting or adding TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) to the reaction of N,N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodophenyl)(4&#8208;toluenesulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynamides with secondary or primary amines in the presence of KOH in THF and catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3)4 completely changed the outcome of the reaction. In the absence of TBAF, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles were the sole products, while the presence of TBAF switched the product formation to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. Deuterium labeling proceeded selectively at the C3 and C11 positions of the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinoline products and this suggests the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides as reactive key intermediates.

         <title>Insights into the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes through Multispectral Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22672-22677, October 11, 2021. </description>

A multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations is used to obtain new insights into the ionic conduction mechanism, the nature of the solvent molecules, and the interactions among different components in quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix, and solvent, are beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions between different components of QPE remain unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. The Li cations in gel polymer electrolyte are fully solvated by partial solvent molecules to form a local high concentration of Li+, while the other solvent molecules are fastened by polymer matrix in QPE. As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li+ are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and will promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>A Selection of Macrocyclic Peptides That Bind STING From an mRNA&#8208;Display Library With Split Degenerate Codons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22640-22645, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;vitro selection of macrocyclic peptides from a library that uses a 25&#8208;amino&#8208;acid alphabet has allowed the identification of peptides that block binding of human STING to its natural ligand and induce dimerization of STING monomers. Our method splits multiple degenerate codons and reassigns them to non&#8208;natural amino acids.







Abstract
Recent improvements in mRNA display have enabled the selection of peptides that incorporate non&#8208;natural amino acids, thus expanding the chemical diversity of macrocycles beyond what is accessible in nature. Such libraries have incorporated non&#8208;natural amino acids at the expense of natural amino acids by reassigning their codons. Here we report an alternative approach to expanded amino&#8208;acid diversity that preserves all 19 natural amino acids (no methionine) and adds 6 non&#8208;natural amino acids, resulting in the highest sequence complexity reported to date. We have applied mRNA display to this 25&#8208;letter library to select functional macrocycles that bind human STING, a protein involved in immunoregulation. The resulting STING&#8208;binding peptides include a 9&#8208;mer macrocycle with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.4&#8197;nM, which blocks binding of cGAMP to STING and induces STING dimerization. This approach is generalizable to expanding the amino&#8208;acid alphabet in a library beyond 25 building blocks.

         <title>Catalysis with Supramolecular Carbon&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>

Supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis was established as a new platform for organic synthesis. A class of versatile catalysts was discovered which showed catalytic capability in different benchmark reactions, thus demonstrating the wide potential of this catalysis strategy.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centers of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Small Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silica Nanoparticles</title>

Evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of a bioconjugate is reported. The formation of ring&#8208;like structures was independent of different silica particle types and the amount of peptide conjugated to the material. This novel approach paves the way for further production of functional materials for separation, catalysis, and medical applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly processes guide disordered molecules or particles into long&#8208;range organized structures due to specific supramolecular interactions among the building entities. Herein, we report a unique evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) strategy for four different silica nanoparticle systems obtained through peptide functionalization of the particle surface. First, covalent peptide&#8208;silica coupling was investigated in detail, starting with the grafting of a single amino acid (L&#8208;serine) and expanded to specific small peptides (up to four amino acids) and transferred to different particle types (MCM&#8208;48&#8208;type MSNs, solid nanoparticles, and newly developed virus&#8208;like nanoparticles). These materials were investigated regarding their ability to undergo EISA, which was shown to be independent of particle type and amount of peptide anchored to their surface. This EISA&#8208;based approach provides new possibilities for the design of future advanced drug delivery systems, engineered hierarchical sorbents, and nanocatalyst assemblies.

Scissions of sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in an imidazole&#8208;based dithione dimer by stable Lewis bases have been investigated. While NHSi gives a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene complex, both CAAC and NHC provide unusual carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L0) zwitterions.







Abstract
A series of reactions between Lewis bases and an imidazole&#8208;based dithione dimer (1) has been investigated. Both cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) (2) and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) (4), in addition to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi) (6), demonstrate the capability to cleave the sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in 1, giving carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L0) zwitterions (3 and 5) and a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene compound (7), respectively. The bonding nature of 3, 5, and 7 are probed by both experimental and theoretical methods.

         <title>Controlling Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis Activities in Lead&#8208;Free Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 Perovskites via Ion Substitution</title>

A series of Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 perovskites with high water stability demonstrate switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions on variation of the amount of platinum. With low platinum contents, the photocatalytic function is activated and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is achieved in water, whereas with high platinum contents the photoluminescence function is achieved.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have triggered interest in the field of optoelectronics and photocatalysis because of their low toxicity, and tunable optical and charge&#8208;carrier properties. From an application point of view, it is desirable to develop stable multifunctional lead&#8208;free halide perovskites. We have developed a series of Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 perovskites (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with high stability, which show switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions by varying the amount of Pt4+ substitution. A Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 solid solution with a dominant proportion of Pt4+ shows broadband photoluminescence with a lifetime on the microsecond timescale. A Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 solid solution with a small amount of Pt4+ substitution exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. An optical spectroscopy study reveals that the switch between photoluminescence and photocatalysis functions is controlled by sub&#8208;band gap states. Our finding provides a new way to develop lead&#8208;free multifunctional halide perovskites with high stability.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Nickel&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22740-22744, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both theoretical simulations and in&#8197;situ experiments demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode and improves the seawater oxidation stability.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and in situ experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion. The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ca. 5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.

The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly-active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ca. 5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of S.&#8197;aureus Infection of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) by Trehalose&#8208; and Glucose&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</title>

Due to increased resistance against antibiotics, the fight against bacteria is becoming increasingly difficult. Here, we used a sugar that is unique to the bacteria metabolism, trehalose, and prepared trehalose&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to inhibit the infection of healthy cells by S.&#8197;aureus and could serve as a non&#8208;toxic alternative to prevent adhesion of certain bacteria.







Abstract
Microbial adhesion to host cells represents the initial step in the infection process. Several methods have been explored to inhibit microbial adhesion including the use of glycopolymers based on mannose, galactose, sialic acid and glucose. These sugar receptors are, however, abundant in the body, and are not unique to bacteria. Trehalose, in contrast, is a unique disaccharide that is widely expressed by microbes. This carbohydrate has not yet been explored as an anti&#8208;adhesive agent. Herein, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with trehalose&#8208;based polymers were prepared and compared to glucose&#8208;functionalized AuNPs and examined for their ability to prevent binding to endothelial cells. Acting as anti&#8208;adhesive agents, trehalose&#8208;functionalized NPs decreased the binding of S.&#8197;aureus to HUVECs, while outperforming the control NPs. Microscopy revealed that trehalose&#8208;coated NPs bound strongly to S.&#8197;aureus compared to the controls. In conclusion, nanoparticles based on trehalose could be a non&#8208;toxic alternative to inhibit S.&#8197;aureus infection.

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

Compressive strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites could boost the catalytic activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites with 1.5&#8201;% compressed Fe&#8722;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.

Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations have been limited to the aziridination of C=C double bonds. In this study, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed oxaziridination of C=O double bonds and achieved a tandem asymmetric oxaziridination/rearrangement reaction of cyclic diketones, affording a series of bicyclic lactams bearing a quaternary carbon center.







Abstract
Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.

&#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular derivatives of pinacol (Bpin), are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors, generating &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals from H2 in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst. These radicals undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations onto appropriate double bonds, eventually furnishing densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals can be stabilized by delocalization of their spin density into the vacant p orbital of a boron substituent. &#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular pinacol (Bpin) derivatives, are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors. Under H2, in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst, they generate &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals; these species can undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations if appropriate double bond acceptors are present, leading to densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance with wide scope, and the resulting boronate products can be converted into other useful functionalities.

         <title>2D Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Multidimensional Photocatalysts for Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22664-22671, October 11, 2021. </description>

2D porphyrinic nanosheets were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts to mediate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization of different monomers under a broad range of light wavelengths. This system exhibits oxygen tolerance and temporal control resulting in the preparation of well&#8208;defined polymers. Nanosheets were utilized to catalyze stereolithographic 3D printing, providing reinforced mechanical properties and effective antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
Ultrathin porphyrinic 2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets (TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light.

The 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were applied as photocatalysts in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects.

&lt;p&gt;2D porphyrinic nanosheets were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts to mediate PET-RAFT polymerization of different monomers under a broad range of light wavelengths. This system exhibits oxygen tolerance and temporal control resulting in the preparation of well-defined polymers. Nanosheets were utilized to catalyze stereolithographic 3D printing, providing reinforced mechanical properties and effective antimicrobial activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin porphyrinic 2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets (TCPP: 5,10,15,20-(tetra-4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate PET-RAFT polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were achieved. The polymers showed narrow molecular weight distributions and good chain-end fidelity. The 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were applied as photocatalysts in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open-air environment under blue light to yield well-defined 3D printed objects. Apart from providing an efficient catalytic system, 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials.

         <title>Stable Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22683-22687, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by an anion receptor was proposed for the construction of a stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The introduction of an anion receptor decreases the reduction stability of FSI&#8722; and increases the amount of FSI&#8722; in the form of AGG&#8208;II. The decomposition of FSI&#8722; to form Li2S is promoted, improving the stability of the anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries are severely hindered by the dendritic Li deposition dictated by non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Despite its unique advantages in improving the uniformity of Li deposition, the current anion&#8208;derived SEI is unsatisfactory under practical conditions. Herein regulating the electrolyte structure of anions by anion receptors was proposed to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB) anion acceptors with electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms interact with bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anions (FSI&#8722;) and decrease the reduction stability of FSI&#8722;. Furthermore, the type of aggregate cluster of FSI&#8722; in electrolyte changes, FSI&#8722; interacting with more Li ions in the presence of TPFPB. Therefore, the decomposition of FSI&#8722; to form Li2S is promoted, improving the stability of anion&#8208;derived SEI. In working Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries under practical conditions, the anion&#8208;derived SEI with TPFPB undergoes 194 cycles compared with 98&#8197;cycles of routine anion&#8208;derived SEI. This work inspires a fresh ground to construct stable anion&#8208;derived SEI by manipulating the electrolyte structure of anions.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Imaging of m6A Modified RNA Using m6A&#8208;Specific In Situ Hybridization Mediated Proximity Ligation Assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA)</title>

We design a m6A&#8208;specific in situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA) for in situ visualization of m6A modified RNA (m6A RNA) in single cells. This technique shows excellent recognition specificity of m6A modification at specific location in mRNA and in situ visualization ability of single&#8208;molecule resolution.







Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification&#8212;the most prevalent mammalian RNA internal modification&#8212;plays key regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism. Current approaches for m6A modified RNA analysis limit at bulk&#8208;population level, resulting in a loss of spatiotemporal and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell variability information. Here we proposed a m6A&#8208;specific in situ hybridization mediated proximity ligation assay (m6AISH&#8208;PLA) for cellular imaging of m6A RNA, allowing to identify m6A modification at specific location in RNAs and image m6A RNA with single&#8208;cell and single&#8208;molecule resolution. Using m6AISH&#8208;PLA, we investigated the m6A level and subcellular location of HSP70 RNA103&#8208;m6A in response to heat shock stress, and found an increased m6A modified ratio and an increased distribution ratio in cytoplasm under heat shock. m6AISH&#8208;PLA can serve in the study of m6A RNA in single cells for deciphering epitranscriptomic mechanisms and assisting clinical diagnosis.

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 42, Page 22711-22716, October 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond mediated supramolecular assembly with chiral fractal structure is demonstrated in axially chiral pyridine&#8208;based molecules and 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The assembly shows asymmetry amplification both in ground state and excited state, and the enhancement of the chirality can be assigned to the hierarchical chirality transfer from molecule to chiral fractal structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to their great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains unknown how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly via halogen bonds, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (F4DIB) and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometer scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatics Enabled by Regioselective Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic compounds with interesting geometry and useful properties (see picture) were synthesized by Scholl reactions, which enabled oxidative coupling of carbazole units in a regioselective manner. A nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
The synthesis of new carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatics with interesting geometry and useful properties was explored using Scholl reactions. As found from the Scholl reactions of substrates having two carbazole units linked at different positions through o&#8208;phenylene, oxidative coupling of carbazole units occurred in a regioselective manner with new carbon&#8211;carbon bonds preferably formed at C3 and C4 in N&#8208;alkyl carbazoles. A new N&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors.

         <title>trans Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Cleavage via CRISPR/Cas14a1 Activated by Target RNA without Destruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated detection platform (Amplification, Transcription, Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated trans ssDNA cleavage, ATCas&#8208;RNA) has an outstanding specificity for the detection of target RNAs with point mutation resolution, which is better than that of the Cas14a1&#8208;based ssDNA&#8208;activation.







Abstract
As a CRISPR&#8208;Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR associated proteins), Cas14a1 can cis/trans cleave single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). Here, we describe an unreported capacity of Cas14a1: RNA can trigger the trans ssDNA cleavage. This Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated detection platform (Amplification, Transcription, Cas14a1&#8208;based RNA&#8208;activated trans ssDNA cleavage, ATCas&#8208;RNA) has an outstanding specificity for the detection of target RNAs with point mutation resolution, which is better than that of the Cas14a1&#8208;based ssDNA&#8208;activation. Using ATCas&#8208;RNA via a fluorophore quencher&#8208;labeled ssDNA reporter (FQ), we were able to detect 1&#8197;aM pathogenic nucleic acid within 1&#8197;h, and achieve 100&#8201;% accuracy with 25 milk samples. This platform can serve as a new tool for high&#8208;efficiency nucleic acid diagnostics. Importantly, this work can expand our understanding of Cas14a1 and inspire further mechanisms and applications of Class&#8208;2 Cas systems.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 Antigen to Overcome the Hydrolytic Instability of O&#8208;Acetylated&#8208;GD2 for Anticancer Conjugate Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potential anticancer vaccine was produced by the conjugation of bacteriophage Q&#946; virus&#8208;like particle with the chemoenzymatically synthesized 9&#8208;NHAc&#8208;GD2 mimic of the 9&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated GD2 antigen. The conjugate produced robust and long&#8208;lasting IgG responses in mice and canines with no observed adverse effects.







Abstract
Ganglioside GD2 is an attractive tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen for anti&#8208;cancer vaccine development. However, its low immunogenicity and the significant side effects observed with anti&#8208;GD2 antibodies present significant obstacles for vaccines. To overcome these, a new GD2 derivative bearing an N&#8208;acetamide (NHAc) at its non&#8208;reducing end neuraminic acid (9NHAc&#8208;GD2) has been designed to mimic the 9&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated&#8208;GD2 (9OAc&#8208;GD2), a GD2 based antigen with a restricted expression on tumor cells. 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 was synthesized efficiently via a chemoenzymatic method and subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;9NHAc&#8208;GD2 conjugate elicited strong and long&#8208;lasting IgG antibodies, which were highly selective toward 9NHAc&#8208;GD2 with little cross&#8208;recognition of GD2. Immunization of canines with Q&#946;&#8208;9NHAc&#8208;GD2 showed the construct was immunogenic in canines with little adverse effects, paving the way for future clinical translation to humans.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Dimeric Aptamers Enable the Rapid Electrochemical Detection of Wild&#8208;Type and B.1.1.7 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Unprocessed Saliva</title>

         <dc:description>
Rapid and simple: an electrochemical sensor, based on a high&#8208;affinity dimeric DNA aptamer for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein was developed to detect the wildtype and Alpha and Delta variant in unprocessed saliva samples in 10&#8197;minutes, providing a detection limit of 1000&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1, clinical sensitivity of 80.5&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report a simple and rapid saliva&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antigen test that utilizes a newly developed dimeric DNA aptamer, denoted as DSA1N5, that specifically recognizes the spike proteins of the wildtype virus and its Alpha and Delta variants with dissociation constants of 120, 290 and 480&#8197;pM, respectively, and binds pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the wildtype and alpha trimeric spike proteins with affinity constants of 2.1&#8197;pM and 2.3&#8197;pM, respectively. To develop a highly sensitive test, DSA1N5 was immobilized onto gold electrodes to produce an electrochemical impedance sensor, which was capable of detecting 1000 viral particles per mL in 1:1 diluted saliva in under 10&#8197;min without any further sample processing. Evaluation of 36 positive and 37 negative patient saliva samples produced a clinical sensitivity of 80.5&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% and the sensor could detect the wildtype virus as well as the Alpha and Delta variants in the patient samples, which is the first reported rapid test that can detect any emerging variant of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Engineering Fluorophore Recycling in a Fluorogenic RNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorogenic RNA aptamers bind to and activate the fluorescence of otherwise nonfluorescent dyes. Here we show an approach to maximize their fluorescence by reducing the impact of photobleaching. We engineered TBI, a fluorophore that rapidly dissociates upon photobleaching and can be rapidly replaced by TBI in the media. By maximizing &#8220;fluorophore recycling&#8221;, we achieve higher fluorescence and enable long&#8208;term fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Fluorogenic aptamers can potentially show minimal photobleaching during continuous irradiation since any photobleached fluorophore can exchange with fluorescent dyes in the media. However, fluorophores have not been designed to maximize &#8220;fluorophore recycling.&#8221; Here we describe TBI, a novel fluorophore for the Broccoli fluorogenic aptamer. Previous fluorophores either fail to rapidly dissociate when they undergo photobleaching via cis&#8211;trans isomerization, or bind slowly, resulting in extended periods after dissociation of the photobleached fluorophore when no fluorophore is bound. By contrast, photobleached TBI dissociates rapidly from Broccoli, and TBI from the media rapidly replaces dissociated photobleached fluorophore. Using TBI, Broccoli exhibits markedly enhanced fluorescence in cells during continuous imaging. These data show that designing fluorophores to optimize fluorophore recycling can lead to enhanced fluorescence of fluorogenic aptamers.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Enhanced Antimicrobial Activity of Polymers Containing an Embedded Photosensitiser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding a photosensitiser monomer within antimicrobial polymer formulations provides two distinct mechanisms of antibacterial activity for a broader spectrum of action.







Abstract
This work presents the synthesis of a novel photosensitive acrylate monomer for use as both a self&#8208;catalyst in the photoinduced electron/energy transfer&#8211;reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation process and a photosensitiser (PS) for antibacterial applications. Hydrophilic, cationic, and antimicrobial formulations are explored to compare the antibacterial effects between charged and non&#8208;charged polymers. Covalent attachment of the catalyst to well&#8208;defined linear polymer chains has no effect on polymerisation control or singlet oxygen generation. The addition of the PS to polymers provides activity against S.&#8197;aureus for all polymer formulations, resulting in up to a 99.99999&#8201;% killing efficacy in 30&#8197;min. Antimicrobial peptide mimetic polymers previously active against P.&#8197;aeruginosa, but not S.&#8197;aureus, gain significant bactericidal activity against S.&#8197;aureus through the inclusion of PS groups, with 99.998&#8201;% killing efficiency after 30&#8197;min incubation with light. Thus, a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity is achieved using two distinct mechanisms of bactericidal activity via the incorporation of a photosensitiser monomer into an antimicrobial polymer.

         <title>Fused Bithiophene Imide Dimer&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers bearing hydrophilic branched methyl end&#8208;capped glycol side chains were developed, showing a high degree of backbone planarity, favorable polymer chain packing orientation, and substantial electrochemical doping efficiency. As a result, the f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) deliver a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 4.60&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind their p&#8208;type counterparts. In order to address this dilemma, we report here two new fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymers with a branched methyl end&#8208;capped glycol side chain, which exhibit good solubility, low&#8208;lying LUMO energy levels, favorable polymer chain orientation, and efficient ion transport property, thus yielding a remarkable OECT electron mobility (&#956;e) of up to &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and volumetric capacitance (C*) as high as 443&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3, simultaneously. As a result, the f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT&#8208;based OECTs deliver a record&#8208;high maximum geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 4.60&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum &#956;C* product of 15.2&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The &#956;C* figure of merit is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type OECTs. The emergence of f&#8208;BTI2TEG&#8208;FT brings a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for low&#8208;power OECT applications.

Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) multicolor heterostructures have shown great potential for achieving anti&#8208;counterfeit applications. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109336), Zhenhua Gao, Xiangeng Meng, Yong&#8197;Sheng Zhao et&#8197;al. have developed a strategy to construct 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs heterostructures. The domain&#8208;controlled emissive colors in these 2D lateral Ln&#8208;MOFs epitaxial heterostructures allow for definition of 2D photonic barcodes, which could be used for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like a music box, in nanopore single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprinting a rotating metal cylinder (an analyte) uses perfectly placed pins (the chemical groups of an analyte) that come up under the comb (the characteristic residue inside the nanopore inner wall) to strike the appropriate prongs or tines of that comb (confined interactions). In this way, each analyte generates a characteristic fingerprint frequency as it undergoes the confined interactions with the nanopore, as explained by Yi&#8208;Lun Ying, Yi&#8208;Tao Long et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108226).

         <title>Defying Thermodynamics: Stabilization of Alane Within Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cluster of alane (AlH3) stabilized by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of a bipyridine&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework, CTF&#8208;bipy, is shown on the cover image. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107507), Mark&#8197;D. Allendorf et&#8197;al. demonstrate how the resulting AlH3@CTF&#8208;bipy material releases hydrogen at temperatures as low as 95&#8201;&#176;C with full decomposition at 250&#8201;&#176;C. The hydride can be regenerated at 60&#8201;&#176;C under 700&#8197;bar hydrogen, a pressure which is more than an order of magnitude lower compared to that required to hydrogenate bulk aluminum.

         <title>Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of proton transport within nonionic reverse micelles is dependent on the proton concentration ([H+]) and the size of the nanoconfined environment. For small reverse micelles and/or low [H+], protons diffuse via the Grotthuss mechanism (forward hopping). In larger reverse micelles and/or at high [H+], ions accumulate at the reverse micelles interface, resulting in a proton &#8220;traffic jam,&#8221; in which an oscillatory hopping mechanism becomes dominant.







Abstract
The properties of the water network in concentrated HCl acid pools in nanometer&#8208;sized reverse nonionic micelles were probed with TeraHertz absorption, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, and reactive force field simulations capable of describing proton hopping mechanisms. We identify that only at a critical micelle size of W0=9 do solvated proton complexes form in the water pool, accompanied by a change in mechanism from Grotthuss forward shuttling to one that favors local oscillatory hopping. This is due to a preference for H+ and Cl&#8722; ions to adsorb to the micelle interface, together with an acid concentration effect that causes a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which the short&#8208;circuiting of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif of the hydronium ion decreases the forward hopping rate throughout the water interior even as the micelle size increases. These findings have implications for atmospheric chemistry, biochemical and biophysical environments, and energy materials, as transport of protons vital to these processes can be suppressed due to confinement, aggregation, and/or concentration.

         <title>Genetically Engineered Polypeptide Adhesive Coacervates for Surgical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;swelling protein&#8208;based coacervate adhesives for in&#8197;vivo applications were fabricated by employing electrostatic complexation of supercharged polypeptides (SUPs) and oppositely charged surfactants. The adhesives exhibited superior performance compared to other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives. The outstanding adhesion performance, good biocompatibility, and biodegradability of SUP adhesives facilitate fast wound healing and skin regeneration.







Abstract
Adhesive hydrogels have been developed for wound healing applications. However, their adhesive performance is impaired dramatically due to their high swelling on wet tissues. To tackle this challenge, we fabricated a new type of non&#8208;swelling protein adhesive for underwater and in&#8197;vivo applications. In this soft material, the electrostatic complexation between supercharged polypeptides with oppositely charged surfactants containing 3,4&#8208;dihydroxylphenylalanine or azobenzene moieties plays an important role for the formation of ultra&#8208;strong adhesive coacervates. Remarkably, the adhesion capability is superior to commercial cyanoacrylate when tested in ambient conditions. Moreover, the adhesion is stronger than other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives in underwater environment. The ex vivo and in vivo experiments demonstrate the persistent adhesive performance and outstanding behaviors for wound sealing and healing.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Divergent Construction of (Dihydro)thiophenes with DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a redox&#8208;divergent construction of dihydrothiophenes, thiophenes, and bromothiophenes from readily available allylic alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and HBr, respectively. This strategy can serve for the programmable and concise synthesis of bioactive and functional molecules.







Abstract
Thiophene&#8208;based rings are one of the most widely used building blocks for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Inspired by the redox diversity of these features in nature, we demonstrate herein a redox&#8208;divergent construction of dihydrothiophenes, thiophenes, and bromothiophenes from the respective readily available allylic alcohols, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and HBr. The redox&#8208;divergent selectivity could be manipulated mainly by controlling the dosage of DMSO and HBr. Mechanistic studies suggest that DMSO simultaneously acts as an oxidant and a sulfur donor. The synthetic potentials of the products as platform molecules were also demonstrated by various derivatizations, including the preparation of bioactive and functional molecules.

         <title>Influence of Intracrystalline Ionic Strength in MFI Zeolites on Aqueous Phase Dehydration of Methylcyclohexanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary alcohols, which follow either an E1 or an E2 elimination pathway were investigated by Eszter Bar&#225;th, Johannes&#8197;A. Lercher et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107947). It is known that water forms clusters within the zeolite channels, however its effect on the intrinsic mechanism of the dehydration needs to be fundamentally understood. It was found that the volcano shape and position of the maximum in the dehydration of methylcyclohexanols in aqueous phase over various MFI zeolite catalysts is a consequence of the intracrystalline ionic strength and a spatial constraint.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) integrated with MoS2 nanosheets is fabricated in the Communication by Xu Jing, Chunying Duan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108892). The composite is effective for the photocatalytic conversion of gas&#8208;phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH and O2 under visible light irradiation. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interface between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2 play the key role for achieving high selectivity for C2 production.

&lt;p&gt;A hierarchically porous defective UiO-66 (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-UiO-66) integrated with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets is fabricated in the Communication by Xu Jing, Chunying Duan et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202108892"&gt;10.1002/anie.202108892&lt;/a&gt;). The composite is effective for the photocatalytic conversion of gas-phase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light irradiation. The Mo-O-Zr bimetallic sites on the interface between UiO-66 and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; play the key role for achieving high selectivity for C2 production.

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulin secretion from &#946;&#8208;cells in intact islets can now be recorded together with calcium signal and organelles. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109510), Zhixing Chen and co&#8208;workers developed a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal materials with broadband optical absorption and high conversion efficiency are intensively pursued to date. Here, proposing by the  d&#8208;d  interband transitions, we report an unprecedented high&#8208;entropy alloy FeCoNiTiVCrCu nanoparticles that the energy regions below and above the Fermi level (&#177;4 eV) have been fully filled by the 3  d  transition metals, which realizes an average absorbance greater than 96% in the entire solar spectrum (wavelength of 250 to 2500 nm). Furthermore, we also calculated the photothermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation rate towards the steam generation. Due to its pronounced full light capture and ultrafast local heating, our high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle&#8208;based solar steam generator has over 98% efficiency under one sun irradiation, meanwhile enabling a high evaporation rate of 2.26 kg m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental observation of hydrocarbon growth by resonance stabilized radical&#8208;radical chain reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid molecular weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8208;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C  6  H  5  ) and benzyl (c&#8208;C  6  H  5  CH  2  ) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8208;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8208;1600 K) and low pressure (~3 kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>ROS/RNS and Base Dual Activatable Merocyanine&#8208;Based NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Molecular Probe for in vivo Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammation usually results in high&#8208;level reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) not only in acidic tissue but also in alkaline tissue. However, noninvasively  in vivo  monitoring reactive species specifically within alkaline tissue remains a huge challenge. Here we introduce a dual activatable fluorescent probe PN910 located in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 900&#8208;1700 nm), which shows high selectivity toward H  2  O  2  and OONO  &#8208;  at pH beyond 7.4. Then we verified that PN910 could be used for the real&#8208;time, specific and accurate monitoring of cystitis and colitis for living animals. This report presents a unique approach to the development of dual activatable probe for  in vivo  biosensing.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanofluidic devices have been widely used for diode&#8208;like ion transport and salinity gradients energy conversion. Emerging reverse electrodialysis (RED) nanofluidic systems based on nanochannel membrane display great superiority in salinity gradient energy harvesting. However, the imbalance between permeability and selectivity limits their practical application. Here, we fabricate a new mesoporous carbon&#8208;silica/anodized aluminum (MCS/AAO) nanofluidic device with enhanced permselectivity for temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated energy generation. A maximum power density of 5.04 W/m2 is achieved, and a higher performance can be obtained by regulating temperature and pH. Theoretical calculations are further implemented to reveal the mechanism for ion rectification, ion selectivity and energy conversion. Results show that the MCS/AAO hybrid membrane has great superiority in diode&#8208;like ion transport, temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;regulated salinity gradient energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hindrance of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode via Surface Gradient Penetration of Tantalum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, they still suffer from poor rate capability and low specific capacity due to the severe kinetic hindrance at the nondilute state during Li  +&#160;  intercalation. Herein, combining experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that this obstacle can be tackled by regulating the oxidation state of nickel via injecting high&#8208;valence foreign Ta  5+  . The as&#8208;obtained single&#8208;crystalline LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  delivers a high specific capacity (211.2 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C), high initial Coulombic efficiency (93.8%), excellent rate capability (157 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 4 C), and good durability (90.4% after 100 cycles under 0.5 C). This work provides a strategy to mitigate the Li  +  kinetic hindrance of the appealing single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathodes and will inspire peers to conduct an intensive study.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrophosphination&#160;of a&#8208;Bromoenals to Prepare Phosphine&#8208;Containing Chiral Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed herein is the first carbene&#8208;organocatalyzed asymmetric addition of phosphine nucleophiles to the in situ generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates. Our reaction enantioselectively constructs carbon&#8208;phosphine bonds and prepares chiral phosphines  with high optical purities. The phosphine products are suitable for transforming to chiral ligands or catalysts with applications in asymmetric catalysis. The diarylalkyl or trialkyl phosphine products from our catalytic reactions, air&#8208;sensitive and reactive in nature, can be trapped (and stored) in their sulfur&#8208;oxidized form for operational simplicities.</dc:description>

         <title>Fire&#8208;retardant, stable&#8208;cycling and high&#8208;safety sodium ion battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt; 85% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7%).</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;ion intercalation and high volumetric capacitance in a two&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;porous coordination polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intercalation is a promising ion sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to electrochemical surface area. It requires rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material and it must occur without phase transformation. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do, intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni  3  (benzenehexathiol) (Ni  3  BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni  3  BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using diazonaphthoquinones and anilines as key reagents and through a point&#8208;to&#8208;axis chiral transfer strategy, the atroposelective synthesis via asymmetric C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bond insertion reaction of arenes has been realized under rhodium catalysis, providing the resulting biaryl atropisomers in moderate to excellent yields with good enantiomeric ratios (up to 99:1). Further elaboration indicates this type of axially biaryl scaffold may have promising potentials in developing novel chiral ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine as a reagent for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. In this report we introduce&#160;S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the&#160;production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from&#160;S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of&#160;small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;component Reaction to 1,4,2&#8208;Diazaborole&#8208;type Heteroarene Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borane FmesBH  2  reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivative with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Five&#8208;coordinate Compound with Inverted Ligand Field: An Unprecedented Geometry for Silver(III)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By using suitable synthetic procedures, we have first isolated the square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) compounds [PPh  4  ][  trans  &#8208;(CF  3  )  2  AgX  2  ] [X&#160;= Cl (  1a  ), Br (  2a  )]. The geometry and stereochemistry of the chloro&#8208;derivative  1a  have been unambiguously established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) methods. Following our calculations on the relative stability of the  cis  &#8208;/  trans  &#8208;[(CF  3  )  2  AgX  2  ]  &#8722;  couples (X&#160;= F, Cl, Br, I), the experimentally obtained compounds  1a  and  2a  appear to be kinetically favoured stereoisomers. They display some tendency to associate an additional X  &#8722;  ligand affording rare five&#8208;coordinate Ag(III) species [(CF  3  )  2  AgX  3  ]  2&#8722;  . Interestingly, compound [PPh  4  ]  2  [(CF  3  )  2  AgBr  3  ] (  3  ) has been identified by SC&#8208;XRD methods as the first Ag(III) derivative with trigonal symmetry in general and trigonal bipyramidal geometry in particular.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By using suitable synthetic procedures, we have first isolated the square-planar organosilver(III) compounds [PPh  4  ][  trans  -(CF  3  )  2  AgX  2  ] [X&#160;= Cl (  1a  ), Br (  2a  )]. The geometry and stereochemistry of the chloro-derivative  1a  have been unambiguously established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) methods. Following our calculations on the relative stability of the  cis  -/  trans  -[(CF  3  )  2  AgX  2  ]  &#8722;  couples (X&#160;= F, Cl, Br, I), the experimentally obtained compounds  1a  and  2a  appear to be kinetically favoured stereoisomers. They display some tendency to associate an additional X  &#8722;  ligand affording rare five-coordinate Ag(III) species [(CF  3  )  2  AgX  3  ]  2&#8722;  . Interestingly, compound [PPh  4  ]  2  [(CF  3  )  2  AgBr  3  ] (  3  ) has been identified by SC-XRD methods as the first Ag(III) derivative with trigonal symmetry in general and trigonal bipyramidal geometry in particular.

         <title>Multiphase Microreactors Based on Liquid&#8211;Liquid and Gas&#8211;Liquid Dispersions Stabilized by Colloidal Catalytic Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent progress in liquid&#8211;liquid and gas&#8211;liquid dispersions stabilized by solid surface&#8208;active colloidal particles (emulsions, foams, bubbles, marbles, bijels) as microreactors. These new systems constitute original platforms for reengineering multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability.







Abstract
Pickering emulsions, foams, bubbles, and marbles are dispersions of two immiscible liquids or of a liquid and a gas stabilized by surface&#8208;active colloidal particles. These systems can be used for engineering liquid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid microreactors for multiphase reactions. They constitute original platforms for reengineering multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability. This Review provides a systematic overview on the recent progress of liquid&#8211;liquid and gas&#8211;liquid dispersions stabilized by solid particles as microreactors for engineering eco&#8208;efficient reactions, with emphasis on biobased reagents. Physicochemical driving parameters, challenges, and strategies to (de)stabilize dispersions for product recovery/catalyst recycling are discussed. Advanced concepts such as cascade and continuous flow reactions, compartmentalization of incompatible reagents, and multiscale computational methods for accelerating particle discovery are also addressed.

         <title>Functional Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a New Class of Heterogeneous Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Donor Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an artificial halogen&#8208;bonding pocket can serve as an efficient heterogeneous halogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donor catalyst for the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Biomimetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks have attracted great attention as they can be used as bio&#8208;inspired models, allowing us to gain important insights into how large biological molecules function as catalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis and utilization of such a metal&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework (MMPF) that is constructed from a custom&#8208;designed ligand as an efficient halogen bond donor catalyst for Diels&#8211;Alder reactions under ambient conditions. The implementation of fabricated halogen bonding capsule as binding pocket with high&#8208;density C&#8722;Br bonds enabled the use of halogen bonding to facilitate organic transformations in their three&#8208;dimensional cavities. Through combined experimental and computational studies, we showed that the substrate molecules diffuse through the pores of the MMPF, establishing a host&#8208;guest system via the C&#8722;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. The formation of halogen bonds is a plausible explanation for the observed boosted catalytic efficiency in Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. Moreover, the unique capability of MMPF highlights new opportunities in using artificial non&#8208;covalent binding pockets as highly tunable and selective catalytic materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Chemical Assembly in Living Cells by Integration of Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis and Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The idea of using a molecular brake in materials science to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells is introduced. A tyrosine protection strategy enables the enzymatic cleavage site to be unmasked selectively by hydrolysis in the acidic environment of the lysosome. Cleavage of the P&#8722;N bond releases phosphotyrosine and enables enzyme&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly inside living cells spatiotemporally.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of chemical assembly in living cells remains challenging. We have now developed an efficient and general platform to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells. We introduced an O&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)phosphono]tyrosine protection strategy in the self&#8208;assembly motif as the Trojan horse, whereby the programmed precursors resist hydrolysis by phosphatases on and inside cells because the unmasking of the enzymatic cleavage site occurs selectively in the acidic environment of lysosomes. After demonstrating the multistage self&#8208;assembly processes in&#8197;vitro by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS), cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM), and circular dichroism (CD), we investigated the formation of site&#8208;specific self&#8208;assembly in living cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), LC&#8208;MS, and biological electron microscopy (Bio&#8208;EM). Controlling chemical assembly in living systems spatiotemporally may have applications in supramolecular chemistry, materials science, synthetic biology, and chemical biology.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Fungal Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpene Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the complete elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters from Aspergillus calidoustus, including the first identified fungal drimenol cyclase. The cluster&#8208;associated acyltransferase is then employed to transfer different lengths of ACP&#8208;activated polyketides, but also very diverse CoA&#8208;esters.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters isolated from Aspergillus calidoustus and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster&#8208;associated cytochrome P450 and FAD&#8208;binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturation. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.

         <title>Unraveling Hydrocarbon Pool Boosted Propane Aromatization on Gallium/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrocarbon pool process is revealed in propane aromatization over Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Cyclopentenyl cations are observed and determined as active intermediates in propane conversion by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The formation of cyclopentenyl cations initiates autocatalysis of propane to aromatics in the induction period. The aromatization process is promoted by hydride transfer between propane and cyclopentenyl cations.







Abstract
Propane aromatization on metal&#8208;modified zeolites provides a promising route to produce valuable chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylene via non&#8208;petroleum feedstocks. The mechanistic understanding of propane conversion to aromatics is still challenging due to the complexity of the aromatization process. Herein, by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS, it is shown that cyclopentenyl cations are formed as active intermediates during propane aromatization on Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Autocatalysis of propane to aromatics is identified in the induction period. The cyclopentenyl cations serve as key hydrocarbon pool species to co&#8208;catalyze propane conversion and promote aromatics formation, revealing a dominant hydrocarbon pool process in propane aromatization.

         <title>Identifying Reactive Sites and Surface Traps in Chalcopyrite Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroelectrochemical and computational methods are combined to shed light on the promising reactivity of semiconductor chalcopyrites towards hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. A direct correlation between the PEC response and the chemical nature of the catalytic interface is presented, providing guidelines for engineering the performance of chalcopyrites.







Abstract
Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2. We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In, and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite's performance and its surface's chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial for achieving high activity.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,2&#8208;Difluorotetrahydrofurans through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates was achieved with a broad substrate scope, low catalyst loading, good yields, and excellent enantioselectivities. The enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans were transformed to novel gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic compounds.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans was accomplished via enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition catalyzed by palladium. The asymmetric reaction between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and racemic vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates resulted in the formation of enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorotetrahydrofurans with an enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. Notably, the reaction used the readily available (R)&#8208;BINAP as the ligand at a low loading and yielded a wide variety of difluorinated products in moderate to high yields. Both chiral diastereomers could be obtained in a single sequence.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation for the Reductive Cyclisation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones towards Trisubstituted Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InBr3 is used as functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation from &#947;&#8208;terpinene as H2 surrogate to initiate the cyclisation of 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted enones to trisubstituted furans in good yields. Design of Experiments was used to optimise the reaction conditions with a few experiments to almost quantitative yields and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments gave valuable mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;&#8208;terpinene, to enones, which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan&#8211;indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent. In addition, a site&#8208;specific deuterium labelling of the dihydroaromatic HD surrogates resulted in site specific labelling of the products and gave useful insights into the reaction mechanism by H&#8211;D scrambling.

         <title>What Makes High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Exceptional Electrocatalysts?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys offer a huge variety of multielement active sites on a single catalytic surface. This special polyelemental arrangement implies several different fundamental concepts in structure&#8211;activity correlations compared to traditional electrocatalysts, which are summarised and their implications for the possibility to adjust the catalytic properties with different limitations is discussed in detail.







Abstract
The formation of a vast number of different multielement active sites in compositionally complex solid solution materials, often more generally termed high&#8208;entropy alloys, offers new and unique concepts in catalyst design, which mitigate existing limitations and change the view on structure&#8211;activity relations. We discuss these concepts by summarising the currently existing fundamental knowledge and critically assess the chances and limitations of this material class, also highlighting design strategies. A roadmap is proposed, illustrating which of the characteristic concepts could be exploited using which strategy, and which breakthroughs might be possible to guide future research in this highly promising material class for (electro)catalysis.

         <title>A Solvent&#8208;Polarity&#8208;Induced Interface Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy towards Mesoporous Triazine&#8208;Based Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;polarity&#8208;induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed for the synthesis of mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. It exhibits precise, tunable pore sizes and pore structures. CO2 molecules can be adsorbed well as a result of the suitable pore sizes and the triazine unit.







Abstract
Triazine&#8208;based materials with porous structure have recently received numerous attentions as a fascinating new class because of their superior potential for various applications. However, it is still a formidable challenge to obtain triazine&#8208;based materials with precise adjustable meso&#8208;scaled pore sizes and controllable pore structures by reported synthesis approaches. Herein, we develop a solvent polarity induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. In this method, we employ a mixed solvent system within a suitable range of polarity (0.223&#8804;Lippert&#8211;Mataga parameter (&#916;f) &#8804;0.295) to induce valid self&#8208;assembly of skeleton precursor and surfactant. The as&#8208;prepared mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials possess uniform tunable pore sizes (8.2&#8211;14.0&#8197;nm), high surface areas and ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 18&#8201;%). Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO2 adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO2 over N2.

     alt="A Solvent-Polarity-Induced Interface Self-Assembly Strategy towards Mesoporous Triazine-Based Carbon Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solvent-polarity-induced interface self-assembly strategy is proposed for the synthesis of mesoporous triazine-based carbon materials. It exhibits precise, tunable pore sizes and pore structures. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules can be adsorbed well as a result of the suitable pore sizes and the triazine unit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triazine-based materials with porous structure have recently received numerous attentions as a fascinating new class because of their superior potential for various applications. However, it is still a formidable challenge to obtain triazine-based materials with precise adjustable meso-scaled pore sizes and controllable pore structures by reported synthesis approaches. Herein, we develop a solvent polarity induced interface self-assembly strategy to construct mesoporous triazine-based carbon materials. In this method, we employ a mixed solvent system within a suitable range of polarity (0.223&#8804;Lippert&#8211;Mataga parameter (&#916;&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;) &#8804;0.295) to induce valid self-assembly of skeleton precursor and surfactant. The as-prepared mesoporous triazine-based carbon materials possess uniform tunable pore sizes (8.2&#8211;14.0&#8197;nm), high surface areas and ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 18&#8201;%). Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine-based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Composites with Ordered Macropores and Hollow Walls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts with 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structures were successfully fabricated by using ordered macroporous ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 single crystals as precursors. This unique porous structure can greatly enhance mass transfer and accessibility of active sites to boost catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of furfural.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks provide versatile templates for the fabrication of various metal/carbon materials, but most of the derived composites possess only microspores, limiting the accessibility of embedded active sites. Herein, we report the construction of cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structure (H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/NC) using a single&#8208;crystal ordered macropore (SOM)&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 as precursor. During the pyrolysis, the interconnected macroporous structure of SOM&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 is mostly preserved, whereas the pore wall achieves a solid&#8208;to&#8208;hollow transformation with Co nanoparticles formed in the hollow walls. The 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous carbon skeleton may effectively promote long&#8208;range mass transfer and the hollow wall can facilitate local accessibility of active sites. This unique structure can greatly boost its catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to cyclopentanol, much superior to its counterparts without this well&#8208;designed hierarchically porous structure.

         <title>Selective Benzylic CH&#8208;Borylations by Tandem Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activations are environmentally and economically attractive synthetic strategies for the construction of functional molecules as they obviate the need for pre&#8208;functionalized substrates and minimize waste generation. Great challenges reside in the control of selectivities, the utilization of unbiased hydrocarbons, and the operation of atom&#8208;economical dehydrocoupling mechanisms. An especially mild borylation of benzylic CH bonds was developed with the ligand&#8208;free pre&#8208;catalyst Co[N(SiMe3)2]2 and the bench&#8208;stable and inexpensive borylation reagent B2pin2 that produces H2 as the only by&#8208;product.

         <title>Ultrastable Cu Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Liquid Fuels by Tuning C&#8722;C Coupling with CuTi Subsurface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Production of multicarbon (C  2+  ) liquid fuels is a challenging task for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction, mainly limited by the stabilization of reaction intermediates and their subsequent C&#8722;C couplings. In this work, we report a unique catalyst, the coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites on amorphous CuTi alloy (a&#8208;CuTi@Cu) toward electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction to multicarbon (C  2&#8722;4  ) liquid fuels. Remarkably, the electrocatalyst yields ethanol, acetone and n&#8208;butanol as major products with a total C  2&#8722;4  faradaic efficiency of about 49% at &#8722;0.8 V  vs.  reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which can be maintained for at least 3 months. Theoretical simulation together with  in&#8208;situ  characterization reveals that subsurface Ti atoms can increase the electron density of surface Cu sites and enhance the adsorption of *CO intermediate, which in turn reduces the energy barriers required for *CO dimerization and trimerization. This work refreshes the concept that the catalytically inactive element can maneuver the behaviour of catalytic sites in electrocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling from the angle of electron density.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfigurable Two&#8208;Dimensional DNA Lattices: Static and Dynamic Angle Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Branched DNA motifs serve as the basic construction elements for all synthetic DNA nanostructures. However, precise control of branching orientation remains a key challenge to further heighten the overall structural order. In this study, we use two strategies to control the branching orientation. The first one is based on immobile Holliday junctions which employ specific nucleotide sequences at the branch points which dictate their orientation. The second strategy is to use angle&#8208;enforcing struts to fix the branching orientation with flexible spacers at the branch points. We have also demonstrated that the branching orientation control can be achieved dynamically, either by canonical Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing or non&#8208;canonical nucleobase interactions (  e.g.,  i&#8208;motif and G&#8208;quadruplex). With precise angle control and feedback from the chemical environment, these results will enable novel DNA nanomechanical sensing devices, and precisely&#8208;ordered three&#8208;dimensional architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside a Shell&#8212;Organometallic Catalysis Inside Encapsulin Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal catalysis strategy has been developed inside a confined space using encapsulins equipped with HaloTag and [CpRu(hydroxyquinoline)(allyl)]PF6. The strategy opens up a toolbox for designing compartmentalized &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8221; reactions inside living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently labeled encapsulins on a single&#8208;molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst via covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform in&#8197;vitro catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.

         <title>Mapping of N&#8722;C Bond Formation from a Series of Crystalline Peri&#8208;Substituted Naphthalenes by Charge Density and Solid&#8208;State NMR Methodologies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of charge density measurements, solid&#8208;state NMR 1JNC couplings, and DFT calculations is presented to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation for a series of model crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes.







Abstract
A combination of charge density studies and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1JNC coupling measurements supported by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation between a nucleophilic nitrogen atom and an electrophilic sp2 carbon atom in a series of crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. As the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C distance reduces there is a sharp decrease in the Laplacian derived from increasing charge density between the two groups at ca. N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C = 1.8&#8197;&#197;, with the periodic DFT calculations predicting, and heteronuclear spin&#8208;echo NMR measurements confirming, the 1JNC couplings of &#8776;3&#8211;6&#8197;Hz for long C&#8722;N bonds (1.60&#8211;1.65&#8197;&#197;), and 1JNC couplings of &lt;1&#8197;Hz for N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C &gt;2.1&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Pyrrole Hemithioindigo Antimitotics with Near&#8208;Quantitative Bidirectional Photoswitching that Photocontrol Cellular Microtubule Dynamics with Single&#8208;Cell Precision**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole hemithioindigos can be near&#8208;quantitatively photoisomerised by the laser wavelengths available on confocal microscopes. The first pyrrole hemithioindigo&#8208;based photopharmaceuticals, PHTubs, which are photoswitchable tubulin inhibitors, have been developed. PHTubs optically inhibit microtubule dynamics in live cells with single&#8208;cell, second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision, with both lit&#8208;active and dark&#8208;active compounds demonstrated in action.







Abstract
We report the first cellular application of the emerging near&#8208;quantitative photoswitch pyrrole hemithioindigo, by rationally designing photopharmaceutical PHTub inhibitors of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin. PHTubs allow simultaneous visible&#8208;light imaging and photoswitching in live cells, delivering cell&#8208;precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, and photocontrol over cell cycle progression and cell death. This is the first acute use of a hemithioindigo photopharmaceutical for high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution biological control in live cells. It additionally demonstrates the utility of near&#8208;quantitative photoswitches, by enabling a dark&#8208;active design to overcome residual background activity during cellular photopatterning. This work opens up new horizons for high&#8208;precision microtubule research using PHTubs and shows the cellular applicability of pyrrole hemithioindigo as a valuable scaffold for photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.

         <title>Allosteric Switching of Calmodulin in a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) Nanopore&#8208;Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of calmodulin were distinguished by Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA). The D129G mutant of calmodulin was also discriminated. Interactions between calmodulin and other divalent ions were also detected, demonstrating high resolution structural profiling.







Abstract
Recent developments concerning large protein nanopores suggest a new approach to structure profiling of native folded proteins. In this work, the large vestibule of Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) and calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+&#8208;binding protein, were used in the direct observation of the protein structure. Three conformers, including the Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of CaM, were unambiguously distinguished. A disease related mutant, CaM D129G was also discriminated by MspA, revealing how a single amino acid replacement can interfere with the Ca2+&#8208;binding capacity of the whole protein. The binding capacity and aggregation effect of CaM induced by different ions (Mg2+/Sr2+/Ba2+/Ca2+/Pb2+/Tb3+) were also investigated and the stability of MspA in extreme conditions was evaluated. This work demonstrates the most systematic single&#8208;molecule investigation of different allosteric conformers of CaM, acknowledging the high sensing resolution offered by the MspA nanopore trap.

         <title>Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Triggered by Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Initiated Chemiluminescence for Activated Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known tetrazole/alkene &#8220;photoclick&#8221; chemistry, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered nanoparticle (NP) aggregation strategy was herein reported to activate the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapeutic functions of gold NPs for specific visualization and efficient treatment of tumors in&#8197;vivo. This approach could provide a valuable tool for achieving precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Developing endogenous photo&#8208;activated theranostic platforms to overcome the limitation of low tissue&#8208;penetration from external light sources is highly significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. We report a H2O2&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;triggered nanoparticle aggregation strategy to activate theranostic functions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for effective tumor imaging and therapy. Two types of AuNPs (tAuNP &amp; mAuNP) were designed and fabricated by conjugating 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole and methacrylic acid onto the surface of AuNPs, respectively. Luminol was adsorbed onto the mAuNPs to afford self&#8208;illuminating mAuNP/Lu NPs that could produce strong CL by reaction with H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment, which triggers significant aggregation of AuNPs resulting in enhanced accumulation and retention of AuNPs for activated photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy of tumors. We thus believe that this approach may offer a promising tool for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Harnessing Shape Complementarity for Upgraded Cyclohexane Purification through Adaptive Bottlenecked Pores in an Imidazole&#8208;Containing MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bottlenecked pores in an imidazole&#8208;containing MOF, namely MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13, can adapt in shape to specifically binding of benzene molecules, making it desirable for upgraded purification to yield ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane in the late stage of industrial liquid&#8208;phase production.







Abstract
Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8211;protein interfaces. An analogy to such a function can be drawn conceptually for crystalline porous solids; yet the manifested entities are rare in reticular chemistry. The bottleneck&#8208;shaped pores carved out of a metal&#8208;organic framework, Zn(MIBA)2 (aka. MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13), can perfectly accommodate benzene molecules. Remarkably, its framework adapts to the optimal guest binding&#8208;the enhanced host&#8211;guest interactions in the neck in turn minimize the guest&#8208;guest repulsion in the pore to the extent it turns into attraction&#8208;as demonstrated by the combined X&#8208;ray structural and DFT computational studies. This adaptive material can be used for liquid&#8208;phase production of ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane, achieving a balance between uptake capacity and separation selectivity and surpassing the performances of other porous and nonporous crystals reported recently (e.g. product purity 99.4&#8201;% vs. 97.5&#8201;% to date).

&lt;p&gt;The bottlenecked pores in an imidazole-containing MOF, namely MAF-stu-13, can adapt in shape to specifically binding of benzene molecules, making it desirable for upgraded purification to yield ultrahigh-purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane in the late stage of industrial liquid-phase production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8211;protein interfaces. An analogy to such a function can be drawn conceptually for crystalline porous solids; yet the manifested entities are rare in reticular chemistry. The bottleneck-shaped pores carved out of a metal-organic framework, Zn(MIBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aka. MAF-stu-13), can perfectly accommodate benzene molecules. Remarkably, its framework adapts to the optimal guest binding-the enhanced host&#8211;guest interactions in the neck in turn minimize the guest-guest repulsion in the pore to the extent it turns into attraction-as demonstrated by the combined X-ray structural and DFT computational studies. This adaptive material can be used for liquid-phase production of ultrahigh-purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane, achieving a balance between uptake capacity and separation selectivity and surpassing the performances of other porous and nonporous crystals reported recently (e.g. product purity 99.4&#8201;% vs. 97.5&#8201;% to date).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dissection of the Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Contributions to Aromatic Stacking Interactions in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;Hammett approach has been used to dissect out the polar contributions to the total aromatic stacking energy.







Abstract
Aromatic stacking interactions have been a matter of study and debate due to their crucial role in chemical and biological systems. The strong dependence on orientation and solvent together with the relatively small interaction energies have made evaluation and rationalization a challenge for experimental and theoretical chemists. We have used a supramolecular cage formed by two tris(pyridylmethyl)amines units to build chemical Double Mutant Cycles (DMC) for the experimental measurement of the free energies of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Extrapolating the substituent effects to remove the contribution due to electrostatic interactions reveals that there is a substantial contribution to the measured stacking interaction energies which is due to non&#8208;polar interactions (&#8722;3 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The perfectly flat nature of the surface of an aromatic ring gives &#960;&#8208;stacking an inherent advantage over non&#8208;polar interactions with alkyl groups and accounts for the wide&#8208;spread prevalence of stacking interactions in Nature.

         <title>Neutrophil&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe Development through Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;Cell Distinction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly lipophilic fluorescent probe, NeutropG, has been developed for the specific distinction and imaging of human neutrophils over other blood cell types. The staining mechanism of neutrophil&#8208;selective NeutropG is achieved by metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis. NeutropG enters a neutrophil transported by CD36, then forms a lipid droplet with the help of ACSL and DGAT.







Abstract
Human neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes and have been considered as the first line of defence in the innate immune system. Selective imaging of live neutrophils will facilitate the in&#8197;situ study of neutrophils in infection or inflammation events as well as clinical diagnosis. However, small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based probes for the discrimination of live neutrophils among different granulocytes in human blood have yet to be reported. Herein, we report the first fluorescent probe NeutropG for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils. The selective staining mechanism of NeutropG is elucidated as metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis with the help of ACSL and DGAT. Finally, NeutropG is applied to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples by showing a high correlation with the current clinical method.

         <title>Realizing Record&#8208;High Electroluminescence Efficiency of 31.5&#8201;% for Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with intramolecular hydrogen bonding are developed, which exhibit excellent photoluminescence efficiencies and large horizontal dipole ratios, and thus furnish the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art red and near infrared OLEDs, with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 31.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules comprised of an electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrazino[2,3&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile core and various electron&#8208;donating triarylamines are developed. They can form intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which is conducive to improving emission efficiency and promoting horizontal orientation and show near infrared (NIR) emissions (692&#8211;710 nm) in neat films and red delayed fluorescence (606&#8211;630 nm) with high photoluminescence quantum yields (73&#8211;90%) in doped films. They prefer horizontal orientation with large horizontal dipole ratios in films, rendering high optical out&#8208;coupling factors (0.39&#8211;0.41). Their non&#8208;doped OLEDs exhibit NIR lights (716&#8211;748 nm) with maximum external quantum efficiencies (&#951;ext,max) of 1.0&#8211;1.9%. And their doped OLEDs radiate red lights (606&#8211;648 nm) and achieve record&#8208;beating &#951;ext,max of up to 31.5%. These new red TADF materials should have great potentials in display and lighting devices.

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using a BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system. Chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins were yielded in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using our BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system, providing chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee). The relationship between the enantioselectivities of the hydrogenations and the dihedral angles and the resulting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking effects of the BridgePhos&#8208;Rh complexes, which were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, are discussed. The corresponding hydrogenated products allow for many transformations, providing several chiral skeletons with important physiological and pharmacological activities.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical vapor deposition of an ionic liquid allows the formation of ionogel thin films and microdrops in high resolution. The non&#8208;volatile ionic liquid is formed on a surface by reaction of two non&#8208;volatile precursors. A broad range of applications will benefit from this new &#8220;IL&#8208;CVD&#8221; approach, which enables the fabrication of microdevices.







Abstract
Film deposition and high&#8208;resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL&#8208;CVD method is based on the formation of a non&#8208;volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL&#8208;CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors.

     alt="Chemical Vapor Deposition of Ionic Liquids for the Fabrication of Ionogel Films and Patterns"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical vapor deposition of an ionic liquid allows the formation of ionogel thin films and microdrops in high resolution. The non-volatile ionic liquid is formed on a surface by reaction of two non-volatile precursors. A broad range of applications will benefit from this new &#8220;IL-CVD&#8221; approach, which enables the fabrication of microdevices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film deposition and high-resolution patterning of ionic liquids (ILs) remain a challenge, despite a broad range of applications that would benefit from this type of processing. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ILs. The IL-CVD method is based on the formation of a non-volatile IL through the reaction of two vaporized precursors. Ionogel micropatterns can be easily obtained via the combination of IL-CVD and standard photolithography, and the resulting microdrop arrays can be used as microreactors. The IL-CVD approach will facilitate leveraging the properties of ILs in a range of applications and microfabricated devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 Multifunctional Catalytic Sites for Durable Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 active site structure was developed as an efficient sulfur host material to realize excellent electrochemical performance at high sulfur loading.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation system for advanced energy storage owing to a high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. However, the practical implementation of Li&#8208;S batteries has been thwarted by the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes. Herein, a novel single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe&#8208;N5 coordination structure (Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C) is precisely synthesized by an absorption&#8211;pyrolysis strategy and introduced as an effective sulfur host material. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergism between atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N5 active sites and the unique carbon support. The results exhibit that the sulfur composite cathode built on the Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C can not only adsorb polysulfides via chemical interaction, but also boost the redox reaction kinetics, thus mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the robust three&#8208;dimensional nitrogen doped carbon nanofiber with large surface area, and high porosity enables strong physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer process. Attributed to such unique features, Li&#8208;S batteries with S/Fe&#8208;N5&#8208;C composite cathode realize outstanding cyclability and rate capability, as well as high areal capacities under raised sulfur loading, which demonstrates great potential in developing advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spin&#8208;Filtering Transport in Chiral Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity in Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites creates a platform for organic spintronics. Combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and inoxidizability of halide ions, lead&#8208;free and air&#8208;stable chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 were synthesized by facile methods. These compounds offer efficient (&#8776;90&#8201;%) spin&#8208;filtering charge transport.







Abstract
Chiral Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites exhibit outstanding chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) performance, but the nontoxic lead&#8208;free hybrid materials with high stability are still greatly desired for spin filtering in spintronic applications. We synthesize chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 (MBA=methylbenzylammonium; X=Cl, Br) with characteristic 0D CuX4 tetrahedral structural motifs, combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and air stability of halide ions (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Despite similar structural and electronic features, (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuBr4 shows much smaller chiroptical activity than the chloride counterpart. Magnetically conductive atomic force microscopy measurements display a typical spin&#8208;polarized charge&#8208;transport property with high efficiency up to 90&#8201;% for both copper halides. Our work expands the CISS effect into eco&#8208;friendly and stable metal&#8211;organic halides, which is promising for applications in spintronics based on transition&#8208;metal hybrid systems.

         <title>Nanocarriers for Skin Applications: Where Do We Stand?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of nanocarriers for dermal drug delivery is a very promising research topic, as it enables the penetration of therapeutics across the skin, a highly complex biological barrier. This Review highlights recent advances in this area and describes the current status of nanocarriers to undergo market translation.







Abstract
Skin penetration of active molecules for treatment of diverse diseases is a major field of research owing to the advantages associated with the skin like easy accessibility, reduced systemic&#8208;derived side effects, and increased therapeutic efficacy. Despite these advantages, dermal drug delivery is generally challenging due to the low skin permeability of therapeutics. Although various methods have been developed to improve skin penetration and permeation of therapeutics, they are usually aggressive and could lead to irreversible damage to the stratum corneum. Nanosized carrier systems represent an alternative approach for current technologies, with minimal damage to the natural barrier function of skin. In this Review, the use of nanoparticles to deliver drug molecules, genetic material, and vaccines into the skin is discussed. In addition, nanotoxicology studies and the recent clinical development of nanoparticles are highlighted to shed light on their potential to undergo market translation.

         <title>Phosphorus Induced Electron Localization of Single Iron Sites for Boosted CO2 Electroreduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single phosphorous atoms were successfully incorporated into a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds, which were demonstrated to promote CO2 electroreduction to CO at low overpotentials. The maximum CO faradaic efficiency was over 97&#8201;% at a low overpotential with a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals and fuels has recently attracted much interest, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. In this work, single P atoms were introduced into a N&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC/NPC) mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. This catalyst exhibited a CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;97&#8201;% at a low overpotential of 320&#8197;mV, and a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gold catalysts. Experimental analysis combined with DFT calculations suggested that single P atom in high coordination shells (n&#8805;3), in particular the third coordination shell of Fe center enhanced the electronic localization of Fe, which improved the stabilization of the key *COOH intermediate on Fe, leading to superior CO2 electrochemical reduction performance at low overpotentials.

Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) was employed for background&#8208;free detection of hyperpolarized NMR resonances even in the extreme case of protonated solvents and biological fluids. This approach paves the way to a wide range of high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208; and in&#8197;vivo MRI applications of proton detection of hyperpolarized molecules.







Abstract
We report on the utility of Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission Radiation (RASER) for background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized biomolecules. We performed hyperpolarization of &#8776;0.3&#8197;M ethyl acetate via pairwise parahydrogen addition to vinyl acetate. A proton NMR signal with signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio exceeding 100&#8201;000 was detected without radio&#8208;frequency excitation at the clinically relevant magnetic field of 1.4&#8197;T using a standard (non&#8208;cryogenic) inductive detector with quality factor of Q=68. No proton background signal was observed from protonated solvent (methanol) or other added co&#8208;solvents such as ethanol, water or bovine serum. Moreover, we demonstrate RASER detection without radio&#8208;frequency excitation of a bolus of hyperpolarized contrast agent in biological fluid. Completely background&#8208;free proton detection of hyperpolarized contrast agents in biological media paves the way to new applications in the areas of high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy and in&#8197;vivo spectroscopy and imaging.

         <title>Acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen using molecular catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acceptorless dehydrogenation of methanol to carbon monoxide and hydrogen was investigated using homogeneous molecular complexes. Complexes of ruthenium and manganese comprising the MACHO ligand framework showed promising activities for this reaction. The molecular ruthenium complex [RuH(CO)(BH  4  )(HN(C  2  H  4  PPh  2  )  2  )] (Ru&#8208;MACHO&#8208;BH) achieved up to 3150 turnovers for carbon monoxide and 9230 turnovers for hydrogen formation at 150&#176;C reaching pressures up to 12 bar when the decomposition was carried out in a closed vessel. Control experiments affirmed that the metal complex mediates the initial fast dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate followed by subsequent slow decarbonylation. Depending on the catalyst and reaction conditions, the CO/H  2  ratio in the gas mixture thus varies over a broad range from almost pure hydrogen to the stoichiometric limit of 1:2.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining electrochemiluminescence detection with aptamer&#8208;gated indicator releasing mesoporous nanoparticles enables ppt sensitivity for strip&#8208;based rapid tests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) and aptamer&#8208;gated indicator delivering (gAID) magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles embedded into glass fibre paper functionalised with poly(ethyleneglycol) and N&#8208;(3&#8208;triethoxysilylpropyl)diethanolamine allowed the development of a rapid test that detects penicillin directly in diluted milk down to 50 &#177; 9 ppt in &lt;5 min. Covalent attachment of the aptamer &#8216;cap&#8217; to the silica scaffold enabled pore closure through non&#8208;covalent electrostatic interactions with surface amino groups, while binding of penicillin led to a folding&#8208;up of the aptamer thus releasing the ECL reporter Ru(bpy)32+ previously loaded into the material and letting it be detected after lateral flow by a smartphone camera upon electrochemical excitation with a screen printed electrode inserted into a 3D&#8208;printed holder. The approach is simple, generic and presents advantages with respect to sensitivity, measurement uncertainty and robustness compared with conventional fluorescence or electrochemical detection, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;need analyses of challenging matrices and analytes at ultra&#8208;trace levels.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Site Concerted Proton&#8722;Electron Transfer in a Manganese&#8208;Based Complete Functional Model for the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a paradigm for multiple&#8208;site concerted proton&#8722;electron transfer (MS&#8208;CPET) in the process of proton reduction or hydrogen oxidation, the active site of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase (H  2  ase) is preorganized with an amine (&#8216;azadithiolate&#8217;) as a proton relay and a [4Fe4S] subunit as an electron reservoir. The synergy of two individual factors efficiently lowers the overpotential for these reactions. In this study, we report  a mononuclear manganese  complex  fac&#8208;  [Mn(CO)  3  (6&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenol)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;quinoline) Br] (  1  ) as a rare model to fully mimic the functions of the H  2  ase. In  1  , a redox active bidentate ligand decorated with a pendent phenol replicates the roles of the electron reservoir and the proton relay in natural enzyme. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal two consecutive MS&#8208;CPET processes in the catalytic cycle. For each MS&#8208;CPET, electron prestored in the reductive ligand and proton at the proximal phenol synchronously transfer to the Mn center in a concerted way. By virtue of this mechanism, complex  1  &#160;exhibited a low overpotential comparable to that of natual enzyme in electrochemical hydrogen production using phenol as a proton source.&#160;.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Vicinal Difunctionalization of Five&#8208;Membered Heteroarenes with Dual Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article a new reaction mode of palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis is reported involving the selective coupling of two different carbon&#8208;based electrophiles for vicinal double C&#8722;H functionalization of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes in a site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The key is to use alkynyl bromides as the second electrophile, which allows vicinal difunctionalization of a wide range of heteroarenes including pyrroles, thiophenes and furans at their C4 and C5 positions. One&#8208; or two&#8208;step tetrafunctionalizations of simple pyrrole and thiophene have also been realized. The C2&#8208;substituted NBEs prove most effective in these reactions, and the mechanistic exploration discloses the origin of the high selectivity of this transformation. Synthetic utility of this method has been exemplified in the concise preparations of thiophene&#8208;containing organic materials and a protein kinase inhibitor analogue. Preliminary success has also been achieved in a direct annulation event, using a tethered ketone as the second electrophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Assisted Artesunate Delivery by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Synergistic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical translation of artesunate (ATS) as a potent antitumor drug has been obstructed by its rapid degradation and low bioavailability. Herein, we report the development of ATS nanomedicine through the self&#8208;assembly with Mn[Co(CN)6]2/3 1/3 metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) having hidden missing linkers. The defects originated from the missing linkers play a key role in increasing the biological stability and tumor accumulation of ATS. Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and ATS can be co&#8208;loaded into MOFs for a synergistic antitumor efficacy. In the presence of intracellular HCO3&#8208;, Mn2+ acts as an efficient catalyst to promote the bicarbonate&#8208;activated H2O2 system and induce oxidative death to cancer cells based on ATS with an endoperoxide bridge. The released [CoIII(CN)6] linker undergoes a redox reaction with intracellular glutathione to prevent the scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species, contributing to synergistic chemodynamic therapy of ATS and photodynamic therapy of Ce6. Thus, defect&#8208;engineered MOFs with hidden missing linkers hold great promises in advancing the practical uses of ATS as an antitumor medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>IrOx@In2O3 heterojunction made of individually crystallized oxides for weak&#8208;light promoted electrocatalytic water oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, multi&#8208;field coupling especially photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysis has been studied for further improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.  Herein, we for the first time employ n&#8208;type semiconductor of cubic In  2  O  3  for loading IrO  x  species (mass ratio: Ir to In  2  O  3  is 17.6%) forming IrO  x  @In  2  O  3  heterojunction, which exhibits outstanding OER performance promoted by weak&#8208;light irradiation.  Notably, IrO  x  (ca. 1.7 nm) and In  2  O  3  are found to independently crystallize during the heterogeneous nucleation process with no Ir atoms doped in In  2  O  3  lattice, avoiding Ir loss and ensuring all Ir&#8208;based sites&#8217; full exposure. IrO  x  @In  2  O  3  heterojunction shows the enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation activity with a overpotential of 190 and 231 mV at the current densities of 10 and 50 mA/cm  2  , surpassing all reported IrO  x  &#8208;based catalysts ever reported. Significantly, the surface nano&#8208;sized IrO  x  can be 100% activated to act as the OER sites under one weak&#8208;light beam of LED&#8208;365 (1.8 mW/cm  2  ) and the overpotential is further reduced to 176 and 210 mV to deliver the respective current. This work can help us design more efficient multi&#8208;field coupling OER systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Enhancement and Kinetics Regulation of Fmoc&#8208; Diphenylalanine  Hydrogels by Thioflavin T</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of peptides is a key direction for fabrication of advanced materials. Novel approaches for fine tuning of macroscopic and microscopic properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies are of a high demand for constructing biomaterials with desired properties. In this work, while studying the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;Diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) dipeptide self&#8208;assembly using the Thioflavin T (ThT) dye, we observed that the presence of ThT strongly modifies structural and mechanical properties of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel. Notably, the presence of ThT resulted in a tenfold increase of the gelation time and in the formation of short and dense fibers in the hydrogel. As a result of these morphological alteration higher thermal stability, and, most important, tenfold increase of the hydrogel rigidity was achieved. Hence, ThT not only slowed the kinetics of the Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel formation, but also strongly enhanced its mechanical properties. In this study, we provide a detailed description of the ThT effect on the hydrogel properties and suggest the mechanisms for this phenomenon, paving the way for the novel approach to the control of the peptide hydrogels&#8217; micro&#8208; and macroscale properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected bis&#8208;cyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf  2  in the presence of  i  PrOH, producing 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[  cd  ]indole derivatives in good yields. Combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed  N  &#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted to nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

         <title>A Biocatalytic Cascade in an Ultrastable Mesoporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MHOF)&#8208;confined biocatalytic cascade nanoreactor is constructed. This MHOF cascade nanoreactor has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient diffusion of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates and displays the advantages of superior activities, extended scope of substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables mimicking intracellular signal communications and complex chemical transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of using mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) as the protecting scaffold to organize a biocatalytic cascade. The confined microenvironment of MHOFs has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient transport of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates. This new MHOF&#8208;confined cascade system shows superior activity, extended scope of catalytic substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables the operation of complex chemical transformations in a porous carrier. In addition, the advantages of MHOF&#8208;confined cascades system for point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensing are also demonstrated. This study highlights the advantages of HOFs as scaffold for multiple enzyme assemblies, which has huge potential for mimicking complex cellular transformation networks in a controllable manner.

         <title>An Integrated Photoelectrochemical Nanotool for Intracellular Drug Delivery and Treatment Effect Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With reduced background and high sensitivity, photoelectrochemistry (PEC) may be applied as an intracellular nanotool and open a new technological direction of single&#8208;cell study. Nevertheless, the present palette of single&#8208;cell tools lacks such a PEC&#8208;oriented solution. Here a dual&#8208;functional photocathodic single&#8208;cell nanotool capable of direct electroosmotic intracellular drug delivery and evaluation of oxidative stress is devised by engineering a target&#8208;specific organic molecule/NiO/Ni film at the tip of a nanopipette. Specifically, the organic molecule probe serves simultaneously as the biorecognition element and sensitizer to synergize with p&#8208;type NiO. Upon intracellular delivery at picoliter level, the oxidative stress effect will cause structural change of the organic probe, switching its optical absorption and altering the cathodic response. This work has revealed the potential of PEC single&#8208;cell nanotool and extended the boundary of current single&#8208;cell electroanalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiopure C5 Pentaindenocorannulenes: Chiral Graphenoid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four chiral C5 bowl&#8208;shaped aromatic hydrocarbons with exceptional configurational stability have been derived from pentaindenocorannulene have been synthesized. The chirality of these carbon bowls is instrumental to establishing the formation of columnar supramolecular assemblies in solution.







Abstract
Chiral carbon nanomaterials offer numerous prospects for material science. As a fundamental building block for non&#8208;planar graphenoid materials, pentaindenocorannulene (PIC) with its C5v symmetrical structure presents a platform for creation of supramolecular chiral carbon materials. Specifically, when uniformly penta&#8208;substituted on its periphery, PIC generates C5 symmetrical chiral buckybowls capable of columnar stacking. The synthesis and resolution of such PICs are achieved, assignment of absolute configuration is established by comparison of ECD and VCD spectra with theory, and material characterization is reported. Evidence for columnar stacking in solution and in the crystal is presented.

         <title>Energy Migration Control of Multimodal Emissions in an Er3+&#8208;Doped Nanostructure for Information Encryption and Deep&#8208;Learning Decoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of multimodal emissions has been demonstrated by a new type of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide nanocrystals (NCs). The multiresponse color&#8208;switchable output can be used for information security. Based on the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of these NCs and deep learning, it was possible to store and decode information in pork tissue by irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Modulating the emission wavelengths of materials has always been a primary focus of fluorescence technology. Nanocrystals (NCs) doped with lanthanide ions with rich energy levels can produce a variety of emissions at different excitation wavelengths. However, the control of multimodal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide NCs with color&#8208;switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535&#8197;nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Emission in a Coassembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coassembly systems are formed by doping carbonyl compounds into polyvinyl alcohol. After light irradiation the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network stabilizes the free radicals generated for the carbonyl compounds, leading to strong free&#8208;radical emission. Light/heat&#8208;controlled information encryption using these systems is demonstrated.







Abstract
Developing radical emission at ambient conditions is a challenging task since radical species are unstable in air. In the present work, we overcome this challenge by coassembling a series of tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The strong hydrogen bonds between the guest dopants and the PVA host matrix protect the free radicals of carbonyl compounds after light irradiation, leading to strong solid state free radical emission. Changing temperature and peripheral functional groups of the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes can influence the intensity of the radical emission. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations predict that such free radical fluorescence originates from anti&#8208;Kasha D2&#8594;D0 vertical emission by the anion radicals. The photoinduced radical emission by the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes was successfully utilized for information encryption application.

Krypton difluoride and [XeF][AsF6] react in HF solvent at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to yield the first mixed KrII/XeII compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF. The structure and bonding of [FKrFXeF]+ were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations (ELF, AIM, NBO, and MEPS analyses). Upon warming, the compound undergoes redox decomposition in HF to yield mixed KrII/XeIV and KrII/XeVI species.







Abstract
Reaction of [XeF][AsF6] with excess KrF2 at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent has yielded the first mixed KrII/XeII noble&#8208;gas compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6] &#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, a salt of the [FKrFXeF]+ cation. The potent oxidative fluorinating properties of KrII fluoride species resulted in oxidation of XeII to XeIV in aHF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form the mixed KrII/XeIV cocrystals, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4 and XeF4&#8901;KrF2. Further decomposition at 22&#8201;&#176;C resulted in oxidation of XeIV to XeVI to give the recently reported KrII/XeVI complexes, [F5Xe(FKrF)n][AsF6] (n=1, 2), [F5Xe][AsF6], and a new KrII/XeVI complex, [(F5Xe)2(&#956;&#8208;FKrF)(AsF6)2], which was characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) Raman spectroscopy. The [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4&#8201;, and XeF4&#8901;KrF2 compounds were characterized by LT Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to assess the bonding in [FKrFXeF]+, [Kr2F3]+, and [Xe2F3]+ and to aid in their vibrational assignments.

Further decomposition at 22&#8201;&#176;C resulted in oxidation of Xe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; to Xe&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt; to give the recently reported Kr&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Xe&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, [F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Xe(FKrF)&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Access to Dihydroquinoxalinones via Formal &#945;&#8208;Halo Acyl Halide Synthon in One Pot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot catalytic and scalable Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) strategy towards medicinally significant dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano epoxides as new masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, is reported. Two out of the three steps are catalysed by highly robust, recyclable and easily available quinine&#8208;derived urea.







Abstract
An enantioselective one&#8208;pot catalytic strategy to dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring novel 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano enantioenriched epoxides as masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, followed by a domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC), is documented. A popular quinine&#8208;derived urea served as the catalyst in two out of the three steps performed in the same solvent using commercially available aldehydes, (phenylsulfonyl)acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide and 1,2&#8208;phenylendiamines. Medicinally relevant 3&#8208;aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted heterocycles are isolated in generally good to high overall yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). A rare example of excellent reusability of an organocatalyst at higher scale, subjected to oxidative conditions, is demonstrated. Mechanistically, labile &#945;&#8208;ketosulfone has been detected as the intermediate involved in the DROC process. Theoretical calculations on the key epoxidation step rationalize the observed stereocontrol, highlighting the important role played by the sulfone group.

         <title>An NADPH&#8208;dependent Ketoreductase Catalyses the Tetracyclic to Pentacyclic Skeletal Rearrangement in Chartreusin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox tailoring enzymes play key roles in generating structural complexity and diversity in type II polyketides. In chartreusin biosynthesis, the early  13  C&#8208;labeling experiments and bioinformatic analysis suggest the unusual aglycone is originated from a tetracyclic anthracyclic polyketide. Here, we demonstrated that the carbon skeleton rearrangement from a linear anthracyclic polyketide to an angular pentacyclic biosynthetic intermediate requires two redox enzymes. The flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase ChaZ catalyses a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation on resomycin C to form a seven&#8208;membered lactone. Subsequently, a ketoreductase ChaE rearranges the carbon skeleton and afford the &#945;&#8208;pyrone containing pentacyclic intermediate in an NADPH&#8208;dependent manner, presumably via a cascade reactions including the reduction of the lactone carbonyl group, Aldol&#8208;type reaction, followed by a spontaneous &#947;&#8208;lactone ring formation, and aromatization. Our work reveals an unprecedented function of a ketoreductase that contributes to generate structural complexity of aromatic polyketide.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step enzymatic labeling reveals a critical role of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O&#8208;linked  N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous post&#8208;translational modification of proteins that is essential for cell function. Perturbation of  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation leads to altered cell&#8208;cycle progression and DNA damage response. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we develop a highly sensitive one&#8208;step enzymatic strategy for capture and profiling  O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins in cells. Using this strategy, we discover that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), an essential enzyme in DNA synthesis, is a novel substrate for  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation. FEN1  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle.  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation at the serine 352 of FEN1 disrupts its interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) at the replication foci, and leads to altered cell cycle, defects in DNA replication, accumulation of DNA damage, and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage agents. Thus, our study provides a sensitive method for profiling  O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins, and reveals an unknown mechanism of  O&#8208;GlcNAcylation in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage response.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Instantaneous and Continuous Synthesis of Ultrasmall Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) may generate unique properties to expand the scope of applications. However, the synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize ultrasmall MOFs by high gravity technology. With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high&#8208;gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub&#8208;5 nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF&#8208;8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94 % or 75 % compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF&#8208;8. More importantly, this approach is readily scalable with the highest space&#8208;time yield for nano&#8208;MOFs, which may promote the convenient synthesis and practical applications of ultrasmall MOFs in large&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

With the aid of tremendous intensification of molecular mixing and mass transfer in high-gravity field, six typical MOFs were obtained instantaneously in a continuous way. These samples are monodispersed with sub-5 nm in size, smaller than the previously reported values and even close to the length of one crystal unit cell. As a proof-of-concept, catalytic activity for Knoevenagel reaction can be significantly enhanced using ultrasmall ZIF-8. Conversion time of benzaldehyde was decreased by 94 % or 75 % compared to those using conventional or hierarchically porous ZIF-8.

         <title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Catalyzed Carbenium Ion Generation and Autocatalytic Pyrazole Synthesis &#8212; A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metal&#8208;free organic synthesis using triarylboranes as catalysts has become a prevalent research area. Herein we report a comprehensive computational and experimental study for the synthesis of highly selective N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the generation of carbenium species from the reaction between aryl esters and vinyl diazoacetates in presence of catalytic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3  ]. DFT studies were undertaken to illuminate the reaction mechanism revealing that the in&#8208;situ generation of a carbenium species acts as an autocatalyst to prompt the formation of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles regiospecifically in good to excellent yields (up to 81%).</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins at the solid&#8208;gas interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;metalation is one of the most promising synthesis routes to include a single metal atom in a tetrapyrrolic macrocycle in the case of organic frameworks supported by metal surfaces. The molecule&#8208;surface interaction may provide the charge transfer and the geometric distortion of the molecular plane that are necessary for metal inclusion, thus mimicking enzymatic metalation mechanisms of porphyrins in biology. However, while the latter process proceeds at room temperature, at a metal surface, instead, the presence of an activation barrier can represent a technical obstacle that cannot be compensated by a higher substrate temperature without affecting the layer integrity. The formation of the intermediate state, the sitting&#8208;atop complex that weakens the two N&#8208;H bonds in the tetrapyrrole preceding the metal insertion step, can be facilitated in some cases by oxygen pre&#8208;adsorption at the supporting metal surface, like in the case of the 2H&#8208;TPP/Pd(100) system. In such cases, the activation barrier can be overcome by mild annealing, yielding the formation of desorbing products (hydrogen, water) and of the metalated tetrapyrrole. We show here that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;TPP molecules at the Pd(100) surface can be promoted already at room temperature by the presence of an oxygen gas phase at close&#8208;to&#8208;ambient conditions via an Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism, resembling the asymmetric interactions available in enzymatic pockets, thus opening the way to novel routes to metalate organic frameworks at surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Predesign of Catalytically Active Sites via Stable Coordination Cluster Model System for Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purposefully designing the well&#8208;defined catalysts for the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 is an extremely important but challenging work. In this work, three crystalline trinuclear copper clusters (Cu3&#8208;X, X= Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, NO3&#8722;) have been designed, containing three active Cu sites with the identical coordination environment and appropriate spatial distance, delivering high selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C2H4. The highest faradaic efficiency of Cu3&#8208;X for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion can be adjusted from 31.90% to 55.01% by simply replacing the counter anions (NO3&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). The DFT calculation results verify that Cu3&#8208;X can facilitate the C&#8208;C coupling of identical *CHO intermediates, subsequently forming molecular symmetrical C2H4 product. This work provides an important molecular model system and a new design perspective for electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products with symmetrical molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a straightforward strategy to obtain enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic benzosiloles remains a challenging yet appealing synthesis venture due to their potential future application in chiral electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this context, all of the existing methods rely on Rh&#8208;catalyzed systems and are somewhat limited in scope. Herein, we disclose the first Ni(0)&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion process that enables the preparation of benzosiloles possessing tetraorganosilicon stereocenters in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The presented catalysis strategy is further applied to the asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic bis&#8208;silicon&#8208;bridged &#960;&#8208;extended systems. Preliminary studies reveal that such compounds exhibit pronounced fluorescence emission, Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance anode materials for potassium&#8208;based energy storage devices with long&#8208;term cyclability requires combined innovations from rational material design to electrolyte optimization. In this work, three&#8208;dimensional K  +  &#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  MXene with enlarged interlayer distance has been constructed for efficient electrochemical potassium&#8208;ion storage. We found that the optimized solvation structure of the concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolyte leads to the formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the K  +  &#8208;pre&#8208;intercalated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  electrode, which is beneficial for interfacial stability and reaction kinetics. As a proof of concept, 3D K  +  &#8208;Ti  3  C  2  T  x  //activated carbon (AC) potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have been assembled and exhibited promising electrochemical performances.

         <title>Inhibition of autophagy by a small molecule through covalent modification of LC3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The autophagic ubiquitin&#8208;like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3&#8208;interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy. Post&#8208;translational modifications like acetylation of Lys49 on the LIR&#8208;interacting surface could disrupt the interaction, offering an opportunity to design covalent small molecules interfering the interface. Through screening covalent compounds, we discover a small molecule modulator of LC3A/B that covalently modifies LC3A/B protein at Lys49. Activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) based evaluations reveal that a derivative molecule DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 exhibits a potent covalent reactivity and selectivity to LC3A/B in HeLa cells. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 compromises LC3B lipidation in vitro and in HeLa cells, leading to deficiency in the formation of autophagic structures and autophagic substrate degradation. DC&#8208;LC3in&#8208;D5 could serve as a powerful tool for autophagy research as well as for therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Asymmetric Charge Distribution of Active Centers in Conjugated Polymers for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active center reconstruction is essential for searching high performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Usually, the ORR activity stems from the special electronic environment of active sites through charge redistribution. In this work, we introduce &#8220;asymmetry&#8221; strategy to adjust the charge distribution of active centers by precisely designing conjugated polymer (CP) catalysts with different degrees of asymmetry. We synthesized asymmetric backbone CP (  asy&#8208;PB  ) by modifying boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bonds (B&#8592;N) and asymmetric sidechain CP (  asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A  ) with different alkyl chain lengths. As a result, both CPs with backbone and sidechain asymmetry exhibit superior ORR performance to their symmetric counterparts (  sy&#8208;P  and  sy&#8208;PB  ). Interestingly,  asy&#8208;PB  with greater asymmetry degree shows higher catalytic activity than  asy&#8208;PB&#8208;A  with relatively smaller asymmetry. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by asymmetric structure endows the center carbon atom of bipyridine with efficient catalytic activity. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of asymmetric ORR active structures and this approach gives a new strategy to design high&#8208;performance non&#8208;metal electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Control of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Cage via the Dissymmetrical Modulation of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature as well as life systems, the presence of asymmetrical and dissymmetrical structures with specific functions is extremely common. However, the construction of metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies based on dissymmetrical ligands still remains a considerable challenge for avoiding the generation of unexpected isomers with similar thermodynamic stabilities, especially for three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structures. In this study, a strategy for the conformational control of metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages via the enhancement of ligand dissymmetry was proposed. Four dissymmetrical ditopic ligands were designed and synthesized. By increasing the dissymmetry of length or angle, conformations of assemblies were precisely controlled to form discrete  cis  &#8208;  Pd  n  L  2n  molecular cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Main Descriptors to correlate structures with performances of electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen/oxygen redox catalysis, which involves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, is crucial in determining the electrochemical performance of energy conversion and storage devices, such as water electrolysis, fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Traditional trial and error approaches to search for catalysts with high activity and stability are typically tedious and inefficient. The progress from these approaches to the rational design principle of catalysts is of great significance. To develop reasonable design strategies for catalytic materials, identifying the most important parameters in determining the catalytic performance is urgently required. The central issue is the energy scaling relationships and their derivatives&#8208;volcano plot, which facilitates the quantitative understanding of catalytic trends. In the past decades, several descriptors have been developed to unravel the structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this review, we summarize reactivity descriptors in electrocatalysis including adsorption energy descriptors involving reaction intermediates, electronic descriptors represented by a d&#8208;band center, structural descriptors, and universal descriptors, and discuss their merits/limitations. Understanding of the trends of the existing electrocatalytic performance and prediction of promising catalytic materials using reactivity descriptors should enable the rational construction of catalysts. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are expectedly adopted to discover new and advanced descriptors. Finally, we analyze the nature of linear scaling relationships and propose several strategies to circumvent or bypass the established scaling relationships to overcome the constraints imposed on the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Doped SnS2 Nanoflowers for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With ever&#8208;increasing energy consumption and continuous rise in atmospheric CO  2  concentration, electrochemical reduction of CO  2  into chemicals/fuels is becoming a promising yet challenging solution. Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as attractive electrocatalysts for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) to formate but suffer from insufficient selectivity and activity, especially at large cathodic current densities. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu&#8208;doped SnS  2  nanoflowers can undergo  in situ  dynamic restructuring to generate catalytically active S&#8208;doped Cu/Sn alloy for highly selective electrochemical CO  2  RR to formate over a wide potential window. Theoretical thermodynamic analysis of reaction energetics indicates that the optimal electronic structure of the Sn active site can be regulated by both S&#8208;doping and Cu&#8208;alloying to favor formate formation, while the CO and H  2  pathways will be suppressed. Our findings provide a rational strategy on electronic modulation of metal active site(s) for designing active and selective electrocatalysts towards CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylation of Alkenes towards 1,4&#8208;Diketones via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl compounds are intriguing motifs and versatile precursors in numerous pharmaceutical molecules and bioactive natural compounds. Direct incorporation of  two  carbonyl groups into a double bond at both ends is straightforward but extremely challengeable. Represented herein is the first example of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes by photocatalysis. Key to success is that N(  n  &#8208;Bu)  4  +  not only associates with alkyl anion to avoid protonation but also activates  &#945;  &#8208;keto acid to undergo electrophilic addition, where  &#945;  &#8208;keto acid is employed both for acyl generation and electrophilic addition. By tuning the reductive and electrophilic ability of acyl precursor, unsymmetric 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation is achieved. This metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;neutral and regioselective 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylation of alkenes is executed only by a photocatalyst for versatile substrates under extremely mild condition that is appealing to great application prospect in biomolecular and drug molecular derivatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Resistive Switching Behavior through Embedding D&#8210;A System into 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new materials for the fabrication of resistive random access memory is of great significance in this period of big data. Here, we present a novel design strategy of embedding donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments into imine&#8208;linked frameworks to construct resistive switching covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for high&#8208;performance memristor. Following such strategy, two D&#8210;A type two&#8208;dimensional COFs, COF  &#8208;BT&#8208;TT  and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT  , were designed and synthesized using conventional solvothermal approach. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF thin films were deposited on ITO substrate with controllable thickness, and exhibited great potential in memristor as an active layer. The rewritable memristor based on 100 nm thick COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;BT  and COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;TVT  film showed a high ON/OFF current ratio of ~10^5  and 10^4  , and low driving voltage of 1.30 and 1.60 V, respectively. More importantly, the cycle period and retention time for COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;BT  based rewriteable devices were as high as 319 cycles and 3.3 x 10^4  s at a constant voltage of 0.1 V, respectively, which were twice than those of COF  &#8208;TT&#8208;TVT  memristor (160 cycles, 1.2 x 10^4  s). This work potentially provides a novel strategy to construct COF materials for highly efficient and stable nonvolatile memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Evidence on the Mechanism of Methane Conversion under Non&#8208;oxidative Conditions over Iron&#8208;modified Silica: The Role of Propargyl Radicals Unveiled</title>

The complex gas&#8208;phase reaction network present during methane conversion under non&#8208;oxidative conditions over iron&#8208;modified silica is unraveled, shedding light on the formation mechanism of C2+ hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated gas&#8208;phase reactions play an important role in the conversion of methane under non&#8208;oxidative conditions into olefins and aromatics over iron&#8208;modified silica catalysts. Herein, we use operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to disentangle the elusive C2+ radical intermediates participating in the complex gas&#8208;phase reaction network. Our experiments pinpoint different C2&#8208;C5 radical species that allow for a stepwise growth of the hydrocarbon chains. Propargyl radicals (H2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;H) are identified as essential precursors for the formation of aromatics, which then contribute to the formation of heavier hydrocarbon products via hydrogen abstraction&#8211;acetylene addition routes (HACA mechanism). These results provide comprehensive mechanistic insights that are relevant for the development of methane valorization processes.

         <title>Interfaces and Interfacial Layers in Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the recent developments on interfaces in inorganic perovskite solar cells, with special focus on the fundamental understanding of how interfaces influence the performance of devices. Directions for developing highly efficient and stable inorganic perovskite solar cells by interface engineering are also provided.







Abstract
Owing to their superior thermal stability, metal halide inorganic perovskite materials continue to attract interest for photovoltaics applications. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) for solar cells based on inorganic perovskites is over 20&#8201;%. As this PCE corresponds to 73&#8201;% of the theoretical limit, there remains more room for further improving the device PCEs than for improving organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The main loss is in the photovoltage, which is limited by interfaces in terms of non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by traps and energy&#8208;level mismatch. Furthermore, inefficient charge extraction at interfacial contacts reduces the photocurrent and fill factor. This Minireview summarizes the recent developments in the fundamental understanding of how the interfaces and interfacial layers influence the performance of solar cells based on inorganic perovskite absorbers. An outlook for the development of highly efficient and stable inorganic PSCs from the interface point of view is also given.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity NIR&#8208;II Multiplexed Lifetime Bioimaging with Bright Double Interfaced Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface nanoparticles with resembled strong fluorescence intensity and differentiable fluorescence lifetimes for high&#8208;fidelity in vivo lifetime multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging provides more possibility of in vivo multiplexing in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. However, it still faces the obstacle that fluorescent probes with differentiable lifetime often exhibit quite different fluorescence intensity, especially the short lifetime usually accompanies with a weak fluorescence intensity, resulting in the difficulty for simultaneously decoding multiplexed lifetime information due to the interference of background noise. To facilitate high&#8208;fidelity lifetime multiplexed imaging, we developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface fluorescent nanoprobes (Er&#8208;DINPs): &#945;&#8208;NaYF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYbF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYF4 with strong fluorescence intensity and easily distinguishable fluorescence lifetime. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results confirmed the advantage of these probes with comparable fluorescence intensity for high&#8208;fidelity multiplexed lifetime bioimaging.

         <title>Redox Ladder of Ni3 Complexes with Closed&#8208;Shell, Mono&#8208;, and Diradical Triphenylene Units: Molecular Models for Conductive 2D MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin coupling and electronic delocalization in trinickel clusters bridged by the radical&#8208;containing tritopic ligand 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP) was investigated. The HOTP spin state and strength of Ni&#8208;HOTP magnetic coupling can be tuned by consecutive HOTP&#8208;centered redox processes. The results provide inspiration for the design of new molecular and solid&#8208;state magnetic and electrically conductive materials.







Abstract
We report the isolation and characterization of a series of trinickel complexes with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP), [(Me3TPANi)3(HOTP)](BF4)n (Me3TPA=N,N,N&#8208;tris[(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]amine) (n=2, 3, 4 for complexes 1, 2, 3). These complexes comprise a redox ladder whereby the HOTP core displays increasingly quinoidal character as its formal oxidation state changes from &#8722;4, to &#8722;3, and &#8722;2 in 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No formal oxidation state changes occur on Ni, allowing the isolation of singlet diradical, monoradical, and closed&#8208;shell configurations for HOTP in 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in the spin coupling strength upon oxidation. Because the three complexes can be considered models of the smallest building blocks of 2D conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks such as Ni9HOTP4, these results serve as possible inspiration for the construction of extended materials with targeted electric and magnetic properties.

         <title>Controlling Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Using Multiplexed Conditional Guide RNAs for Cas12a**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditional processing of Pol&#8201;II&#8208;transcribed Cas12a gRNAs for gene activation using three different activation modalities was achieved: RISC&#8208;based cleavage, an aptazyme, and an RNA strand displacement mechanism. Several switchable guide RNAs along with Cas12a itself can be integrated on a single transcript using a stabilizing triplex motif.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of the activity of CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) proteins is of considerable interest for basic research and therapeutics. Here, we show that conditional guide RNAs (gRNAs) for Cas12a can be transcribed in mammalian cells by RNA polymerase II, followed by activation via input&#8208;dependent processing of the 3&#8242; tail of the gRNA transcript. We demonstrate processing using an RNA strand displacement mechanism, as well as microRNA&#8208;dependent processing, and cleavage by a guanine&#8208;responsive ribozyme. We further demonstrate that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be compactly integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards Cas12a&#8208;based gene regulation constructs with multi&#8208;input switching capabilities. The principle is shown to work in HEK and mouse fibroblast cells using luminescence, fluorescence, and is also demonstrated for the conditional upregulation of an endogenous gene.

         <title>Dichloro Butenediamides as Irreversible Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maleic acid derivatives are studied as cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability to existing reagents. A novel mechanism is described to readily access stable chloro&#8208;maleamic acid. The mild conditions, fast kinetics, and irreversible conjugation make this method an appealing alternative to existing cysteine&#8208;targeted methods.







Abstract
We describe maleic&#8208;acid derivatives as robust cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability relative to maleimides. Diamide and amido&#8208;ester derivatives proved to be efficient protein&#8208;labelling species with a common mechanism in which a spontaneous cyclization occurs upon addition to cysteine. Introduction of chlorine atoms in their structures triggers ring hydrolysis or further conjugation with adjacent residues, which results in conjugates that are completely resistant to retro&#8208;Michael reactions in the presence of biological thiols and human plasma. By controlling the microenvironment of the reactive site, we can control selectivity towards the hydrolytic pathway, forming homogeneous conjugates. The method is applicable to several scaffolds and enables conjugation of different payloads. The synthetic accessibility of these reagents and the mild conditions required for fast and complete conjugation together with the superior stability of the conjugates make this strategy an important alternative to maleimides in bioconjugation.

         <title>Mechanical Force for the Transformation of Aziridine into Imine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine is incorporated into a macromolecular backbone, it undergoes structural transformation into an imine by mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migration of the N&#8208;phthalimido group. The migration occurs under mechanochemical conditions but not thermal conditions. The imine is further hydrolyzed in the presence of water under ambient conditions, resulting in an amine and aldehyde.







Abstract
Force&#8208;selective mechanochemical reactions may be important for applications in polymer mechanochemistry, yet it is difficult to achieve such reactions. This paper reports that cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine incorporated into a macromolecular backbone undergoes migration of N&#8208;phthalimido group to afford imine under mechanochemical condition and not thermal one. The imine is further hydrolyzed by water bifurcating into amine and aldehyde. These structural transformations are confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopic analyses. Computational simulations are conducted for the aziridine mechanophore to propose the mechanism of reaction and define the substrate scope of reaction.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybridization Engineering of Polyperylenediimide Cathodes for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx is smartly designed and exhibits superb potassium&#8208;storage properties, thanks to its unique properties including abundant contactable active sites, Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, electronic polarization, and strong coordination interactions, as shown by detailed experiments and theoretical calculations/simulations.







Abstract
Polyperylenediimide (PDI) is always subject to its modest conductivities, limited reversible active sites and inferior stability for potassium storage. To address these issues, herein, we firstly propose an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid (PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx), where Fe/Sn single atoms are bound to the N&#8208;doped MXenes (N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) via the unsaturated Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, and functionalized with PDI via d&#8211;&#960; hybridization, forming a high conjugated &#948; skeleton. The resulted hybrid cathode endowed with enhanced electronic/ionic conductivities, lowered dissociation barriers of multiple redox centers and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase layer displays a 14&#8208;electron involved high&#8208;rate capacities and long cycle life. Moreover, it shows competitive performance in full cells even under different folding states and low operating temperatures.

         <title>Noncovalent CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions in Phosphoramidite Palladium(II) Complexes with Strong Conformational Preference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak noncovalent interactions and flexibility of ligands play a key role in enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In transition metal complexes and their catalytic applications, the experimental assessment and the design of key interactions is as difficult as the prediction of the enantioselectivities, especially for flexible, privileged ligands such as chiral phosphoramidites. Therefore, the interligand interactions in cis&#8208;Pd(II)L2Cl2 phosphoramidite complexes were investigated by NMR and computations. We were able to induce a strong conformational preference by breaking the symmetry of the C2&#8208;symmetric ligand side chain of one of the ligands, and shift the equilibrium between hetero&#8208; and homocomplexes towards heterocomplexes because of interligand interactions in the cis&#8208;complexes. The modulation of aryl substituents was exploited, along with the solvent effect. The combined CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions reveal design patterns for binding and folding of chiral ligands and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 1H&#945; NMR methods to reveal functionally relevant proline cis/trans isomers in IDPs: characterization of minor forms, effects of phosphorylation and occurrence in proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identification of proline  cis/trans  isomers appearing in several regulatory mechanisms of proteins and characterization of minor species present due to the conformational heterogeneity in IDPs is highly important. To obtain residue level information on these mobile systems we introduce two  1  H  &#945;  &#8208;detected, proline selective, real&#8208;time homodecoupled NMR experiments and analyze the proline abundant transactivation domain of p53. The measurements are sensitive enough to identify minor conformers present in 4&#8208;15% amounts, moreover we show the consequences of CK2 phosphorylation on the  cis/trans  &#8208;proline equilibrium. Using our results and available literature data we perform a statistical analysis on how the amino acid type effects the  cis/trans  proline distribution. The methods are applicable under physiological conditions, and they can contribute to find key proline isomers in proteins and statistical analysis results may help in amino acid sequence optimization for biotechnological purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;copper/cobalt hybrids via Lewis acidic molten salts etching for high performance symmetric supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes have attracted great interests as supercapacitors due to their metallic conductivity, high density, and hydrophilic nature. Herein we report Ti3C2&#8208;Cu/Co hybrids via molten salt etching in which the existence of metal atoms and their interactions with MXene via surficial O atoms were elucidated by XAFS for the first time. The electrochemical investigation of Ti3C2&#8208;Cu electrode demonstrated the pseudocapacitive contribution of Cu and a splendid specific capacitance of 885.0 F g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 in 1.0 M H2SO4. Symmetric supercapacitor Ti3C2&#8208;Cu//Ti3C2&#8208;Cu was demonstrated with operating voltage of 1.6 V, areal capacitance of 290.5 mF cm&#8208;2 at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, and stability over 10000 cycles. It delivered an areal energy density of 103.3 &#956;Wh cm&#8208;2 at power density of 0.8 mW cm&#8208;2, based on which a supercapacitor pouch was fabricated. It provides deeper insights into the molten salt mechanism and strategies for designing MXene&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Conformational Distribution in Amorphous Film of Organic Emitter and Its Application in &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conformational distributions and mutual interconversions of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters significantly affect the exciton utlization. However, their influence of photophysics in amorphous film states are still underdevelopment due to the lack of a suitable quantitative analysis method. Herein, by using temperature dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we quantitatively measured the relative populations of the conformations of a TADF emitter for the first time which not only help deepen the understanding of conformational distributions of TADF emitters, but also provide an aspect to analyze the overall properties of organic amorphous films for other applications. In terms of conformational distribution aspect, we further propose a new concept of &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; for realizing high&#8208;efficiency nondoped OLEDs. Interestingly, this &#8220;compositionally&#8221; pure film actually behaves as a film with dopant (quasi&#8208;equatorial form) in a matrix (quasi&#8208;axial form). The concentration&#8208;induced quenching that may seriously occur at high concentrations is thus expected to be effectively relieved. The &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; OLED by using newly developed TADF emitter TP2P&#8208;PXZ as a neat emitting layer, realizes a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4% and neglectable efficiency roll&#8208;off. This demonstrates high&#8208;performance in doped OLEDs can indeed be achieved with the present &#8220;self&#8208;doping&#8221; emitting layer based on one single compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Repurposing &#960; Electrophilic Cyclization/Dealkylation for Group Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free regio&#8208; and stereocontrolled group&#8208;transfer route toward the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes is described. In this route, an electrophilic heterocyclization is followed by ring&#8208;opening group transfer. Specifically, a thioboration reaction transforms readily available alkynyl sulfide precursors into alkenyl boronates and alkenyl sulfides with defined regio&#8208; and stereochemistry in one synthetic step using commercially available  B&#8208;  chlorocatecholborane (ClBcat). Mechanistic studies identified the likely pathway as proceeding through zwitterionic rather than haloborated intermediates. The regio&#8208; and stereochemistry set in the initial cyclization step is preserved in the final acyclic alkene product, producing alkenes with up to four modifiable substituents with predictable regio&#8208; and stereochemistry. Downstream functionalization reactions showcase the versatility of the substitutions of the resulting alkenes. The mechanistic concept maps onto future reaction designs, given the abundance of known electrophiles and nucleophiles for electrophilic heterocyclization/dealkylation sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;based electron donators to stabilize and activate ultrafine Pt nanoparticles for efficient hydrogen atom dissociation and gas evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum (Pt) is the most effective bench&#8208;marked catalyst for producing renewable and clean hydrogen energy by electrochemical water splitting. There is demand for high HER catalytic activity to achieve efficient utilization and minimize the loading of Pt in catalysts.  In this work, we significantly boost  the HER mass activity of Pt nanoparticles in  Pt  x  /Co to 8.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C by using Co/NC heterojunctions as a heterogeneous version of electron donors. The highly coupled interfaces between Co/NC and Pt metal enrich the electron density of Pt nanoparticles to facilitate the adsorption of H  +  , the dissociation of Pt&#8208;H bonds and H  2  release, giving the lowest HER overpotential of 6.9 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm  2  in acid among reported HER electrocatalysts. Given the easy scale&#8208;up synthesis due to the stabilization of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles by Co/NC solid ligands,  Pt  x  /Co  can even be a promising substitute for commercial Pt/C for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We anticipate high&#8208;valent metal fluoride species will be highly effective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) oxidants because of the magnitude of the H&#8211;F bond (in the product) that drives HAT oxidation. We prepared a dimeric Fe  III  (F)&#8211;F&#8211;Fe  III  (F) complex (  1  ) by reacting [Fe  II  (NCCH  3  )  2  (TPA)](ClO  4  )  2  (TPA = tris&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) with difluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;  3  &#8208;iodane (difluoroiodobenzene).  1  was a sluggish oxidant, however, it was readily activated by reaction with Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids to yield a monomeric [Fe  III  (TPA)(F)(X)]  +  complex (  2  ) where X = F/OTf.  1  and  2  were characterised using NMR, EPR, UV&#8208;vis, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry.  2  was a remarkably reactive Fe  III  reagent for oxidative C&#8211;H activation, demonstrating reaction rates for hydrocarbon HAT comparable to the most reactive Fe  III  and  Fe  IV  oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Perfluorinated Covalent Triazine Frameworks Derived from&#160;a Low&#8208;Temperature Ionothermal&#160;Approach Towards Enhanced&#160;CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluorinated covalent triazine frameworks (F&#8208;CTFs) have shown unique features and attractive performance in separation and catalysis. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;art F&#8208;CTFs synthesized via the ZnCl  2  &#8208;promoted procedure have quite low fluorine contents due to C&#8208;F bond cleavage induced by chloride (a Lewis base) and the harsh conditions deployed (400&#8208;700 &#176;C). Fabricating F&#8208;CTFs with high fluorine contents (&gt; 30 wt%) remains challenging. Herein, we present a low&#8208;temperature ionothermal approach (275 &#176;C) to prepare F&#8208;CTFs, which is achieved via polymerization of tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile (TFPN) over the Lewis superacids, e.g., zinc triflimide [Zn(NTf  2  )  2  ] without side reactions. With low catalyst loading (equimolar), F&#8208;CTFs are afforded with high fluorine content (31 wt%), surface area up to 367 m  2  g  &#8208;1  , and micropores around 1.1 nm. The highly hydrophobic F&#8208;CTF&#8208;1 exhibits good capability to boost electroreduction of CO  2  to CO, with faradaic efficiency of 95.7% at &#8722;0.8 V and high current density (&#8722;141 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) surpassing most of the metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Effect on the Improved Sodium Storage Performance of N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of electrode material is correlated with the choice of electrolyte, however, how the solvation has significant impact on electrochemical behavior is underdeveloped. Herein, N&#8208;heteropentacenequinone (TAPQ) is investigated to reveal the solvation effect on the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries in different electrolyte environment. TAPQ cycled in diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior electrochemical performance, but experiences a rapid capacity fading in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure. By revealing the failure mechanism, this work presents an avenue for better understanding electrochemical behavior and enhancing performance from the angle of solvation effect.</dc:description>

The function of solvation effect is mainly embodied in two aspects: one is the stabilization of anion intermediate via the compatibility of electrode and electrolyte, the other is the interfacial electrochemical characteristics influenced by solvation sheath structure. By revealing the failure mechanism, this work presents an avenue for better understanding electrochemical behavior and enhancing performance from the angle of solvation effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Benzothiophene Synthesis via Enantiospecific Coupling of Benzothiophene S&#8208;Oxides with Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzothiophenes are valuable heterocycles that are widely used in medicines, agrochemicals, and materials science. Herein, we report a general method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2,3&#8208;disubstituted benzothiophenes via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C2&#8208;alkylation of benzothiophenes with boronic esters. The reactions utilize benzothiophene  S  &#8208;oxides in lithiation&#8211;borylations to generate intermediate arylboronate complexes, and subsequent Tf  2  O&#8208;promoted S&#8722;O bond cleavage to trigger a Pummerer&#8208;type 1,2&#8208;metalate shift, which gives the coupled products with complete enantiospecificity. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl boronic esters and aryl boronic esters are successfully coupled with a range of C3&#8208;substituted benzothiophenes. Importantly, this transformation does not require the use of C3 directing groups, therefore it overcomes a major limitation of previously developed transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated C2 alkylations of benzothiophenes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carboline (TH&#946;C) is not only a prevailing structural feature of many natural alkaloids but also a versatile synthetic precursor for a vast array of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. Asymmetric synthesis of C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs remains rarely explored and challenging. Herein, we describe the development of the two complementary approaches for the catalytic asymmetric alkynylation of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ions with up to 96% yield and 99%  ee  . The utility of chiral C1&#8208;alkynyl TH&#946;Cs was demonstrated by the collective total syntheses of seven indole alkaloids: harmicine, eburnamonine, desethyleburnamonine, larutensine, geissoschizol, geissochizine, and akuammicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxy Radical&#8208;induced Formation of Dual&#8208;Layered Protection Film for High&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The uncontrollable dendrite growth of Li metal anode leads to poor cycle stability and safety concerns, hindering its utilization in high energy density batteries. Herein, a phenoxy radical Spiro&#8208;O8 is proposed as an artificial protection film for Li metal anode owing to its excellent film&#8208;forming capability and remarkable ionic conductivity. A spontaneous redox reaction between the Spiro&#8208;O8 and Li metal results in the formation of a uniform and highly ionic conductive organic film in the bottom. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radicals on surface of Spiro&#8208;O8 facilitate the decomposition of Li salt upon exposed to the ether electrolyte and lead the formation of LiF film on the top. Arising from the synergistic effects of inner high ionic&#160;conductive film and outer rigid film, stable Li plating/stripping can be realized at a high current density (4000 cycles at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and a high areal capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8208;2  for 550 h with an ultrahigh Li utilization rate of 54.6%. As a proof of concept, this work shows a facile strategy to rationally fabricate dual&#8208;layered interfaces for Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition Mechanism of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease with Ketone&#8208;Based Inhibitors Unveiled by Multiscale Simulations.  Insights for Improved Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the results of classical and QM/MM simulations for the inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 3CL protease by a hydroxymethylketone inhibitor, PF&#8208;00835231. In the noncovalent complex the carbonyl oxygen atom of the warhead is placed in the oxyanion hole formed by residues 143 to 145, while P1&#8208;P3 groups are accommodated in the active site with similar interactions to those observed for the peptide substrate. According to alchemical free energy calculations, the P1&#8217; hydroxymethyl group also contributes to the binding free energy. Covalent inhibition of the enzyme is triggered by the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. This step is followed by the nucleophilic attack of the S&#947; atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor and a proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom mediated by the P1&#8217; hydroxyl group. Computational simulations show that the addition of a methylchloride substituent to the P1&#8217; group may lower the activation free energy for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropanes are an important class of building blocks in organic synthesis. Herein, a ring&#8208;opening/arylcarboxylation/acylation cascade reaction for the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes enabled by cooperative NHC and organophotoredox catalysis is reported. The cascade works on monosubstituted cyclopropanes that are in contrast to the heavily investigated donor/acceptor cyclopropanes more challenging to be difunctionalized. The key step is a radical/radical cross coupling of a benzylic radical generated in the photoredox catalysis cycle with a ketyl radical from the NHC catalysis cycle. The transformation features metal&#8208;free reaction conditions and tolerates a diverse range of functionalities.</dc:description>
