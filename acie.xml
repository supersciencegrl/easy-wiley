         <title>Orchestrating Penta&#8208;Element Interplay in Gradient&#8208;Porous Carbons for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the active sites induced by promete and the Na+ storage capacity as well as anion adsorption/desorption has been established through a combination of electrochemical analysis, machine learning potentials, and molecular dynamics simulations, which enhances the kinetics and capacity balance of anode and cathode for sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) offer a cutting&#8208;edge synergy between battery&#8208;level energy density and supercapacitor&#8208;like power density, yet face critical challenges in balancing the kinetic and capacity mismatch between Faradaic anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we present a penta&#8208;element doped gradient&#8208;porous carbon (PE&#8208;GPC) with a nanosphere architecture, engineered with high&#8208;entropy principles and a gradual pore density variation to enhance mass transport and charge storage. Operando spectroscopy and machine learning potentials unveil a concerted penta&#8208;element interplay: thiophene&#8208;like S configurations mediate dynamic redox processes, enabling pseudocapacitive Na&#8314; and anion storage, while fluorine functionalities foster a self&#8208;rejuvenating NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), stabilizing long&#8208;term cycling. Meanwhile, the synergistic N/B/P triad engineers a hierarchical defect network that enhances electronic conductivity and fine&#8208;tunes ion adsorption energetics. This orchestrated interplay empowers the SIHC full cell with a high energy density of 196&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a formidable power density (10.4&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1), and an impressive 88.2% capacity retention after 9000 cycles. By establishing a high&#8208;entropy stabilization paradigm, this work paves the way for multi&#8208;ion storage architectures, offering a universal strategy to bridge the charge&#8208;transfer imbalance in advanced energy devices.

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of oxygen&#8208;doped graphene nanoribbons (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR) were synthesized on Au(111) via in situ formation of pyrans. Both O&#8208;doped GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors but exhibit different sensitivities to oxygen dopants, which is attributed to the difference in the density of states near the Fermi level between the substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts.








Abstract
Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.

         <title>Unlocking Dual Recycling in Photo&#8208;Curable Polycyanurate Thermosets Derived from Bio&#8208;Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway recycling strategy for polycyanurate thermosets is presented. The thermosets are prepared by curing a bio&#8208;derived eugenol&#8208;based triazine monomer with various dithiols via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization. Recyclability is enabled through two distinct SNAr&#8208;based depolymerization approaches: selective monomer recovery and closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. The recycled materials retain their original performance.








Abstract
Polycyanurate thermosets are extensively utilized in high&#8208;performance applications due to their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, their inherently crosslinked nature has traditionally rendered them nonrecyclable, limiting their sustainability. Recent studies have demonstrated that these networks can undergo dynamic rearrangement under specific conditions, enabling reversibility. In this study, a bio&#8208;derived cyanurate monomer from eugenol was synthesized and polymerized via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization, yielding recyclable polycyanurate thermosets with robust material properties. The dynamic character of these networks was leveraged through nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) chemistry, unlocking two distinct recycling pathways: i) selective monomer recovery and ii) closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. Depolymerization in the presence of eugenol enabled the selective recovery of well&#8208;defined monomeric components, while phenol&#8208;mediated cleavage facilitated polymer breakdown into chemically recyclable intermediates, which were directly reassembled into reformed thermosets. Both recycling pathways resulted in regenerated polymers that retained their original thermal, mechanical, and thermomechanical properties, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of this approach. By establishing a controlled depolymerization and reassembly framework, this study introduces a sustainable design strategy for achieving closed&#8208;loop recycling in high&#8208;performance thermosets, providing a scalable pathway toward circular polymer materials.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Defect Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tandem CO2 Electroreduction and Carbonylation Reactions from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;system tandem approach&#8212;comprising a membrane separation CO&#8322; system, a CO&#8322; reduction reaction system, and a carbonylation reaction system&#8212;directly converts flue gas to high&#8208;value&#8208;added organic chemicals, establishing a practical paradigm for sustainable chemical manufacturing that simultaneously addresses challenges in carbon capture, renewable energy storage, and green synthesis of fine chemicals. 








Abstract
Tandem CO2 reduction with carbonylation reactions represents a promising approach to convert greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;N/O mixed pre&#8208;coordination pyrolysis&#8221; strategy to construct vacancy&#8208;defect single atom catalysts (Ni1&#8208;, Mn1&#8208;, Fe1&#8208;, Co1&#8208;, and Cu1&#8208;NC) with M&#8208;N3 coordination microenvironment. This vacancy&#8208;defect endows Ni1&#8208;NC with excellent performance for CO2 electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13&#160;g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO2 system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly method for CO2 separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.

PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, and expose abundant zigzag edges, which contribute to the higher catalytic activity for HER. The as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent HER activity at extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8211;2.0&#160;nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.

         <title>Tunable Endo/Exo Selectivity in Direct Catalytic Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions with Polyfunctional Lewis Acid / Azolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept for catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with iminoesters employs modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide betaine catalysts, controlling endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selectivity through adjustments of metal center, azolium, and sterics. DFT studies reveal an almost perfect spatial fit of functional sites, enabling precise orchestration of the catalytically relevant moieties involved&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions (1,3&#8208;DCA) using iminoesters as ylide precursors offer a powerful approach to accessing stereochemically complex, biologically relevant pyrrolidines. Although previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3&#8208;DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both endo (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging exo products (TON up to 1500). This approach, making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide catalysts, allows for precise control over endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The switch from endo&#8208; to exo&#8208;selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety, and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps. However, they also precisely orchestrate and accelerate all accompanying transformations&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic machineries.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on a Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A calix[4]resorcinarene&#8208;based molecular cage featuring a large [6&#160;+&#160;12] octahedral structure has been employed as a single&#8208;molecule junction. The connection between sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups and the gold electrodes and leads to a stable junction with a conductance of 10&#8722;3.5 G0.








Abstract
As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8722;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation, combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an anionic complexation strategy to construct cyanide vacancy&#8208;architected Prussian blue frameworks. Through controlled ligand&#8208;field perturbation, the engineered vacancies activate reversible Fe low&#8208;spin &#8596; high&#8208;spin transitions during cycling, creating adaptive structural accommodation that stabilizes Fe redox centers. This vacancy&#8208;mediated spin&#8208;state engineering establishes a new design paradigm for manipulating electron configuration through defect&#8208;property coupling in coordination materials.








Abstract
Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversial, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller anionic vacancies remains challenging due to the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategies. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with tunable cyanide vacancy concentrations. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which are more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships between cyanide vacancy configurations and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Orbital Coupling&#8208;Engineered Coordination&#8208;Unsaturated CuAg Nanochains Drives Spontaneous Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation and Zn&#8208;C2H2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs) is synthesized for ethylene electrocatalytic production, achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. The orbital coupling between the Cu0.5Ag CNCs catalyst and the C2H2 molecules is enhanced and forms a high *H demand surface, where the acetylene hydrogenation process occurs spontaneously without energy barrier. It provides a new way to realize the orbital coupling engineering of coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalysts.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) offers a mild and sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet it faces critical challenges including competitive C&#9472;C coupling for 1,3&#8208;butadiene due to insufficient proton supply and hydrogen evolution under high current densities. To address these limitations, we design a coordination&#8208;unsaturated CuAg bimetallic catalyst with cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs), which synergistically regulates proton dynamics, maintaining high activity from 0.1 to 0.6 A cm&#8722;2 and achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the introduction of Cu makes the d&#8208;band center in Cu0.5Ag CNCs upshift toward the Fermi level, strengthening orbital coupling with C2H2 and creating a high *H demand surface. In situ spectroscopic and density functional theory analyses demonstrate that coordination&#8208;unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag interfacial sites promote spontaneous C2H2 hydrogenation, especially bypassing formation barriers of *C2H2 and *C2H3. This thermodynamic superiority originates from sufficient proton supply and exothermic *H consumption for C2H2 hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst enables a Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery with a power density of 2.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, showcasing dual functionality in electrosynthesis and energy storage. Our work establishes a paradigm for coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalyst design through orbital coupling engineering, providing atomic&#8208;level insights into proton&#8208;mediated reaction control for sustainable chemical manufacturing.

The orbital coupling between the Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ag CNCs catalyst and the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules is enhanced and forms a high *H demand surface, where the acetylene hydrogenation process occurs spontaneously without energy barrier. It provides a new way to realize the orbital coupling engineering of coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) offers a mild and sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet it faces critical challenges including competitive C&#9472;C coupling for 1,3-butadiene due to insufficient proton supply and hydrogen evolution under high current densities. To address these limitations, we design a coordination-unsaturated CuAg bimetallic catalyst with cross-linked nanochains (Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ag CNCs), which synergistically regulates proton dynamics, maintaining high activity from 0.1 to 0.6 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Mechanistic studies reveal that the introduction of Cu makes the d-band center in Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ag CNCs upshift toward the Fermi level, strengthening orbital coupling with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and creating a high *H demand surface. In situ spectroscopic and density functional theory analyses demonstrate that coordination-unsaturated Cu-Ag interfacial sites promote spontaneous C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation, especially bypassing formation barriers of *C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and *C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This thermodynamic superiority originates from sufficient proton supply and exothermic *H consumption for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst enables a Zn-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with a power density of 2.12&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, showcasing dual functionality in electrosynthesis and energy storage. Our work establishes a paradigm for coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalyst design through orbital coupling engineering, providing atomic-level insights into proton-mediated reaction control for sustainable chemical manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selection of Ribofuranose&#8208;Isomer Among Pentoses by Phosphorylation with Diamidophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate phosphorylates the four pentoses under mild aqueous conditions. Ribofuranosyl&#8208;cyclicphosphates are formed efficiently, while the other three pentoses react slowly to form furanosyl&#8208; and/or pyranosyl&#8208;forms. The selective formation of ribofuranosyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate occurs even when starting from a mixture of sugars suggesting an alternative pathway for abiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides in a prebiotic context.








Abstract
The unique structure&#8211;function relationship of the ribofuranose ring in RNA has inspired various chemical pathways to select for the ribofuranose form (over the ribopyranose form), especially in a prebiotic context. Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses&#8212;ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose&#8212;naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation i) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration toward RNA and ii) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.

         <title>Design Strategies Based on Electronic Interactions for Effective Catalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of effective bidirectional electrocatalyst focused on electronic interactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Development of effective bidirectional catalyst is essential for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The catalytic activity of catalyst is directly related to the degree of the interaction between the catalysts and adsorbates. In the review, we introduce the design strategy for catalysts with high catalytic activity focused on the electronic structure and properties of catalysts and reactants.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density (&gt;500&#160;W h kg&#8722;1). However, LSBs exhibit an unsatisfactory energy density (&lt;400&#160;W h kg&#8722;1) and cycle life (&lt;300 cycles) because of the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and the sluggish conversion reaction kinetics caused by insulating sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Although various types of catalysts, including metal&#8208;based compounds to single&#8208;atom catalysts, have been reported to address these issues, most catalysts exhibited limited catalytic activity under practical lean electrolyte conditions (&lt;5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). A comprehensive understanding of the synthetic strategy and catalytic mechanism of catalysts is essential for their design, but understanding the electronic effects of the catalysts and LiPS is more important. Furthermore, the electronic design of these catalysts is not well understood. In this review, we introduce the catalytic mechanisms in LSBs and discuss catalyst design strategies in terms of electronic effects on the interactions between reactants and catalysts, with a primary focus on heterogeneous catalytic systems. We additionally consider how the electronic property of homogeneous systems, particularly redox mediators, affects catalytic behavior under lean electrolyte conditions and propose future research directions for catalyst development in LSBs.

         <title>Electronic Structure Origins of Distinct Hydrogenation Activities Observed for Linear and Bent Bimetallic &#956;&#8208;Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first research that employs a combination of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations to clearly elucidate the contribution of electronic structure to the distinct hydrogenation reactivity of bent and linear bimetallic nitrides. 








Abstract
Hydrogenation of metal nitrides is of particular interest due to the direct relevance to Haber&#8211;Bosch ammonia synthesis. Notably, for all bi&#8208; and multi&#8208;nuclear bridging nitrides reported thus far, only those featuring bent M&#9472;N&#9472;M cores can react with dihydrogen (H2) and related H2&#8208;derived species, while the vast majority of linear M&#9472;N&#9472;M congeners cannot. Herein, we present a detailed electronic&#8208;structure study of prototypical bimetallic bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides [Cp*FeIV(&#956;&#8208;SEt)2(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIVCp*][PF6] (1, Cp*&#160;=&#160;&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) and [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;N)CoIIICp*] (3, Ad&#160;=&#160;adamantyl) and linear &#956;&#8208;nitride [(TPP)FeIV(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIV(TPP)][PF6] (2, TPP2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato), as well as &#956;&#8208;imide [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;NH)CoIIICp*][BPh4] (4), using various spectroscopic techniques, in particular, 15N solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, coupled with density functional theory calculations. An in&#8208;depth analysis of their distinct 15N shielding tensors revealed that bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides invariably possess a high&#8208;lying proton&#8208;accepting molecular orbital (MO) and a low&#8208;lying electron&#8208;accepting MO. These electronic&#8208;structure features are key to the bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides affecting hydrogenolysis via either two&#8208;electron oxidation of H2 or H2 heterolysis.

&lt;p&gt;This work represents the first research that employs a combination of solid-state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations to clearly elucidate the contribution of electronic structure to the distinct hydrogenation reactivity of bent and linear bimetallic nitrides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogenation of metal nitrides is of particular interest due to the direct relevance to Haber&#8211;Bosch ammonia synthesis. Notably, for all bi- and multi-nuclear bridging nitrides reported thus far, only those featuring bent M&#9472;N&#9472;M cores can react with dihydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and related H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived species, while the vast majority of linear M&#9472;N&#9472;M congeners cannot.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific On&#8208;Site Activation of Cisplatin via Cascade Catalytic&#8208;Redox Reactions for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of cisplatin (cDDP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cDDP in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis for highly efficient chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficiency of platinum drugs is always limited by low utilization, side effects, and Pt&#8208;resistance. Herein, a double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine named PtNP@Cu has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of dechlorinated cisplatin (DP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cisplatin (cDDP) in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis of cancer cells. This design avoids the premature release of active PtII species in normal cells or in the cytoplasm of cancer cells before reaching nucleus, thereby ensuring maximum amplification of Pt&#8208;DNA crosslinking with tumor&#8208;specificity. Meanwhile, substantial GSH depletion and ROS production induced by cascade catalytic&#8208;redox reactions results in ferroptosis of cancer cells, which further reduces GSH&#8208;mediated cDDP detoxification, overcomes Pt&#8208;resistance, and enhances immunogenicity, ultimately realizing highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy and antitumor immunity in vivo. This work provides a new strategy for effectively and comprehensively addressing the issues of low utilization, side effects, and drug resistance problems of platinum drugs, which is also promising for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Unexpected Redox Role of WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 Catalysts for Selective Reduction of NO by Forming V&#8211;W Dinuclear Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NH3&#8208;SCR reaction over V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalyst, WO3 not only serves as an acidic promoter and structural regulator, but also plays a redox role. The WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5.








Abstract
Promoters can greatly improve the activity of catalysts; however, the mechanism by which they interact with the primary catalyst to enhance catalytic activity is not always clear. It has been widely demonstrated that WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts acts as a promoter to enhance the surface acidity and regulate the dispersion of active V2O5 species, while it is believed that the redox process takes place entirely at the V sites in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR). Here, by combining in situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we validate that the WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect in NH3&#8208;SCR by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5. This study sheds new light on a long&#8208;standing puzzle regarding the role of WO3 as a promoter and hence advances the understanding of the working principle of V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Unveiling Zinc Stripping and Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the zinc stripping process is more prone to cause severe side reactions than the deposition process, resulting in the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; In this regard, a dynamic molecular protection strategy is proposed to regulate the zinc stripping and deposition processes simultaneously, achieving long&#8208;lasting protection of the zinc anodes.








Abstract
The unstable zinc anode is a key challenge limiting the cycle life of rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The current research primarily focuses on the zinc plating process, with strategies to induce uniform zinc deposition for a stable zinc anode. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc stripping process has a more significant impact on the subsequent zinc deposition, which exacerbates the formation of by&#8208;products, dendrites, and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; Therefore, we propose using aspartyl&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester (APM) molecules to regulate the zinc stripping, achieving uniform stripping of the zinc anode by increasing the stripping overpotential across high&#8208;energy barriers. Simultaneously, its localized hydrophobic functional groups effectively inhibit the byproducts triggered by solvated water molecules. The experimental results show that the Zn&#8208;APM symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, with stable cycling over 6500&#160;h (&gt;9 months) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 700&#160;h at 70% zinc utilization with 10&#160;&#181;m zinc. In addition, the Zn&#8208;APM||Zn0.58V2O5&#183;H2O full cell exhibits 80% capacity retention after 500 cycles at a loading of 8.1&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Comparative Study of Solvatomorphs of Stryker's Reagent Using MicroED and Quantum Mechanics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvate form of Stryker's reagent was crystallized from benzene which has regular octahedra with equivalent Cu&#8211;Cu interatomic distances. Quantum crystallography approach HAR led to reliable position of hydrides in both the forms. The reported THF solvate form has edge bridging hydrides while the newly discovered form may have both edge and face bridging hydrides supported by structural and topological analysis. 








Abstract
The atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long&#8208;standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it's increased sensitivity toward hydrogen atoms relative to X&#8208;ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker's reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate. Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge&#8208; and face&#8208;bridging hydrides.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered CRISPR/Cas12a for Genomic Editing and Tumor Regression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for gene editing is introduced. The machinery is applied for endogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene editing and for in vitro disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene. The machinery is used for in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors, resulting in effective apoptosis and necrosis of the tumor tissues.








Abstract
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for in vitro and in vivo gene editing is introduced. The system consists of a caged, inactive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl phosphate ester photo&#8208;responsive crRNA, which, upon light&#8208;induced deprotection, yields the active CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing machinery (LAC12aGE). The LAC12aGE system induces specific thymidine&#8208;rich (TTTN) protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;guided double&#8208;stranded breaks in genomic DNA, which upon non&#8208;homologous end&#8208;joining lead to gene repair. The LAC12aGE machinery is applied for gene editing of an exogenous dual fluorescent reporter gene in living cells, as well as the endogenous gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 1. In addition, the LAC12aGE is applied for in vitro gene editing and disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene in HepG2 cells, where knockout of the HGF gene results in inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, the in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors by the LAC12aGE machinery is demonstrated. The cyclic temporal development of the LAC12aGE system in tumors shows effective inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis/necrosis of tumor tissues compared to control systems.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective and Low&#8208;Carbon Scalable Recycling of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate Through Bio&#8208;Based Guaiacol&#8208;Enhanced Methanolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective and low&#8208;carbon PET recycling strategy is developed using bio&#8208;based guaiacol to promote methanolysis through an intermediate stabilizing mechanism. Under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), the system achieves complete PET conversion within 2 h, producing dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG) at yields of 94% and 98%, respectively.








Abstract
The global plastic waste crisis, particularly from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), demands sustainable recycling solutions. PET methanolysis offers a promising route to recover high&#8208;purity dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), but achieving scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly processes under mild conditions remains challenging. This study introduces a bio&#8208;based catalytic system using guaiacol and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), achieving 94% DMT and 98% ethylene glycol (EG) yields within 2 h. Unlike conventional acid&#8208;catalyzed or co&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted methanolysis methods, the phenolic hydroxyl group of guaiacol critically stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. The system demonstrates broad versatility across various polyesters and real&#8208;world PET waste streams, including mixed textiles and colored plastics, while enabling selective depolymerization. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm its low carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and industrial viability. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy offers a sustainable solution for PET recycling, addressing both environmental and economic challenges while advancing resource circularity in the plastic industry.

         <title>Polyphosphorus Ligand Complexes of Coinage Metals for Multiple Capturing of Intact P4 Tetrahedra</title>

Self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 and C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) with coinage metal salts and white phosphorus afforded an unprecedented novel class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes in which metal ions multiply coordinate intact P4 tetrahedra. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the right choice of the solvent tune the structure and the content of P4 in the coordination products that can release P4 upon decomplexation.








Abstract
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 (Cp*, 1a), C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) (CpPEt, 1b)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH3CN)4][SbF6] or AgSbF6 were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered CpR ligand and noncoordinating anions. In the self&#8208;assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P4 tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P4 in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinated cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P4 molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.

         <title>Tuning Local Proton Concentration and *OOH Intermediate Generation for Efficient Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>

Efficient acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was achieved on F&#8208;CNTs with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% at 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure, enhanced nanoconfinement effect and oxygen mass transfer of CNTs, leading to a local alkaline microenvironment and promoted *OOH generation for acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction is a sustainable method for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis. The H2O2 in acidic media has wide downstream applications, but acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from poor efficiency due to high proton concentration and unfavourable *OOH (key intermediate) generation. Herein, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was enhanced by regulating local proton availability and *OOH generation via fluorine&#8208;doped on inner and outer walls of carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs). It was efficient and stable for H2O2 electrosynthesis with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% and H2O2 yield of 606.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 at 1.0 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 0.05&#160;M H2SO4, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure of CNTs with elevated p&#8208;band center, and F&#8208;doping on its inner and outer walls also enhanced nanoconfinement effect and superhydrophobicity, respectively. As a result, a local alkaline microenvironment was created on F&#8208;CNTs surface during acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. The energy barrier for *OOH generation was significantly reduced and oxygen mass transfer was boosted. Their synergistic effects promoted acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. This work provides new insights into the mechanism for regulating H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Chiral Spirobipyridine Synthesis by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition</title>

We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition between bisalkynyl malononitriles and terminal alkynes. Chiral spirobipyridines bearing ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituents can be synthesized with the help of chiral bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.








Abstract
Chiral spirobiindanes are recognized as the privileged structures in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the structurally similar chiral spirobipyridines have not yet been explored as chiral ligands or organocatalysts due to the absence of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of spirobipyridines via double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction. Spirobipyridines with ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents could be obtained with exclusive regioselectivity and up to 99% ee in the presence of cobalt and bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Spirobipyridines coordinate with transition metals as chiral ligands. Spirobipyridine dioxides can be applied as chiral organocatalysts in the asymmetric allylation of aldehydes.

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled occlusion of polymeric nanoparticles into cuprous oxide (Cu2O) systematically alters lattice distortion, oxygen vacancy content, and catalytic efficiency in the resulting composite crystals, offering a robust framework for the development of advanced functional composite materials.








Abstract
Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in a spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from the surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.

         <title>Visible Light Excited Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Tuning in Carbon Dots via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the discovery of confining carbon dots (CDs) into boric acid matrix realizing the precise regulation of color from red to white with delay time increase under white light (WL) excitation. And composites can emit persistent afterglow at high temperatures up to 393&#160;K under WL excitation. Its time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) and high stability lay a solid foundation for higher&#8208;order cryptographic and anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons at low energy levels and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation. Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra&#8208;strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperatures of up to 393&#160;K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free and Markovnikov&#8208;type process for divergent hydroboration/multiboration of terminal alkynes has been achieved, enabling the transformation of diverse aryl and alkyl alkynes into valuable but previously inaccessible &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronate, 2,2&#8208;diborylalkane, 1,2,2&#8208;triborylalkane, and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkane with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities by simply modulating the proton additive and solvent.








Abstract
Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high&#8208;value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &#946;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal&#8208;free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates.

     alt="Metal-Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal-free and Markovnikov-type process for divergent hydroboration/multiboration of terminal alkynes has been achieved, enabling the transformation of diverse aryl and alkyl alkynes into valuable but previously inaccessible &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylboronate, 2,2-diborylalkane, 1,2,2-triborylalkane, and 1,2-diborylalkane with excellent regio- and chemoselectivities by simply modulating the proton additive and solvent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high-value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov-type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal-free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-alkenylboronates. Derived from it, we have successfully realized unprecedented tailor-made multiborations (2,2-dihydroboration, 1,2,2-triboration, and 1,2-dihydroboration) of alkynes by simply changing the proton sources and solvents.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enables Fast Charge Dynamics and Hierarchical Active Sites for Two&#8208;Stage Kinetics in Photodegradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation demonstrates an efficient synthetic methodology for the fabrication of atomically dispersed cobalt species anchored on carbon nitride substrate, featuring distinctive asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination environments and hierarchical active sites. The unique electronic structure of this single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits strengthened driving force and boosted charge carrier transport properties, manifesting in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics during the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A contaminants in wastewater.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted growing interest in solar&#8208;driven catalysis, though challenges persist due to symmetrical metal coordination, which results in limited driving force and sluggish charge dynamics. Additionally, uneven energy and mass distribution complicate reaction pathways, ultimately restricting solar energy utilization and catalytic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized cobalt single atoms decorated carbon nitride catalysts featuring a highly asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination, tailored for photocatalytic organic pollutants removal. Advanced experimental studies and simulation results collectively revealed that the unique microenvironment surrounding Co single atoms improved charge dynamics and created reactive hot spots, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species during the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. These enhanced charge dynamics, combined with hierarchical active sites, resulted in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics and excellent stability for the degradation of bisphenol A in wastewater, distinctly outperforming the first&#8208;stage kinetics observed for polymeric carbon nitride. This work advances the understanding of structure&#8208;performance relationships in SAC&#8208;based photocatalytic degradation and offers valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation SACs in environmental catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular TADF Materials from Calix[3]Acridan and Guest&#8208;Linked Polymers for Rapid and Visual Detection of Trace Benzene</title>

         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the rapid and visual detection of trace benzene was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A based on luminescence color change mechanism, and the limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1.

Abstract
In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi&#8208;color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest&#8208;linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi&#8208;color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.

The electrode exhibits outstanding energy output and ultralong cycling stability, offering new opportunities for next&#8208;generation energy storage and desalination technologies.








Abstract
The charge and ion transport dynamics, storage capacity, and cycling performance of Faradaic Cl&#8722; ion storage electrodes have recently constrained advancements in supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI). Herein, a high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF (TAPA&#8208;COF)&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion storage material (TAPArGO) with exceptional cycling stability was synthesized via an in situ condensation reaction utilizing graphene as a conductive substrate. The interfacial coupling involving graphene and TAPA&#8208;COF increases the interfacial electron density, boosting local charge accumulation and Cl&#8722; ion storage capacity. Additionally, the dual conductive strategy of incorporating graphene and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization of TAPA&#8208;COF enhances the redox kinetics, while the triphenylamine N redox centers and flexible graphene network improve cycling stability. Consequently, the Cl&#8722; ion asymmetric SC employing the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode achieves a specific energy output of 52.4 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 950 W kg&#8722;1, with exciting cycling durability retaining 96.8% of the initial capacity after 100&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid CDI system based on the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode demonstrates a specific adsorption capacity of 55.0 mg g&#8722;1, along with remarkable cycling desalination/regeneration ability (99.8% after 200 desalination/regeneration cycles). This study expands the application potential of COF&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;performance Cl&#8722; ion storage.

         <title>Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Mediators for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Element&#8211;Carbon Bond Homolysis in Main Group Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the facilitation of E&#9472;C bond homolysis of main group compounds with visible light by the coordination of redox non&#8208;innocent ligands. Important conceptual coherencies, potential applications, and future challenges are highlighted with respect to selected literature reports.








Abstract
Photoinitiated homolysis of element&#8211;carbon bonds is an important method for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals in catalysis and organometallic or polymer chemistry. In this respect, the use of earth&#8208;abundant main group elements such as aluminum or silicon is attractive. Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox&#8208;inactive elements are unstable and within their high&#8208;valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#9472;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#9472;C homolysis usually requires shortwave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#9472;C homolysis is possible when a redox non&#8208;innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the NILs provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8211;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#9472;C bond. In this article, the effects of NILs as mediators for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#9472;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.

Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox-inactive elements are unstable and within their high-valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#9472;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#9472;C homolysis usually requires shortwave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible-light-induced E&#9472;C homolysis is possible when a redox non-innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the NILs provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8211;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#9472;C bond. In this article, the effects of NILs as mediators for visible-light-induced E&#9472;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theodor F&#246;rster: Life and FRET from 1933 to 1951. A Viewpoint from the Archives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theodor F&#246;rster's name is forever linked to FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) and while his development of FRET theory is well known and recognized, only few is documented about his scientific career and life from 1933 to 1951. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article discusses F&#246;rster's life and career before, during, and after National Socialism in Germany.








Abstract
FRET stands for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. While much is known about resonance energy transfer, much less is known about F&#246;rster&#8211;apart from the fact that he was the one who translated FRET from a theoretical phenomenon into a broadly usable method for investigating and understanding biomolecular interactions on the nanoscale. Arguably, a major reason for the limited recognition of Theodor F&#246;rster is his scientific career during the Nazi time in Germany about which little is documented. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article&#8211;on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death&#8211;sheds some light on F&#246;rster's life from 1933 to 1951 and describes how a young scientist struggled during dark times in history.

The phase separation of self&#8208;assembled hosts in a gel from liquid guests is a convenient approach for heterogeneous encapsulation. In their Communication (e202504207), Dong Yang and co&#8208;workers report a class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates, which can be utilized as filling material in columns and show the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization.

Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers relies on simple, easily accessible building blocks with minimal steric hindrance and strong electron deficiency. Xugang Guo and co&#8208;workers report a quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), in their Research Article (e202501196). The TTD&#8208;based polymers exhibit tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, along with outstanding n&#8208;type thermoelectric performance.

In their Research Article (e202503614), Eugenia Peresypkina, Manfred Scheer et&#160;al. demonstrate that reactive white phosphorus molecules can be captured by a polynuclear silver complex based on pentaphosphaferrocene and controllably released in solution.

Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of challenging cyclic tertiary amines is reported. In their Research Article (e202505275), Svetlana B. Tsogoeva and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt as an efficient organoautocatalyst, enabling double C(sp2)&#8208;N bond metathesis at room temperature via a domino reaction mechanism. This metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free transformation advances green, waste&#8208;reducing, and sustainable approaches in organic synthesis.

         <title>From Binary to Higher&#8208;Order Organic Cocrystals: Design Principles and Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From binary to higher&#8208;order organic cocrystals: strategic design principles, precision synthesis, and multifunctional applications. The emergence of ternary and higher&#8208;order cocrystalline systems, comprising three or more components, has revolutionized the paradigm of material design by significantly expanding both structural diversity and functional potential. These advanced architectures not only exhibit enhanced design versatility through synergistic molecular engineering but also enable unprecedented modulation of physicochemical properties, thereby introducing novel optoelectronic, mechanical, and stimuli&#8208;responsive functionalities.








Abstract
Organic cocrystals, particularly the evolution from binary to higher&#8208;order structures, have garnered considerable attention due to their tunable intermolecular interactions and unique material properties. Binary cocrystals, formed through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, charge transfer, and hydrogen/halogen bonding, allow for precise control over molecular packing and enhanced optoelectronic properties. In contrast, higher&#8208;order cocrystals, incorporating three or more components, enable greater complexity and functional diversity. Strategies such as homologation via isostructural substitution, hierarchical intermolecular interactions, and long&#8208;range Synthon Aufbau Modules facilitate the synthesis of these advanced materials. The shift toward higher&#8208;order cocrystals paves the way for novel applications in fields such as deep learning for cocrystal prediction, drug design, organic solar cells, and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. However, challenges related to molecular screening, ratio optimization, scalable synthesis, and long&#8208;term stability remain critical hurdles for the broader implementation of these materials in practical applications.

         <title>Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic Crystals: Molecular Design and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals have advanced through molecular design (donor&#8208;acceptor structures, &#960;&#8208;conjugation) and crystal engineering to overcome aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and energy gap limitations. Featuring high quantum yields, tunable deep&#8208;red/NIR emission, and flexibility, they enable applications in flexible waveguides, lasers, and bio&#8208;integrated optoelectronics.








Abstract
Red&#8208;emissive organic materials play a pivotal role in optoelectronics, including displays, optical communications, organic lasers, and biomedicine, owing to their high penetration and low scattering properties. However, conventional polymer and thin&#8208;film emitters often face efficiency losses at long wavelengths and limited operational stability. Organic molecular crystals have emerged as promising alternatives by offering high purity, low defect density, and unique optical anisotropy. Among them, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals (ROMCs) remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their blue and green counterparts. Moreover, the inherent brittleness of most crystals poses significant challenges for their integration into flexible and wearable devices. This review highlights recent advances in the design and development of ROMCs, emphasizing molecular and crystal engineering strategies to overcome photophysical limitations and impart mechanical flexibility. Emerging applications in organic lasers, optical waveguides, and bioimaging are discussed, alongside key challenges and future research directions. By bridging fundamental understanding and practical deployment, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap for the rational design of flexible, red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting crystalline materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic platforms.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Protein Degradation: An Emerging Therapeutics Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a powerful therapeutic approach, with numerous candidates molecules now advancing into clinical development. Recent innovations have incorporated nanoparticles to facilitate and enhance these degradation processes, yielding synergistic effects. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated targeted degradation, outlining recent advances, key challenges, and future opportunities to guide progress in this rapidly evolving field.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy for eliminating disease&#8208;associated proteins, with relevance across disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Since its inception nearly two decades ago, TPD has attracted strong academic and commercial interest, with multiple candidates advancing into clinical trials. Despite this progress, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited solubility, poor cellular uptake, and unpredictable structure&#8211;activity relationship of small&#8208;molecule degraders, which complicate rational design. To address these limitations, alternative platforms such as nanoparticle&#8208;mediated protein degraders (NanoPDs) have gained attention. First reported 17 years ago, NanoPDs harness a diverse array of materials, degradation mechanisms, and linker chemistries to achieve protein clearance through novel pathways. Although promising, their clinical translation remains constrained by barriers such as lysosomal entrapment, protein corona formation, and biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated TPD. We emphasize the design principles underlying nano&#8211;bio interfaces and explore the role of proximity&#8208;induced biology as a mechanism for orchestrating protein interactions. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and key questions that must be addressed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of NanoPDs.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Cation Effects in Electrolytes for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cations play a pivotal role in controlling electrocatalytic reaction pathways, selectivity, and kinetics. A deeper mechanistic understanding of cation effects offers opportunities to overcome the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalytic reactions, enabling the rational design of more efficient electrolyte systems.








Abstract
Traditional understanding of electrocatalytic reactions has primarily focused on the covalent interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces, often overlooking the significant influence of the electrolyte on the catalytic process. Recently, researchers have highlighted the pivotal role of cations in the electrolyte, demonstrating their capability to modulate the reaction pathways and thus the activity and selectivity. These findings underscore the need for a deeper, atomic&#8208;level understanding of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This perspective presents the mechanisms through which cations affect electrocatalysis, with a focus on the hydrogen&#8208;bond network, the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, the electric field within the electrochemical double layer, and the local electronic properties of catalysts. It provides a summary of the influences of cations on various electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, future research directions are provided to maximize the potential of leveraging the cation effects in the design of more efficient electrolyte systems.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Review on Aerogels and Polymeric Aerogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review goes to data&#8208;driven. An exhaustive literature survey provides an overview of research status on aerogels, a category of highly porous solids with unique physicochemical properties. Statistical/data&#8208;driven analysis tells us positive/negative aspects; aerogels have a promising potential to contribute to emerging energy/environmental issues, while they are causing an academic fever with irresponsible exaggerations and a flood of unreliable data.








Abstract
A thoroughly data&#8208;driven review on the chemistry, properties, and applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze&#8208;dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8211;inorganic composites. Process&#8208;property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by a machine&#8208;learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data&#8208;evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.

         <title>Dopant and Exfoliation Induced Simultaneous Modification of Charge Density and C&#9472;C Coupling Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into higher carbon products demands precise catalyst engineering. In this study, we implemented a dual doping strategy in AgBiP&#8322;S&#8326; to optimize charge density and enhance active sites for C&#9472;C coupling. This approach successfully enabled the synthesis of ethylene through the photoreduction of CO2, showcasing the effectiveness of the modified catalyst design.








Abstract
The photochemical conversion of CO2 into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In&#8208;doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO2 reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C2H4 reached 54.3&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn&#8208;doped AgBiP2S6 catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion technologies.

         <title>Silylchromium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation of Undirected Allenes by Sila&#8208;Metalation and &#946;&#8208;Silyl Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted allenes without a directing group underwent chromium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselective semihydrogenation with an (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand and a chlorosilane additive. The silylchromium complex formed in situ promotes semihydrogenation through a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of the allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination, with the silyl group acting as a noninnocent ligand to give E&#8208;alkene products selectively. 








Abstract
The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in controlling of selectivity without coordination assistance from directing groups, wherein over&#8208;hydrogenated alkanes and E/Z&#8208;mixed stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron&#8208;rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;phosphine&#8208;ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H2 to the less substituted and electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted C&#9552;C bonds of allenes while enabling the suppression of competitive over&#8208;hydrogenation, proving generally to form trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenes in high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. By this CAAC&#8208;phosphine&#8208;Cr&#8208;catalyzed selective semihydrogenation, unsaturated nitro, nitrile, alkenyl, and hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive bromide, chloride, and fluoride were compatible with various substitution environments. The in situ forming silylchromium as active catalyst by reaction of low&#8208;valent chromium complex with chlorosilane was established by studying the catalytic and stoichiometric reactivity of this species in the semihydrogenation. Deuterium labeling experiments, HRMS, XPS, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility analysis of the related intermediates and theoretical studies support a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination processes with silyl as noninnocent ligand, leading to the E&#8208;alkene products.

         <title>Lysine&#8208;Targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully developed the first BD1&#8208;targted covalent inhibitor (TCI), BDS4, by utilizing 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA). Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to the marginal effects of BD2 inhibitor RVX&#8208;208. Our developed tool showed clear advantages of long&#8208;lasting domain&#8208;selective TCI in delineating the district function of BD1 and BD2. 








Abstract
The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8211;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully developed the first BD1-targted covalent inhibitor (TCI), BDS4, by utilizing 2-ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA). Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to the marginal effects of BD2 inhibitor RVX-208. Our developed tool showed clear advantages of long-lasting domain-selective TCI in delineating the district function of BD1 and BD2. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bromodomain extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan-BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1- or BD2-selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine-reactive covalent warheads herein we report a set of activity-based probes (ABPs; &lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;P7&lt;/b&gt;) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with &lt;b&gt;P7,&lt;/b&gt; which utilizes 2-ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA), identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine-reactive, irreversible (&lt;b&gt;BDS1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and reversible (&lt;b&gt;BDS5&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)-binding site of BD1 in BRD4. &lt;b&gt;BDS4&lt;/b&gt; showed 104-fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects.

         <title>Aptamer as a Molecular Tethering Agent Induces PrPC Aggregation and Degradation to Inhibit Melanoma Proliferation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular tethering agent, TTe&#8208;TTe, that binds to the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. TTe&#8208;TTe suppresses malignant melanoma proliferation by triggering PrPC to aggregate on the cell membrane surface, followed by its degradation. This versatile platform technology opens up new avenues for targeted protein degradation in a wide range of therapeutic applications, potentially advancing the field of drug discovery.








Abstract
Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane&#8208;bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell&#8208;SELEX and cell&#8208;internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT&#8208;1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT&#8208;1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT&#8208;1e, we engineered an aptamer&#8208;based molecular tethering agent TTe&#8208;TTe. We found that TTe&#8208;TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe&#8208;TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Nanographenes Through Domino Cyclization Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis enables nanographene fabrication but with limited reactions. Here, bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene undergoes domino cyclization via cycloisomerization, cyclodehydrogenation, and formyl cyclization, yielding dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene. STM, STS, and DFT analyses reveal their structures and properties, advancing carbon nanostructure synthesis.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful method to synthesize nanographenes that are difficult to obtain through the solution chemistry, but the number of available reactions is still highly limited. In this study, we demonstrate an unprecedented on&#8208;surface domino cyclization of bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene, leading to dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene through a sequence of 1) cycloisomerization of diaryldiacetylene moieties, 2) oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, and 3) reductive cyclization of formyl groups. The structures of these nanographenes and other cyclized products were unambiguously elucidated by using scanning tunneling microscopy directly on Au(111). Moreover, their electronic properties were investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Our findings offer new insights into the on&#8208;surface cyclization reactions, providing an effective strategy for synthesizing a wider variety of carbon nanostructures.

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 Is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and Is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimization Against Malaria</title>

         <dc:description>
AZD0156, an ATM kinase inhibitor in clinical development, shows promising multistage antiplasmodial activity by targeting Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase (PfPI4K&#946;). With an improved specificity profile relative to other PfPI4K&#946; inhibitors and moderate efficacy in a P. berghei disease model, AZD0156 is an attractive candidate for medicinal chemistry optimization against malaria.








Abstract
New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical, and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta (PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 &#215; 50 mg kg&#8722;1) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimization approach.

Two donor&#8208;acceptor 3D COFs synthesized via Schiff base reactions were integrated into perovskite solar cells&#8217; SAMs. Their architecture enabled efficient charge separation, stable interfacial anchoring, and optimized energy alignment, enhancing hole transport and perovskite quality and reduced defect density. This achieving PCEs up to 25.20%, demonstrating COFs' potential in advancing PSC efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable 2D or 3D structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.

         <title>Noncovalent Synthesis of Topological Heterostructures Using a Site&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly (SSECA) strategy was developed to fabricate a variety of topological heterostructures (THSs) with unprecedented architectures from two&#8208;component systems of organometallic complexes and block copolymers. The THSs are composed of rigid parts of closely stacked organometallic complexes and flexible segments formed from electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of BCPs and the complexes originally in the SPs. 








Abstract
Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co&#8208;assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber&#8208;like moieties. The co&#8208;assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co&#8208;assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher&#8208;order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical allylic substitution method that directly functionalizes unprotected allylic alcohols, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization and toxic reagents. Utilizing iron's unique redox and oxophilic properties, this approach offers a step&#8208;economic and sustainable pathway to allylic functionalization. This method expands the synthetic toolbox and demonstrates the versatility of outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms in radical&#8208;based reactions, facilitating the efficient synthesis of diverse molecular architectures.








Abstract
Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate preactivation to address high C&#9472;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low&#8208;valent iron to promote selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional E/Z selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method's versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical&#8208;based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one&#8208;step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD&#8208;based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, and the n&#8208;doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. 








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and finally to n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;covalent supramolecular and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strategy, employing bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) and judicious choice of donors, enabled tunable circularly polarized delayed luminescence in the red region with a high quantum yield of &#8764;46% and a significant |glum| value of up to &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2.








Abstract
Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states.

&lt;p&gt;The non-covalent supramolecular and intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) strategy, employing bis-chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) and judicious choice of donors, enabled tunable circularly polarized delayed luminescence in the red region with a high quantum yield of &#8764;46% and a significant |g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| value of up to &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge-transfer (CT) interactions are well-established to improve |g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet-harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through-space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom-substituted bis-chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (&#8764;46%) and a significant |g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Supramolecular Ion Channels to Engineer Zn2+ Ion Transport Mediated Chemical&#8208;to&#8208;Optical Signal Transduction</title>

A molecular communication system has been developed to monitor Zn2+ ion transport&#8208;mediated chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process.








Abstract
Artificial ion channels have significant potential for various applications, including molecular communication, bio&#8208;sensing, and constructing artificial cells. In this report, we demonstrated the development of a molecular communication system that transports ions across the lipid bilayers via the formation of supramolecular ion channels and harnesses chemical reactions to overcome the challenges of executing signal&#8208;processing functions at the molecular level. The potent ionophore self&#8208;assembles into nanochannels within the lipid bilayers and selectively transports Zn2+ ions. The movement of Zn2+ ions through these supramolecular ion channels enables the in situ generation of a water&#8208;soluble catalytic system with tyrosine. This catalytic system promotes esterase&#8208;like activity, generating fluorescent reporters from non&#8208;fluorescent ester&#8208;based compounds within the intravesicular environment. Furthermore, this process indicates the formation of a three&#8208;input AND logic gate in the fluorescence mode, allowing the monitoring of the chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process akin to biological counterparts. Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.

         <title>Boosting Initial Coulombic Efficiency in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;based Cathodes by Tuning Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the potential of Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, highlighting the critical challenges posed by low initial coulombic efficiency and irreversible oxygen release. We introduce a novel treatment method using Glyoxal, which facilitates the integration of transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbital hybridization, aimed at optimizing the electrochemical performance of LRMO. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in ICE, increasing from 85.3% to 102.5%. Additionally, the treated LRMO achieves a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, surpassing untreated samples, and exhibits excellent cycling stability with retention rates of 90.1% after 150 cycles and 76.5% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. 








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen (O) 2p orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn t2g&#8208;O 2p hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co2+/Co3+ redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3% to 102.5%, and a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.

         <title>Boosting Urea Electrosynthesis via Asymmetric Oxygen Vacancies in Zn&#8208;Doped Fe2O3 Catalysts</title>

The Zn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 catalysts with Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites can promote the conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO and the coupling of *NO + *CO and thus improve the urea electrosynthesis. It exhibits an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% with a production rate of 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) provides an attractive pathway for storing renewable electricity and substituting traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. However, the kinetics mismatching between CO2 reduction and NO3&#8722; reduction, as well as the difficulty of C&#9472;N coupling, are major challenges in urea electrosynthesis. Herein, we first calculated the free energy of *CO, *OCNO, and *NOH formation over defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts with different metal dopants, which showed that Zn dopant was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we developed Zn&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts (Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV) containing asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites. It exhibited an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% and the remarkable recycling stability. The production rate of urea was as high as 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, which is higher than most of the reported works to date. Detailed control experiments and in situ spectroscopy analyses identified *OCNO as a crucial intermediate for C&#9472;N coupling. The Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV catalyst with asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites showed enhanced *CO coverage and promoted *OCNO formation, leading to high efficiency toward urea production.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Generation via Peroxide&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages of peroxide redox chemistry are explored for green hydrogen production. Peroxide redox electrocatalysts enable efficient and selective peroxide production and oxidation, facilitating on&#8208;site hydrogen generation while achieving a nearly 50% reduction in applied potential compared to conventional water&#8208;splitting methods. An integrated bipolar&#8208;ion gradient system further reduces energy requirements to nearly one&#8208;third of traditional electrolysis.

Hydrogen (H2) production through water electrolysis is a promising route for sustainable energy storage. However, conventional water electrolysis faces several challenges, such as large thermodynamic potential gaps and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics, which lead to high electricity consumption and limitations in H2 storage and transportation. A promising approach to overcoming these hurdles is hybrid water electrolysis, which integrates alternative, thermodynamically favorable reactions at the anode to enhance efficiency. In this study, we explore how peroxide redox electrocatalysis can address critical barriers in sustainable H2 production, storage, and transport. By leveraging a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient peroxide redox electrocatalyst, we demonstrate various electrolysis configurations that significantly reduce the required cell voltage&#8212;from the standard 1.23&#160;V down to &#8722;0.06&#160;V, highlighting its potential for scalable and economically viable electrolysis methodologies for H2 production.

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of peroxide redox chemistry are explored for green hydrogen production. Peroxide redox electrocatalysts enable efficient and selective peroxide production and oxidation, facilitating on-site hydrogen generation while achieving a nearly 50% reduction in applied potential compared to conventional water-splitting methods. An integrated bipolar-ion gradient system further reduces energy requirements to nearly one-third of traditional electrolysis.

         <title>Induced Chirality and Vibrational Optical Activity in an Ionic&#8208;Liquid Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality can be induced in an ionic liquid anion. Normally, the enantiomeric conformers are equally populated, and no optical activity is observed. However, if a chiral probe molecule (e.g., propylene oxide) is added, a non&#8208;symmetric redistribution of the conformers occurs, chirally imprinting the ionic liquid.








Abstract
Here, we show that the four conformers of the regularly used ionic liquid anion bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [NTf2]&#8722;$[{\rm NTf}_2]^{-}$ are true enantiomeric pairs by analyzing their calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra. The significant modes involve those atoms of the anion that form specific hydrogen bond patterns with the chiral probe molecule propylene oxide. Adding this probe molecule to the ionic liquid 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the experimental and simulated spectra indicate intermolecular interaction between the chiral molecule and the liquid and thus the induction of chirality in the anion. This emergence of chirality in the ionic liquid takes place via the hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and the solute, which results in a redistribution of the symmetric occurrence of conformers to an asymmetric one. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanism of chiral induction from the propylene oxide molecule to the ionic liquid anion, while pointing out the importance of rational over a random choice of the ionic liquid building units.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange Reactions as Self&#8208;Blowing Agents for the Production of Reprocessable Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative approach to designing self&#8208;blown foams by leveraging the irreversible and self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification of alkylester which release alcohol gas as blowing agents. The morphology and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of these foams can be precisely tailored by modifying the precursor structure. Remarkably, they can be reprocessed as rigid resins through reversible self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Thermosetting foams are crucial in the polymer industry due to their unique lightweight and durable properties. Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycles toward circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single&#8208;component self&#8208;blowing vitrimer foam. The self&#8208;blowing mechanism originates from the in situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine&#8208;tuned to develop various foams that have an open&#8208;cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%&#8211;853%, porosity of 67%&#8211;86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3&#8211;38&#160;MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine&#8208;co&#8208;ester) network composed of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and &#946;&#8208;aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam&#8208;to&#8208;resin reprocessing.

         <title>Dihydrophenazine Derived Pd6L12 Cage: Self&#8208;Assembly, Polyradical Cations, and Lithium Battery Cathode Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesized a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12 coordination cage (Cage 1) with excellent redox activity. It can reversibly transform into its radical cation form (112&#8226;+) via electrochemical or chemical oxidation/reduction. Both forms' structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In situ spectroelectrochemical techniques verified their redox reversibility and electrochromic behavior. Cage 1 was also used as a lithium battery cathode, with its redox behavior studied by in situ 2D EPR.








Abstract
In this study, we present the self&#8208;assembly of a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12&#8208;type coordination cage 1 showing excellent redox activity and demonstrate the use as the cathode for lithium batteries. The structure of cage 1 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The excellent reversible redox performance of 1 and its electrochromic properties induced by radical species were systematically characterized using in situ UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Notably, a highly stable radical cationic species 112&#8226;+, containing 12 radical cations, was successfully obtained through the chemical oxidation of 1, and its single&#8208;crystal structure was resolved. The excellent redox properties of 1 enable its application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. The 1|Li cell exhibited good cycling stability, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, and an initial discharge capacity of 84 mAh g&#8315;&#185; within a voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.0&#160;V. Furthermore, in situ 2D EPR experiments on lithium batteries visually revealed the excellent cycling stability of the 1&#8208;based cathode material and its reversible two&#8208;step electron transfer process. This study provides important insights into the design, synthesis, and properties of functionalized redox&#8208;active coordination cages, offering a reference for their application in energy storage and functional materials research.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosome SMLM Imaging as Indicators for Functional Diagnostics with a Low&#8208;Phototoxic Spontaneously Blinking Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR spontaneously blinking fluorophore, Aze&#8208;HMSiR, optimized for long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomes is developed. It exhibits superior photostability, pH responsiveness, and minimal phototoxicity. Aze&#8208;HMSiR can reveal key lysosomal characteristics, including distribution, size, and lumen pH, in response to various anticancer agents. Such whole&#8208;cell lysosome SMLM imaging serves as a valuable indicator for lysosomal functional diagnostics.








Abstract
Lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics are key indicators of lysosomal function, making long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging a promising tool for functional diagnostics. However, phototoxicity often compromises imaging reliability. Here, we develop Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a spontaneously blinking silicon rhodamine probe with near&#8208;infrared excitation, enabling low&#8208;phototoxicity, long&#8208;term (50 min) SMLM imaging of lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics. This probe provides super&#8208;resolution insights into lysosomal distribution, size, and lumen pH, essential for understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Using Aze&#8208;HMSiR, we investigate lysosomal function under acidosis, starvation, and anticancer drug treatments. Among seven tested drugs, periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while paclitaxel increased pH and altered lysosomal distribution. These findings highlight Aze&#8208;HMSiR as a powerful tool for lysosomal functional diagnostics and drug screening, offering a robust platform for studying lysosomal dynamics in response to physiological and pharmacological perturbations, particularly in cancer therapy.

This probe provides super-resolution insights into lysosomal distribution, size, and lumen pH, essential for understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Using &lt;b&gt;Aze-HMSiR&lt;/b&gt;, we investigate lysosomal function under acidosis, starvation, and anticancer drug treatments. Among seven tested drugs, periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while paclitaxel increased pH and altered lysosomal distribution. These findings highlight &lt;b&gt;Aze-HMSiR&lt;/b&gt; as a powerful tool for lysosomal functional diagnostics and drug screening, offering a robust platform for studying lysosomal dynamics in response to physiological and pharmacological perturbations, particularly in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulation of Hydrogen Transfer Behaviors by RhCu Alloying Enables an All&#8208;in&#8208;one Sustainable &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system by coupling the rational conversions from nitrogen&#8208;oxysalts and biomass&#8208;derived&#8208;aldehydes (industrial/agricultural wastes). The poor reaction kinetics are efficaciously optimized by RhCu alloy electrocatalyst with dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation properties. So, nitrate and furfural can be simultaneously converted into multiple non&#8208;mixed valuable products (NH3, H2, etc.) with electricity output.








Abstract
Nitrate&#160;and furfural are typical wastes mainly from industrialization and agriculturalization progresses, and their clean conversions are still very challenging for a sustainable future. Nevertheless, scant attention has been devoted to the core&#160;issues: the rational integration of two wastes recycling and the targeted manipulation of hydrogen (H*) transfer behaviors to address their sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system that is thermodynamically designed by coupling nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and furfural oxidation reactions (FORs) together. Particularly, the poor kinetics for both electrode reactions are efficaciously optimized by the bifunctional electrocatalyst of RhCu alloy nanowires on copper foam (RhCu NW/CF) with highly improved dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation performances, thus initializing NO3RR for NH3 synthesis at +0.31&#160;V and driving FOR for H2 harvest at an onset potential lower than 0&#160;V. Eventually, such integrated &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; system can simultaneously effectuate the electricity energy supply (10.76&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), wastewater purification, cathodic hydrogen storage (NH3), anodic H2 production, and biomass upgrading. Hence, it provides a promising perspective of &#8220;turning waste into treasure&#8221; in a rational manner, justifying its all&#8208;in&#8208;one property in addressing the global challenge of sustainable energy.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals how entropy regulates sulfur utilization and cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries. High&#8208;entropy (HES) catalysts enable optimized Zn&#8211;S redox pathways and structural integrity, achieving high sulfur utilization and stable cycling. In contrast, low&#8208; (LES) and medium&#8208;entropy (MES) catalysts show inefficient reactions with by&#8208;product formation and Mn/Co leaching, degrading performance. Practical validation demonstrates HES&#8208;based pouch cells maintain exceptional stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with merely 0.06% capacity decay per cycle, establishing entropy engineering as a practical design strategy. 








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8211;solid Zn&#8211;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional low&#8208;entropy catalysts suffer from poor stability, leading to leaching effects and water splitting during cycling. To overcome these limitations, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8211;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. In contrast, utilizing medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Consequently, the pouch cell with the HES catalysts delivers a high cathode energy density of 313&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Spin State Modulation in Spinel Oxides for Enhanced Nonradical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a strategy that leverages site&#8208;specific spin state modulation in spinel oxides, which optimizes site&#8208;specific functionalities and enhances the overall nonradical oxidation reaction kinetics by 22&#8208;fold. XAS, magnetism characterization combined with theoretical calculation unveil the establishment of a QSEI that facilitates spin channel for charge transfer and the RDS desorption with a lower&#8208;ICOHP in fine&#8208;tuned spin states.








Abstract
Spinel oxides hold tremendous potential for driving advanced oxidation processes, yet the underlying mechanism for maximizing their activity remains unclear. In this study, we leverage tetrahedral and octahedral site interactions in MnxCo3&#8208;xO4 to modulate the spin states, specifically spin alignment and spin moment, thereby enhancing periodate (PI) activation and catalytic performance in contaminant degradation. Through combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, we elucidate the role of spin alignment at synergetic tetrahedral and octahedral sites in facilitating quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) with an efficient electronic spin channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, the engineered high spin configuration in CoMn2O4 raises the d&#8208;band center, favoring stable PI* surface complex formation and accelerating the rate&#8208;determining desorption of IO3&#8722; with a lower&#8208;ICOHP value during the catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the fine&#8208;tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to MnCo2O4 and up to 22&#8208;fold increase compared to the octahedrally&#8208;active only catalysts. Such a site&#8208;specific modulation has been found applicable to other spinel oxides, enlightening fine&#8208;tuned electronic structure for maximizing catalytic performance.

         <title>Hierarchically Self&#8208;Assembled Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Gels for Guest Segregation and Electrical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates were developed that can be utilized as filling material in columns and showed the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. The host&#8208;guest properties could also be monitored in real time by electrical characterization. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation.








Abstract
The search for macroscopic materials with differentially addressable spaces based on molecular containers has long been driven by their great potential for diverse practical applications pertaining guest selective capture and release. Herein, we report a class of gels (G1&#8208;NH2, G1&#8208;UPy, G2&#8208;NH2, and G2&#8208;UPy) that are formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of anion&#8208;coordinated architectures. The well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of the cavities within anion&#8208;coordinated architectures endow the gels with different internal phases, which is beneficial to differentiate the release profiles of guest molecules (dimethylethanolamine, choline, and propyl trimethylammonium) depending on their binding affinity. This study also introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization. This work may thus provide a useful strategy for selective solid&#8208;phase molecular separation.

&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;G&lt;sup&gt;1-UPy&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;G&lt;sup&gt;2-NH2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;G&lt;sup&gt;2-UPy&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) that are formed through hierarchical self-assembly of anion-coordinated architectures. The well-defined shapes and sizes of the cavities within anion-coordinated architectures endow the gels with different internal phases, which is beneficial to differentiate the release profiles of guest molecules (dimethylethanolamine, choline, and propyl trimethylammonium) depending on their binding affinity. This study also introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host-containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization. This work may thus provide a useful strategy for selective solid-phase molecular separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenacetin[3]Arenes: Mannich&#8208;Type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;step acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation of phenacetin and its analogues with paraformaldehyde provides a facile route to hourglass&#8208;shaped phenacetin[3]arenes with distinct functionalized rims in good yields. These novel macrocyclic arene show excellent binding properties and offer the potential for chirality sensing.








Abstract
This work introduces a novel NAm&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot condensation of &#8208; Phenacetin and its homologs with formaldehyde, yielding phenacetin[3]arenes (Ph[3]s) in yields up to 25.9%. Ph[3] exhibits an unsymmetrical hourglass&#8208;shaped architecture, featuring an upper rim adorned with amide groups and a lower rim comprising an alkoxylbenzene cavity. This unique structure facilitates reversible equilibrium between conformers via benzene ring flipping, which simultaneously reverses the orientation of amide groups, establishing equilibrium between C3 and F conformers. Increasing concentrations of organic ammonium guests lead to a transition from a predominantly 1:1 to 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexation. The estimated binding constants for the 1:1 complexes are in the order of 104&#8211;105&#160;M&#8722;1, the overall binding constants for the 1:2 complexes are greater than 106&#160;M&#8722;2. This stepwise complexation triggers a conformational shift from the C3 to F conformer, demonstrating intriguing allosteric behavior. Furthermore, interactions with chiral guests selectively influence the equilibrium of planar chiral conformers, generating chiroptical responses suitable for chirality sensing applications. The distinct functional groups on the two rims facilitate diverse chemical modifications, including reduction, deprotection, and condensation, providing synthetic flexibility for post&#8208;chemical modifications.

By tuning the rigidity and length of DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNAs, we demonstrate a universal strategy for designing 1D porous crystals with tailored geometries and topologies, enabling advanced catalytic applications.








Abstract
The physicochemical properties of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) porous nanomaterials are fundamentally influenced by their channel geometrical and topological characteristics. However, synthesis of geometrically and topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous&#8208;to&#8208;macroporous range remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a universal strategy for constructing 1D open&#8208;channel superlattices through edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly (edge&#8208;bonding) of DNA&#8208;sparsely modified meta&#8208;DNA (M&#8208;DNA). By programming the rigidity and length of sparsely distributed DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNA surfaces, we achieved long&#8208;range ordered assembly of triangular M&#8208;DNA 1D single&#8208;channel superlattice (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;&#181;m) with a macroporous structure. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by assembling hexagonal M&#8208;DNA into 1D multi&#8208;channel superlattice (3.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.0&#160;&#181;m) with a mesoporous structure, thereby reducing the pore size from 140 to 29&#160;nm and the porosity from &#8764;94.2 to &#8764;87.5%. Furthermore, an ultrathin gold layer grown on the triangular M&#8208;DNA superlattice exhibited a &#8764;3.3&#8208;fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity compared to non&#8208;assembled triangular M&#8208;DNA, attributed to the increased surface area and narrower bandgap. This work broadens the design framework for porous crystals assembled via DNA nanotechnology and highlights their potential applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and beyond.

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based study, combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods, sheds light on the complex recognition mechanism between the intrinsically disordered protein Tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn kinase, highlighting how the multiple binding sites present in Tau make the protein an adaptable recognition surface that can function even when single consensus motifs are eliminated.








Abstract
The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline&#8208;rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.

We develop a unique strategy of information encryption/decryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence of 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering. The facile triple&#8208;key implementation working in multiple switching modes (featuring high contrast and quick response) allows us to achieve high security and readout efficiency, opening a new door to information security based on optical encryption.








Abstract
Optical encryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (SRL) materials has received enormous interest in the field of information security. Metal&#8211;halide perovskites, as a newly emerging SRL material, have shown great potential for confidential information encryption/decryption (InfoED) applications. However, it is rather challenging to ensure high security and achieve high readout efficiency in perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED. Herein, we present a unique InfoED strategy using 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering, benefiting from the high contrast and quick response of their photoluminescence behaviors. Indistinguishably encrypted information can be efficiently decrypted through triple&#8208;key implementation (i.e., ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation, temperature control, and narrow&#8208;bandpass filtering) that operates in multiple switching modes, enabling us to demonstrate extremely high security by adopting dot&#8208;matrix patterning scenarios that are virtually uncrackable. As a proof of principle, a simple 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 patterning can yield a code dictionary with random variants as high as &#8764;1047, which will take as long as &#8764;1022 years to crack using the hitherto fastest supercomputer, El Capitan. Our perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED strategy provides a promising solution for information security based on optical encryption.

Our perovskite SRL-based InfoED strategy provides a promising solution for information security based on optical encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Production of H2O2 via Energy Transfer Photocatalysis by Coupling with Furfuryl Alcohol Conversion over an Amide&#8208;Functionalized Heptazine Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;based photocatalysis can be switched to a novel energy transfer route for efficient and selective 1O2 generation through amide functionalization to modulate the electronic structure of the photocatalyst, thus providing a promising approach for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction provides a sustainable approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the charge carrier&#8208;based pathway is severely limited by inefficient charge separation and redox decomposition of the produced H2O2. Energy transfer photocatalysis (EnTP) is an alternative charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;free route for H2O2 synthesis. Herein, we propose a strategy of killing two birds with one stone to simultaneously realize the synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative by coupling EnTP with the Achmatowicz reaction. Results show efficient production of H2O2 at a rate of 14.6&#8201;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1&#160;and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 44.1% at 420&#8201;nm, coupled with the conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol (FFA) into hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;3(6H)&#8208;one with a high selectivity of 85.9%. Such a performance was attributed to the efficient EnTP over the amide&#8208;functionalized heptazine framework photocatalyst for singlet oxygen generation, which induces the FFA conversion and concurrently produces H2O2. A systematic study of the photoexcitation process of the catalysts reveals that the amide functionalization significantly improves the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency, as the structural modification optimizes the electronic structure and thus tunes the composition and distribution of energy bands.

         <title>Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet as a Key Motif of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Inhibitor Designed via Topological Peptide Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregation requires a peptide&#8208;based approach that accounts for the structural heterogeneity of A&#946;. Here, we employ topological reprogramming via disulfide bonds to stabilize antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets within the dimeric peptide. This strategy overcomes limitations of linear peptides by creating structured complexes that resist aggregation, offering a novel tactic for tackling AD&#8208;related protein aggregation.








Abstract
Peptide inhibitor design targeting self&#8208;assembly of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) represents a promising strategy for suppressing the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional approaches have primarily mimicked repetitive sequences found in fibrillar structures of A&#946; aggregates. However, since the inherent flexibility of A&#946; structures promotes the structural changes in the early&#8208;stage oligomerization, a structural modulation should be considered in the design of peptide inhibitors. Herein, we introduce topological reprogramming of peptides to control the structural transformation in pathogenic A&#946; 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42). The eleven&#8208;residue peptide scaffold Pa11 (14HQKLVNFAEDV24) identified through the initial screening was dimerized via a disulfide bond. The dimerization stabilizes A&#946;42 into higher order structures by promoting antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations, thereby significantly suppressing A&#946;42 aggregation. Our approach underscores that modification in peptide connectivity would be a breakthrough for controlling the intrinsic flexibility of A&#946;, surpassing the limitation in conventional, one&#8208;dimensional peptide building block.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Ionic Liquids by Combined Pulse EPR and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids have been proposed as alternatives to molecular solvents. Here, spin probes and spin&#8208;labelled ILs are studied by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, revealing the IL interaction sphere. The results challenge previous interpretations of nitroxide&#8208;solvent nanostructuring in ILs.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a unique class of compounds that have attracted interest for numerous and diverse applications, ranging from solvents for sustainable synthesis to sustainable electrolytes. Understanding their nanostructure and solute&#8208;solvent interactions is a prerequisite to harnessing the full potential of ILs. It has been proposed that ILs solvate non&#8208;polar solutes via their alkyl chains through the formation of nanoscale structures, such as micelles. Here, we determine the non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for such nanostructuring in ILs. We use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with ILs tailored to probe specific interactions through spin and isotopic labelling. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular cation&#8211;anion interactions are probed by electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and 19F PRE experiments and show that nitroxide solutes associate with the polar domains of the imidazolium cation through weak hydrogen bonding with the imidazolium ring protons, as supported by MD simulations. Thus, this study reveals a less structured nanostructure than a micellar picture might suggest, but with clear IL cation&#8208;solute interactions. Our methodology to reveal nanostructure not only has implications for ILs but is also applicable to other soft matter systems.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclohexane Ring Formation in Forazoline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FrazP2, a cytochrome P450, catalyzes cyclohexane ring formation in forazoline A, a marine&#8208;derived antifungal from Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499. Structural and mechanistic studies have uncovered a radical&#8208;mediated cyclization, unlocking opportunities to engineer P450s for the generation of novel antifungal forazoline analogues.








Abstract
Forazoline A, produced by the marine actinomycete Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499, is a unique PK/NRP hybrid macrolactone with promising antifungal in vivo efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism. Although a PKS/NRPS gene cluster was identified as a candidate for forazoline production, the precise biosynthetic pathway and the functions of the tailoring enzymes remain unclear. In this work, the functions of three cytochrome P450 mono&#8208;oxygenases (FrazP1P2P3) were characterized. Notably, FrazP2 was found to mediate cyclohexane ring formation from an 1,3,6&#8208;triene precursor during forazoline A biosynthesis, as confirmed by genetic and biochemical analysis. To gain structural and mechanistic insight into the activity of FrazP2, the crystal structure of a FrazP2&#8208;substrate complex has been solved at 2.3&#160;&#197; resolution. The molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction by FrazP2. These findings expand our understanding of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome P450s, contributing to the diversification of natural products and enabling the creation of unnatural derivatives with increased antifungal potency.

         <title>Rhodium/Indium Heterobimetallic Alloy as an Effective Catalyst for Reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O Silylation of Ethers with Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging.








Abstract
C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic small molecules as well as polymers. The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes.

Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging. This research advances the development of heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts as an option to enable organic transformations that have not yet been achieved using homogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Nucleophilic Covalent Ligands Enable Simultaneous Surface Reconstruction and Passivation of Colloidal InSb Quantum Dots for Stable Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simultaneous surface reconstruction and passivation strategy is designed for indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. This leads to stable CQD inks and 1450&#160;nm&#8208;operating InSb CQD photodetectors with 28% external quantum efficiency and 300&#160;h operating lifetime.








Abstract
Indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors due to their large Bohr exciton radius and tunable bandgap in the 0.6&#8211;1.3&#160;eV range. However, the formation of metal oxides on InSb surfaces during synthesis impedes charge transport, necessitating CQD resurfacing strategies for integration into photodetectors. Previous reports achieved progress in device efficiency by resurfacing these CQDs with acid&#8208;halide sequential treatments, but the device operating stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a solution&#8208;phase strategy for surface reconstruction and passivation of InSb CQDs using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. We find that short&#8208;chain thiol molecules remove surface metal oxides through nucleophilic attack and enable robust passivation of In and Sb via strong covalent bonds, whereas metal sulfides are less effective at oxide removal and passivation. Consequently, the thiolate&#8208;passivated CQDs exhibit a tenfold decrease in trap state density compared to controls and remain structurally and optically stable for 5 months. We demonstrate InSb CQD SWIR photodetectors that realize a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28% at 1450&#160;nm, with the highest operating stability among reported CQD SWIR photodetectors, retaining 95% of performance following 300&#160;h of biased and illuminated operation.

         <title>Development of an Organoautocatalyzed Double &#963;&#8208;Bond C(sp2)&#8208;N Transamination Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of cyclic tertiary amines is disclosed as a high&#8208;yielding, scalable reaction that proceeds under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions. It operates via a multi&#8208;step domino reaction mechanism, where an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt functions as a HBD organoautocatalyst. The reaction opens the door for the efficient synthesis of novel N&#8208;substituted DNDHPs of interest in both life and materials sciences.








Abstract
The transamination reaction, which involves the conversion of one amine to another, traditionally relies on biological enzyme catalysts. Although chemists have recently developed a few transition metal&#8208;catalyzed methods, mimicking these enzymes to interconvert amine groups in acyclic substrates via transamination metathesis of a single C(sp2)&#9472;N bond, transamination of cyclic tertiary amines has remained a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we present the development of organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of two C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds in a cyclic substrate that allows for the challenging transformation to take place with up to 95% yield under exceptionally mild reaction conditions at room temperature without external catalysts and/or additives. The reaction mechanism has been studied in detail through time&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;NMR, 2D NMR, and computational methods. Remarkably, in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt acts as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) organoautocatalyst in this multi&#8208;step domino process. The new organoautocatalyzed methodology gives environmentally friendly, atom&#8208;economical, straightforward, and rapid access to N&#8208;substituted 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DNDHPs), thus offering facile entry to privileged bioactive compounds.

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted esters with aryl bromides is established for the first time by employing P&#8208;chiral monophosphorus ligand 3&#8208;Pent&#8208;BIDIME as a chiral ligand, leading to a series of enantioenriched &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl esters possessing quaternary carbon stereocenters in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivities. The method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, excellent functional group compatibility, and low Pd loadings (as low as 1&#160;mol%). Its synthetic utilities are exemplified by the efficient preparation of a chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl substituted &#947;&#8208;lactone and the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;amolanone.

Abstract
This work presents the first general synthetic access to N&#8208;CH&#8322;F and N&#8208;CHRF carbamates, thiocarbamates, formamides, alkynamides, and related compounds. The synthetic approach employs N&#8208;CH2F and N&#8208;CHRF carbamoyl fluorides as versatile strategic building blocks, which can be efficiently synthesized in a single step directly from readily available amines or imines.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Activation of C&#9472;H Bond in Toluene by Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Supported Subnanometric PtOx Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in hydrocarbon molecules to produce valuable oxygenates still suffers from the limited generation of reactive species and the weak adsorption of reactants. This study achieved the selective oxidation of toluene using a TiO2 supported subnanometric PtOx cluster (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode via an electrophilic OH*&#8208;mediated pathway. The modification of PtOx cluster can facilitate toluene adsorption and OH* generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a subnanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of &#8764;170&#160;&#181;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that subnanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue toward the activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.

         <title>Modulation of Photoluminescence of BODIHY Dye Using Water&#8208;Soluble Coordination Cages With Different Shapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of Boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) (G1) dye was effectively controlled through confinement within coordination cages of different shapes. The encapsulation of G1 within a double&#8208;square cage (MC1) resulted in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement within an octahedral cage (MC2) exhibited a weak emission. Moreover, we achieved turn&#8208;on emission of G1 through the displacement of G1 from MC2 to MC1.








Abstract
The confinement of guest molecules within supramolecular hosts can alter their photophysical properties. However, the shapes of the hosts in regulating the guest's emission remains underexplored. Herein, we investigate how the shape of the host alters the emission behavior of boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) (G1) dye encapsulated within two iso&#8208;stoichiometric water&#8208;soluble coordination cages: MC1 (double&#8208;square cage) and MC2 (octahedral cage). Encapsulation of G1 within MC1 results in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement in MC2 leads to a non&#8208;emissive host&#8211;guest solution. A similar trend was observed with different sets of iso&#8208;stoichiometric cages MC3 (double&#8208;square cage) and MC4 (octahedral cage). Using a combination of femtosecond transient absorption and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we observed that the disparity in fluorescence behavior of BODIHY is attributed to charge transfer interactions between the guest and ligand panels of cages. The shape of the coordination cage dictates the preorganization of the guest within the cavity, thereby suppressing or promoting this charge transfer interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate a turn&#8208;on emission of BODIHY dye due to its preferential binding to a double&#8208;square cage. These findings provide fundamental insights into host&#8208;mediated modulation of the guest's photophysics and offer a blueprint for designing supramolecular systems with tunable emissive behavior.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets for the Assembly of Efficient Membrane Bioreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly method to trap enzymes between covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets instead for the construction of membrane bioreactors. This design boosts mass transfer, shields enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products, and enables rapid substrate conversion (complete in 7.95 s)&#8212;achieving 1018&#215; higher activity than free enzymes. The reactor maintains stability under continuous use and works with diverse enzymes/COFs, offering a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.








Abstract
Immobilizing fragile enzymes in porous materials holds significant potential for biocatalysis but encounters challenges such as mismatched enzyme size and pore structure of host materials, along with harsh assembly conditions that can denature enzymes. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for constructing membrane bioreactors through water&#8208;mediated, vacuum&#8208;assisted layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets with enzymes. This method effectively addresses pore size limitations, preserves enzyme activity, and promotes convective transport of reactants to active sites, while shielding enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products through rapid transport in continuous membrane catalysis. The optimized bioreactor achieves a 1018&#8208;fold increase in relative activity compared to free enzymes in batch reactions, completing substrate conversion in just 7.95 s, and demonstrating enhanced stability.

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;Energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material descriptors are first proposed to guide the design and screening of high&#8208;energy density p&#8208;type organic cathode materials. Triphenylamine and synthesized p&#8208;PZA POP proved the rationality of these descriptors. Na||p&#8208;PZA POP batteries exhibit a surprisingly high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance.

P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50&#160;&#176;C (166.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1) to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (141.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.

         <title>Bromide as Noninnocent Ligand to Iron Tames Fenton Chemistry for Chemoselective Nondegrading Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time that the bromide ion, acting as a non&#8208;N&#8208;ligand in iron complexes with the tridentate N&#8208;ligand bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BMPA), which is traditionally used in Fenton chemistry to degrade organic compounds, tames Fenton chemistry and enables chemo&#8208;selective, nondegrading oxidation reactions. This discovery of the bromide effect bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation, potentially inspiring further investigation into the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands of iron complexes for new reactivity and applications. The overlooked inorganic anion may be exploited in other catalytic systems.








Abstract
It has long been the chemistry dogma that the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand of iron complexes determines the redox reactivity; tetra&#8208; and/or pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;based ligand (N&#8208;ligand: PDP, porphyrin, N4Py) enables chemo&#8208;selective oxidation through high&#8208;valent iron species (FeIV/V&#9552;O), while bi&#8208; and/or tridentate N&#8208;ligand leads to the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., hydroxyl radical) via a Fenton chemistry pathway. The effect of inorganic anionic ligands (i.e., halides, pseudohalides, triflate, nitrate, sulfate, etc) of these iron complexes has rarely been examined and overlooked as an &#8220;innocent&#8221; anion. Herein, we report our discovery that bromide (Br&#8722;) is not an innocent ligand to the iron&#8208;BPMA complexes [BMPA: bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine] but a decisive factor for taming the Fenton chemistry (ROS) into a mild [HOBr] oxidant, which allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective oxidation of furans, indoles, and sulfides without noticeable degradation. In contrast to the conventional Fenton chemistry pathway by many tridentate N&#8208;ligand iron complexes, our [Fe(BMPA)Br3] mimics haloperoxidases to generate HOBr by oxidation of bromide ion with hydrogen peroxide. The discovery of the bromide effect on iron complexes bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and might stimulate interest in reinvestigating the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligand of iron complexes for discovery of new reactivity and new applications. Additionally, the new catalytic system represents a mild and green oxidation method that might be useful in academia and industry.

         <title>Evoking Simultaneous Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by a Dual&#8208;Locked Platinum (IV) Prodrug for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug combines a TLR7/8 agonist (IMDQ) with a GGT&#8208;responsive moiety. Reduction to Pt(II) triggers GGT&#8208;mediated cleavage of axial ligands, releasing IMDQ to activate immunity. TLR7/8 signaling boosts T&#8208;cell infiltration into tumors and stimulates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs). Synergy between platinum chemotherapy and immune activation achieves potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
While platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, their clinical potential is limited by off&#8208;target toxicity and restricted antitumor mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug designed for tumor&#8208;specific activation, combining platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy with TLR7/8&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. The prodrug features a &#947;&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;caged TLR7/8 agonist as an axial ligand, enabling sequential activation by elevated glutathione (GSH) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the tumor microenvironment. Reduction of the Pt(IV) core releases cisplatin and depletes intracellular reductants, amplifying reactive oxygen species to trigger synergistic ferroptosis and apoptosis. Concurrently, GGT&#8208;cleaved axial ligand activates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells, repolarizing immunosuppressive M2&#8208;like macrophages to pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like phenotypes while recruiting effector and memory T cells. In murine models, the Pt(IV) prodrug demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy by confining immune activation to malignant tissues, eradicating primary tumors, and establishing durable protective immunity against recurrence. This spatiotemporally controlled dual&#8208;release strategy minimizes systemic toxicity while synergizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, offering a transformative approach for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) Toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol was developed to scale up ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs with simple formate, enabling one&#8208;step direct separation of C2H4 from the binary C2H2/C2H4 or ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 gas mixtures with high separation efficiency and cost&#8208;saving preparation.








Abstract
The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses toward low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries Enable Selective Urea Production From Simulated Flue Gas in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8315; presents a promising route for sustainable urea production. Here, we show that in situ generated CO2 bubbles within a bi(carbonate) reduction zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer can boost urea selectivity by engendering a high density of triple&#8208;phase boundaries.








Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a promising pathway toward sustainable urea production. However, achieving high urea selectivity is challenging due to substantial competing side reactions. Here, we show that engendering a high density of CO2 bubbles on the catalyst surface creates numerous triple&#8208;phase boundaries that are key toward enhancing CO2 versus NO3&#8722; availability for selective urea production. We implemented this strategy using a bipolar membrane in a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, which allows for the in situ conversion of (bi)carbonate to CO2 bubbles at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Notably, we demonstrate that this electrolyzer system can utilize simulated flue gas (20% CO2&#160;+&#160;5% O2) for urea production. With a Cu95Ru5 catalyst, we achieve a urea Faradaic efficiency of 58% at 2&#160;V full&#8208;cell voltage over an extended 30&#8208;h period and a peak production rate of 35.46&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1. Under these conditions, the Faradaic efficiency to hydrogen evolution and nitrate reduction are 14.7% and 21.6%, respectively. Strikingly, these results with simulated flue gas are comparable to previously reported systems that employ pure CO2. Our results introduce a simple yet effective design approach toward developing efficient electrolyzer systems for urea production.

         <title>Activating Surface Oxygen in Ce/Mo&#8208;Doped Ni Oxyhydroxide for Synergistically Enhancing Furfural Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mo/Ce co&#8208;doped Ni oxyhydroxide was prepared for the electrochemical oxidation of furfural coupled with hydrogen evolution. Mo promotes the adsorption of furfural while Ce promotes the formation of OOH, and the synergistic effect of Ce and Mo leads to an industrial current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at only 1.46&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
The integration of biomass&#8208;platform molecule oxidation with water electrolysis is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production and obtain high&#8208;value chemicals simultaneously, yet the efficiency of organic oxidation requires further improvement. Herein, we developed a highly efficient Ce, Mo co&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, where Mo with high spin state promotes the adsorption of furfural (FA), while Ce activates surface lattice oxygen (OL), lowering the energy barrier for OL&#9472;OH coupling to form OOH, the key intermediate for high current densities. The catalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low potential of 1.46&#160;V versus RHE in furfural oxidation, with exceptional selectivity (99.4%) and Faradaic efficiency (97.7%) for furoic acid. When deployed as anode in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane reactor, the NiMoCe/NF catalyst sustains a current density of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.85 and 2.15&#160;V, respectively, surpassing most reported continuous flow electrolyzers limited to 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the system exhibits outstanding durability after 200&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides critical insights into the rational design of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization coupled with industrial hydrogen production.

A woven two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic polymer network (CityU&#8208;46) was designed, fabricated, and structurally resolved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed a unique, well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over, two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. CityU&#8208;46, serving as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance in practical lithium metal cells.








Abstract
Macroscopic weaving has been proven to be the most enduring and effective method for manufacturing fabrics to meet the practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, the construction of molecular structures with exquisite topologies and specific properties based on molecular weaving is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed and fabricated a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) woven covalent organic polymer (COP) network (named as CityU&#8208;46) driven by the dative N&#8594;B bonds between the 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxa&#8208;borole)benzene (BACT) and 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (BPT). The complex woven topology of CityU&#8208;46 was determined using a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, revealing that it features a well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over and two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. Due to its structural merits, CityU&#8208;46 can be used as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, significantly improving the stability and long&#8208;term performance of lithium metal cells.

         <title>Nucleophilic Germylation of Stable &#960; Bonds via Ge&#9472;Ge Bond Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically controlled nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds was achieved by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology enables unprecedented multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes, affording 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes.








Abstract
Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo&#8208;germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#9472;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo&#8208;germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favored side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo&#8208;convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#9472;Ge) in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo-germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#9472;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo-germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favored side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo-convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#9472;Ge) in the presence of KO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Bu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1-alkyl-1-germylalkanes, 1,1-digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1-trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8211;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of halogenated COF nanoemitters via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The introduction of halogen atoms facilitates p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within COF skeleton, leading to a 49&#8208;fold ECL enhancement compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8211;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8211;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Mechanosensitive Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Visualizing Temporal Changes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanosensitive conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) with integrated twistable bonds enable real&#8208;time imaging of membrane tension in lipid bilayers. Using fluorescence lifetime analysis, COE&#8208;BY probes reveal vesicle rigidity changes during endocytosis, providing insights into membrane mechanics at the subcellular level.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;spanning molecules that serve as fluorescent dyes for bioimaging. However, COE emission has thus far only been capable of visualizing dye location and their preferential accumulation in different membrane&#8208;bound intracellular compartments. Herein, we report the first example of environmentally sensitive COEs for visualizing temporal changes in live cells, providing information on the physical properties of intracellular lipid bilayer membranes. The new COE&#8208;BY series is designed around a BODIPY central unit with a membrane&#8208;spanning topology and six cationic pendant groups ensuring solubility in aqueous media. These reporters feature high two&#8208;photon absorption cross section, NIR&#8208;II excitation capabilities under multiphoton excitation, and high dye brightness; all highly desirable photophysical features for bioimaging. The emission lifetime of the probes was sensitive to changes to both the lipid composition of model vesicle systems and membrane tension within cells, induced by either mechanical or osmotic stress. Using two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it is possible to use the most efficient emitter, namely, COE&#8208;BYPhOC4, to image changes in the mechanical properties of intracellular membranes. We show that these COEs remain stably vesicle&#8208;bound within the endolysosomal pathway over extended periods, allowing for long&#8208;term monitoring of the associated biophysical changes of these vesicles over time.

         <title>Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids with Carboxylic Acids via Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives with carboxylic acids has been developed, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as a pivotal platform for constructing C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, using two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids as a feedstock to form chiral &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones remains a considerable challenge due to side reactions such as decarboxylative reduction and homocoupling. Herein, we report for the first time a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives and aliphatic carboxylic acids, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% e.e.). The advantage of this reaction is that it eliminates the need for metal reductants and the use of precious metal photocatalysts and utilizes renewable feedstocks. The use of a coiled&#8208;tube continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor can shorten the illumination time by half and obtain results comparable to those of a batch reaction. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments support a pathway in which photocatalytic decarboxylation generates &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl radical species, and the Ni(I)&#8211;alkyl intermediate activates the in situ&#8211;formed mixed anhydride followed by reductive elimination to give the product in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind UV Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve solar&#8208;blind UV mechanoluminescent (ML) materials through strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode. DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar&#8208;blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright&#8208;field stress visualization.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.

         <title>Harnessing Negative Photochromism in Styryl Cyanines for Light&#8208;Modulated Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show how photo switchable styryl cyanines undergo an extremely efficient photochemical ring&#8208;closing reaction upon irradiation. Furthermore, substituents on the ring and the nature of their surroundings can be used to tune their chemistry, kinetics, and photochemical properties. Finally, we demonstrate how these molecules can be used as smart dopants to control proton transport using light in a polymeric matrix.








Abstract
Efficient photoswitches capable of complete conversion to their metastable isomer are not so common, yet highly desirable for applications in smart materials and devices. Here, we report the photochromic behavior of a series of styryl cyanine photoswitches, all demonstrating high switching efficiency, with some achieving full conversion to the metastable form. Despite structural similarities to spiropyran photoswitches, we demonstrate that the photochemistry of styryl cyanines is fundamentally different. Unlike classical photoswitches that rely on double&#8208;bond rotation, these molecules undergo substantial geometric changes via the formation of a spiro carbon. This transformation disrupts conjugation, causing a desirable blue shift in absorbance ideal for creating responsive materials and devices. We further show that the switching kinetics can be finely tuned through electronic effects of various substituents or the choice of surrounding medium. These photoswitches exhibit excellent fatigue resistance and can be easily shifted into the visible region via their acidochromic properties. Taking advantage of their high switching efficiency and affinity for acidic polymers, we finally propose their use as smart dopants to develop light&#8208;responsive materials with tunable proton transport properties under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Beyond Second Coordination Shell: Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;Electrons Delocalization Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) depend on hierarchical coordination environments, yet higher&#8208;order shells (&gt;2nd) critically influence electronic structures via long&#8208;range charge delocalization. This study pioneers long&#8208;range interaction engineering in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for CO2 electroreduction. By tailoring pyrolysis of NiTPP to preserve Ni&#8208;N4 coordination shell (first and second) while eliminating peripheral &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the catalyst achieves a 29&#8208;fold CO efficiency boost (85.9% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V) and 98.3% selectivity at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although long&#8208;range charge delocalization beyond the second coordination shell critically influence the geometric and electronic properties of single&#8208;atom active sites, their systematic modulation to enhance multielectron catalytic processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a site&#8208;specific strategy to engineer the nickel tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) precursors by selectively cleaving carbon&#8211;carbon single bonds at the &#946;&#8208;carbon sites. This approach preserves the Ni&#8208;centered first and second coordination shells while systematically removing peripheral &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in extended coordination environments. The resultant Ni&#8208;N4 catalyst exhibits a 29&#8208;fold enhancement in CO faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.4&#160;V versus RHE compared to original counterparts. Notably, it maintains 98.3% CO selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities up to 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron&#8208;enriched Ni sites, arising from precisely regulated charge delocalization in higher coordination shells, facilitate stabilization of the critical *COOH intermediate. Our findings establish a paradigm for advanced catalyst design through deliberate engineering of higher coordination shells.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regioregular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the double asymmetric core and symmetric/asymmetric terminal engineering are applied to develop multiple&#8208;asymmetric acceptors. By delicately tuning the number and position of peripheral F and Cl atoms, the regioregular triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary OSCs yield the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.32% and ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) among selenium&#8208;substituted acceptors. 








Abstract
Asymmetric molecular engineering is utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), whereas adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge, and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regioregular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25%, and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking and excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179&#160;eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.

         <title>Stereocontrol in Conformationally Stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building in our expertize in the synthesis of trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans via organocatalyzed domino Michael/O&#8208;cyclization between &#946;&#8208;naphthols and nitroalkenes, we developed an efficient strategy to access a new family of atropisomers bearing a conformationally stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and two stereogenic centers through simple and highly diastereoselective alkylation of dihydrofurans with structurally diverse electrophiles. This crucial step places the nitro group in a relative cis&#8208;configuration with respect to the aromatic moiety, effectively increasing the barrier to diastereomerization and stabilizing the molecular conformation.








Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step sequence for the enantioselective construction of a rare family of stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) atropisomers featuring two additional stereogenic centers. The process begins with an organocatalyzed dihydrobenzofurannulation that establishes and controls the stereochemistry of two carbon centers, followed by a highly diastereoselective functionalization that significantly enhances the barrier to diastereomerization of the C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond, effectively locking and stabilizing its configuration.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Desolventization and Lithium&#8208;Rich Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with lithiophilic sites and hydrogen bond interaction with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) can accelerate the desolvation process of lithium ion and guide the rapid and uniform deposition of Li+.








Abstract
Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C&#9552;O, C&#9552;N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11&#160;000&#160;h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA Transfection Efficiency in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing an ionizable lipid with a thioamide adjacent to the tertiary amine have a lower pKa than those containing an analogous lipid with a conventional amide, and exhibit significantly improved mRNA transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent pKa of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with pKa values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP pKa remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide&#8208;containing (SAM) LNPs and amide&#8208;containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent pKa of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a pKa in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in pKa in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.

         <title>Regulated Second&#8208;sphere Coordination in Amorphous Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy is employed by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU), with efforts to trigger more orbital interactions with guest molecules. Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is chosen to transform rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. Such architecture with clear and unique second&#8208;sphere interaction can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecule and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation.








Abstract
The endeavor toward photocatalytic CO2 fixation is largely hampered by the rigid spatial configurations and inadequate orbital overlap between the catalytic site and CO2. Herein, we propose a second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU). Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is constructed as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to achieve creative control over the second coordination sphere. Such architecture transforms rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. This shift can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecules and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation. Both in situ experiments and theoretical calculations verify second&#8208;sphere engineering endows the Lewis base sites with high electron donating capacity and promotes the electron injection into the &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of the CO2 molecule effectively. Hence, the a&#8208;MOF displays approximately double the yield in various photocatalytic CO2 reactions compared with its crystalline counterpart. Moreover, its photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2 battery delivers higher discharging voltage and a fourfold increment of discharge capacity at 200&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. The unique ability to tailor the secondary coordination sphere performs attractive merits governing the small molecule binding affinity, aiming to manipulate the local microenvironment of open metal sites for efficient CO2 fixation.

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is engineered, featuring In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites that establish dual&#8208;channel carrier transfer pathways and substantially prolong photogenerated carrier lifetimes five&#8208;fold. These synergistic effects enable direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR for efficient H2O2 production from O2 in pure water, achieving a record apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm among inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts.








Abstract
The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers from sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#9472;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3&#160;wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although computationally predicted, N2 activation with an in situ generated low&#8208;valent &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) SrI precursor did not result in a stable complex. First dinitrogen fixation with Sr was achieved using a heterobimetallic approach. This highly reducing product vigorously reacts with Teflon.








Abstract
DFT calculations on &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#9472;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(&#956;&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#8722; dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(Me)C&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); DIPePNN&#160;=&#160;DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#8722; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.

         <title>Selective CO Electroreduction to Multicarbon Oxygenates Over Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag Sites in Alkaline Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the *OH cleavage of *COCOH toward *COO, thereby enhancing the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CO electroreduction. CO electrolysis over the optimized CuAg catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at a current density of 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2 in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to produce multicarbon (C2+) oxygenates using renewable electricity is a promising carbon utilization pathway. However, the performance of this process suffers from low C2+ oxygenates selectivity and insufficient current density. Here, we employed a Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic strategy to enhance the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CORR in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer at ampere&#8208;level current densities. The Cu&#8211;Ag catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering feature atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface, which are key to promoting the formation of C2+ oxygenates. Increasing Ag content favors C2+ oxygenates formation while inhibiting ethylene production. The optimized Cu2Ag catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the dissociation of *COCOH to *CCO, thus favoring C2+ oxygenates formation.

         <title>Valence Tautomerism and Alkaline Properties of Global Aromatic Imine&#8208; and Methine&#8208;Bridged all&#8208;Benzenoid Macrocyclic Superpyrazine and Supertriazine</title>

         <dc:description>
We prepared two imine macrocycles, SPAZ and STAZ, as analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. SPAZ and STAZ exhibit Br&#248;nsted basicity with pKa values of 0.97 and 3.27, respectively. Notably, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, facilitated by aza[30]annulene pathways.








Abstract
The comprehensive understanding of the ground&#8208;state electronic structures of all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles and their charged species, particularly those exhibiting global (anti)aromaticity, remains poorly resolved. Here, we present two imine&#8208; and methine&#8208;bridged all&#8208;benzenoid [6]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes SPAZ (superpyrazine) and STAZ (supertriazine)&#8208;designed as &#960;&#8208;extended analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. For the first time, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; alternating benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, mediated by a 30&#960; azaannulene conjugated pathway. The aromatic stabilization energy of global aromatic delocalization would partially counterbalance the energy penalty for disrupting three benzenoid sextets. Further protonation studies demonstrate their alkaline characteristics (pKa&#160;=&#160;0.97 for SPAZ; 3.27 for STAZ), with diprotonated SPAZ&#8208;DH and monoprotonated STAZ&#8208;MH adopting planarized geometries that amplify global aromaticity through charge&#8208;induced structural constraints and enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Notably, two&#8208;electron reduction generates a dianion SPAZ&#8208;DA exhibiting 32&#960; electron global antiaromaticity with amine N atom embedded aza[30]annulene pathway. These findings establish a framework for decoding electronic structure property relationships in all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles, offering insights into aromaticity modulated regulations through tautomerism, protonation, and redox switching.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Selective Hydroamination of Enamides for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal enamides were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to achieve unconventional &#946;&#8208;regioselectivity with up to 99% ee. This coordination assistance strategy creates an efficient pathway for synthesizing valuable enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;diamine derivatives.








Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;rich alkenes has been developed. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center effectively overrides the inherent electronic preference of N&#9472;H addition to an enamide, delivering unconventional &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Phthalimide is utilized as a readily removable amination agent. This methodology enables direct access to enantio&#8208;enriched 1,2&#8208;diamines from readily available materials with 100% atom economy, exclusive regioselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee).

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;Ring Intramolecular Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a novel SAM molecular design strategy by introducing fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions. The designed molecule, JJ32, features a benzo[5,6][1,4]thiazino[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline skeleton, where strong D&#8211;A interactions enhance charge delocalization and downshift the LUMO energy level. This leads to enhanced photostability, redox stability, and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, the improved redox stability benefits the promising polyoxometalate/SAM composite HSL, allowing the JJ32/HPWO&#8208;based OSC to reach 19.85% efficiency with improved stability.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these molecules frequently exhibit a shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, rendering them prone to photodegradation.&#160;To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8211;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included in polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs), resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.85% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8211;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;Coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets has been successfully developed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. The isolated Mo sites optimize the driving force of photogenerated holes, which greatly accelerates the electron transfer rate of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;concentration alkyl radicals.








Abstract
Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develmically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400&#160;nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picoseconds. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#9472;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation.

         <title>Strain Energy Induced Rotary Speed Acceleration in a Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy accelerates rotary speed in overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors by tuning cycloparaphenylene loop size, preserving core structures. Strain energy variations drive hierarchical acceleration up to 389&#8208;fold. This study systematically reveals motor behavior under strain, offering new avenues for engineering light&#8208;driven nanomachines.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes represent a major type of molecular machines that are able to rotate unidirectionally. The regulation of the rotary speed without altering the core structure of a motor is crucial and remains a major challenge. In the present study, we reported that the rotary speed of molecular motors can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the strain energy of cycloparaphenylene (CPP). A series of molecular motors incorporated in CPP with varying sizes were synthesized, and their photochemical and thermal isomerization behaviors were meticulously examined using UV&#8211;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The remarkable increase of the acceleration effect of the rotary speed with decreasing macrocycle sizes, up to 389&#8208;fold, can be attributed to the strain energy induced bending in the stator part, which reduces steric hindrance in the &#8220;fjord region&#8221; of the molecule, supported by a detailed computational study employing density functional theory. This work provides systematic insight into the behavior of molecular motors under strain energy, thereby paving the way for the application of motor&#8208;incorporating CPPs as a general strategy to accelerate the rotary speed of molecular motors.

         <title>Tri&#8208;Coordinated Boron Species in Confined Boron Oxide Catalysts for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined BOx@SiO2 with highly dispersed BOx species was synthesized by the in situ transformation of BN@SiO2, which showed a remarkable activity of a unique C3H8 conversion uprush increasing from 5.3% at 410&#160;&#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key for the efficient C3H8 activation was the increased amount of tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH derived from the dispersion of molten BOx species within spatially confined SiO2.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward synthesis of confined boron&#8208;based catalysts commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low&#8208;temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8211;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#9472;O&#9472;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angles of O&#9472;B&#9472;O and B&#9472;O&#9472;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly in molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#9472;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.

&lt;/i&gt; species was synthesized by the in situ transformation of BN@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which showed a remarkable activity of a unique C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; conversion uprush increasing from 5.3% at 410&#160;&#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key for the efficient C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; activation was the increased amount of tri-coordinated B&#9472;OH derived from the dispersion of molten BO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species within spatially confined SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boron-based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward synthesis of confined boron-based catalysts commonly using H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst showing an impressive low-temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8211;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#9472;O&#9472;Si and hydrogen bonds. BO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri-coordinated B&#9472;OH (B[3]&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; and B[3]&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;) active sites from the dispersion of molten BO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species in confined SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angles of O&#9472;B&#9472;O and B&#9472;O&#9472;B and system disorder of BO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species increased significantly in molten state, favoring the dispersion of BO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species and formation of B&#9472;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Xanthopinacol Boronate: A Robust, Photochemically Assembled and Cleavable Boronic Ester for Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xanthopinacol (xpin) boronates are a conceptually new class of masked boronic acids designed to alleviate many of the disadvantages of pinacol esters and other popular adducts. They can be formed directly from xanthone and UV light, undergo orthogonal transformations, and are cleavable under photoredox catalysis or oxidative conditions that recycle xanthone to prevent the re&#8208;esterification and facilitate the isolation of the boronic acid.








Abstract
Organoboronic acids impact numerous fields of application from organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials science. However, their highly polar nature makes them challenging to handle, purify, and characterize. Boronic esters help overcome these issues, and pinacol esters (Bpin) have become the dominant boronic acid surrogate in organic synthesis. Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks. Its formation from pinacol is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by&#8208;product. Although other boronyl protecting groups exist, their removal requires harsh pH conditions. To address these issues, we developed xanthopinacol boronates (Bxpin), a robust protecting group for boronic acids with excellent orthogonality in various chemical reactions and mild irreversible removal under catalyzed photoredox conditions. Xpin boronates can be obtained directly by irradiation of a mixture of free boronic acid and xanthone with UV light, causing an in situ dimerization of xanthone to the required xanthopinacol. The unique attributes of xpin boronates were further studied by UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and various stability tests.

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective composite binder strategy is proposed to establish multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels within the LiFePO4 cathode, which significantly improves the Li+ transport efficiency and achieves high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high cathode active loading.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8722;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the highly efficient Qx series of small molecules, we have synthesized T&#8208;Qxs, which are shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecules with high glass transition temperature. The miscibility with the polymer donor PM6 was fine&#8208;tuned by modulation of the central and terminal atoms, thereby altering the molecular distortion angle. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl achieve both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high thermal stability.








Abstract
The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development into organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188 &#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21&#160;eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93&#160;V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.

         <title>Intrinsically Luminescent Nematic Liquid Crystals Enabling High&#8208;Brightness Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Chiral Coassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of luminescent nematic liquid crystals (N&#8208;LCs) exhibiting full&#8208;color emission was developed. Through coassembly with chiral dopants, these N&#8208;LCs enabled the fabrication of high&#8208;brightness full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) films with simultaneously enhanced glum (up to 0.75) and photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 71%), representing the best performance to date among all intrinsically luminescent CPL materials.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (glum) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs betwwen glum value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films via coassembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. First, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (2PFQ, 2PFBQ, 2PFB, 2PFSe, and 2PFS) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl&#8208;functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, chiral coassembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (P/M&#8208;THH) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection&#8208;free N*&#8208;LC films exhibiting high&#8208;brightness CPL with recorded glum values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full&#8208;color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of glum and PLQY enables high&#8208;brightness CPL with advanced anticounterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.

&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; (up to 0.75) and photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 71%), representing the best performance to date among all intrinsically luminescent CPL materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade-offs betwwen &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*-LC) films via coassembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. First, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (&lt;b&gt;2PFQ&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2PFBQ&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2PFB&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2PFSe&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2PFS&lt;/b&gt;) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl-functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, chiral coassembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;M-&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THH&lt;/b&gt;) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection-free N*-LC films exhibiting high-brightness CPL with recorded &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full-color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; and PLQY enables high-brightness CPL with advanced anticounterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high-brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ternary Aldehyde&#8211;Copper&#8211;Iridium Catalysis Enables Stereodivergent Allylation via &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization of Primary Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of unprotected primary amines has been developed using aldehyde/Cu/Ir ternary catalysis. This catalytic system enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Notably, this method establishes a sophisticated asymmetric induction model for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine&#8208;containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of primary &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH2 group. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally&#160;&gt;20:1 dr and&#160;&gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the asymmetric induction model for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of primary amines was meticulously elucidated through comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Chloromethylation Modified Pyranonitrile&#8208;Based Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Selective One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;modification strategy employing a chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production of covalent microporous polymers (CMPs). The H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP namely DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl reached 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, which is 6.7 times greater than that of the unmodified photocatalyst. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding that of most reported polymer photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production utilizing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)&#8208;based photocatalysts represents a crucial green technology for achieving solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Proper material design is paramount to improve the dispersity and charge transfer of CMPs for enhanced H2O2 production performance. Herein, a post&#8208;modification strategy employing chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production. The simple one&#8208;step chloromethylation reaction simultaneously achieved two objectives: One is enhanced hydrophilicity through the hydrolysis of cyanogen groups in the pyranonitrile unit to carboxyl groups, the other&#160;is the improved O2 adsorption and charge transfer by incorporating chloromethyl groups. The two objectives synergistically enhanced the H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP named DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl, reaching 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, 6.7&#8208;fold of the unmodified photocatalyst. Moreover, the rate achieved at an O2 atmosphere increased by only 1.8%, highlighting its superior O2 utilization efficiency in air. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding most reported polymer photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results corroborated the predominant role of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway in the H2O2 generation. This work demonstrates the potential of a post&#8208;modification method to significantly enhance H2O2 production performance directly from water and air.

         <title>Equalized Dual Emissions from Copper Complexes via Multichannel Balanced Intersystem Crossing: Toward 100% Quantum Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissions containing equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence are achieved by a copper iodide complex QtBCzTTPPCuI, which exhibits &#8764;100% photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high twofold increased external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% among pure&#8208;yellow spin&#8208;coated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, owing to the contributions of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer excited states to intersystem crossing.








Abstract
Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, &#8764;100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Cyclization of Amide&#8208;Type 1,6&#8208;Enynes Enabled by H&#8211;[Pd]&#8211;CN Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Three distinctive asymmetric 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, have been developed, providing a modular synthetic platform for various chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are also conducted. 








Abstract
Enantioselective cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been extensively developed as it offers an effective way to obtain chiral cyclic compounds. Herein, we report a divergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;substituted propiolamides, which allows for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Three distinctive cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, were successfully developed. The product can be selected by using different initial substrates under the same catalytic conditions or by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions for the same initial substrate. This catalytic system boasts broad substrate scope and wide functional&#8208;group compatibility, where a diverse range of substituents on the aryl group and amide nitrogen atom were tolerated. The combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations revealed the fundamental role of the ligand in regioselectivity and the role of H2O in the sequential cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation reactions. H2O can lower the energy barrier of the reductive elimination step, thus promoting the reaction toward the target product formation.

&lt;p&gt;Three distinctive asymmetric 1,6-enyne cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, have been developed, providing a modular synthetic platform for various chiral &#947;-lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are also conducted. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective cyclization of 1,6-enynes has been extensively developed as it offers an effective way to obtain chiral cyclic compounds. Herein, we report a divergent palladium-catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-allyl-substituted propiolamides, which allows for the efficient synthesis of chiral &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Three distinctive cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, were successfully developed. The product can be selected by using different initial substrates under the same catalytic conditions or by fine-tuning the reaction conditions for the same initial substrate. This catalytic system boasts broad substrate scope and wide functional-group compatibility, where a diverse range of substituents on the aryl group and amide nitrogen atom were tolerated. The combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations revealed the fundamental role of the ligand in regioselectivity and the role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the sequential cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation reactions. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O can lower the energy barrier of the reductive elimination step, thus promoting the reaction toward the target product formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Ligate and Release Strategy Based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;Mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consecutive, controllable, and revertible new&#8208;to&#8208;nature ligation and cleavage strategy has been rationally devised to selectively visualize and manipulate biomolecules of interest. The photoclick cycloaddition between allenyl phenyl ether motifs and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone analogues installed a terminal allyl handle at the exocyclic site, thereby enabling on&#8208;demand Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation to release phenolic payloads (copyright permission obtained from BioRender).








Abstract
The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify, and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labeling and delabeling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for a controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in built release mechanism to restore their original state.

         <title>Turing&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Precise Peptide Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Turing&#8208;structured COF membrane with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures is created via the modulation based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry. The resulting COF membrane exhibits simultaneously enhanced water permeation and molecular sieving properties, demonstrating its great potential in the separation of high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Turing structures have emerged as promising features for separation membranes, enabling significantly enhanced water permeation due to their ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities. So far, Turing structures are constrained by the highly cross&#8208;linked and heterogeneous porosities, impeding them from the application of molecular separations requiring loose but regular pore structures. This work reports a covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membrane with nanoscale striped Turing structures for fast and precise molecular separations. Porous and hydrophilic modulation layers based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry are constructed on polymeric substrates, which are capable of enhancing the uptake and controlled release of the activator of amines during synthesis. The appropriately reduced diffusion rate triggers the phenomenon of &#8220;local activation and lateral inhibition&#8221; arising from thermodynamic instability, creating Turing structures with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures. The Turing&#8208;type COF membranes exhibit a water permeance of 45.0 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is approximately 13 times greater than the non&#8208;Turing membranes, and an ultrahigh selectivity of up to 638 for two model peptides. This work demonstrates the feasibility that Turing structures with ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities can be created in COF membranes and underscores their superiority in molecular separations, including but not limited to high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Modular Access to Arylethylamines Enabled by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroarylation of Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, affording various valuable arylethylamines with exclusive regiocontrol. The use of NHC&#9472;Ni catalyst was crucial to achieve high efficiency and selectivity. In particular, with bulky chiral NHC ligands, enantioenriched arylethylamines were prepared in high efficiency with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cu6Sn5 Alloy Electrocatalysts for Formaldehyde Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Bipolar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; alloy was developed as a high&#8208;performance, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst for the anodic formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation (FOD) reaction. When paired with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it enables a formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer, facilitating energy&#8208;efficient bipolar hydrogen production and the generation of value&#8208;added formate.








Abstract
Aldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers an attractive pathway for energy&#8208;saving bipolar hydrogen production with combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of 200% while converting formaldehyde into value&#8208;added formate. Herein we report the design and synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free Cu6Sn5 alloy as a highly effective electrocatalyst for formaldehyde electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating a geometric current density of 915&#160;&#177;&#160;46&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many noble metal electrocatalysts reported previously. The formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer delivers 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 0.124&#160;V, and a current density of 486&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V without any iR compensation and exhibits nearly 200% faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 88&#160;h long&#8208;term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.

         <title>Phosphinoisocyanide/Alkyne Cycloaddition: Generation of Azaphospholylidene (NPHC) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare examples of nitrogen phosphorus heterocyclic carbene (NPHC) complexes of group 6 and 7 metals arise from a facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of phosphinoisocyanides (LnM&#8208;CNPR2) with activated alkynes. The NPHC ligands are shown to be comparatively &#960;&#8208;acidic and the group 6 examples undergo facile transfer of the intact carbene to gold(I) centres.








Abstract
Phosphinoisocyanide complexes undergo facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions with activated alkynes to afford the first azaphospholylidene complexes which are rare examples of N,P&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NPHC). In addition to quantifying the donor/acceptor properties of this new class of carbene, their transmetalation reactions are also described.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Triggered Orbital Hybridization in FeMn Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Toward Sabatier&#8208;Optimized Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn dual&#8208;atom catalyst on a porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is synthesized via a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. The defect&#8208;mediated coordination strengthens Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization, optimizing adsorption energy toward Sabatier optimality. The catalyst delivers a 0.921&#160;V half&#8208;wave potential for alkaline oxygen reduction and excellent Zn&#8208;air battery performance.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSAs), leveraging synergistic dual&#8208;site interactions, represent a promising frontier in electrocatalysis. However, the precise synthesis of dual&#8208;atom pairs and fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic structures remain significant challenges. Herein, we construct a defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn&#8208;DSA anchored on a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeMnDSA/dNC) through a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. This defect modulation strategy effectively stabilizes dual atomic pairs while optimizing electronic structures to approach Sabatier's optimality, significantly boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The FeMnDSA/dNC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.921&#160;V in alkaline media, with assembled zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrating 291&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density and stable charge/discharge cycling for over 500&#160;h. Theoretical calculations reveal that defect&#8208;mediated coordination adjacent to Fe&#8208;Mn diatomic centers triggers charge redistribution, suppressing antibonding orbital populations while strengthening Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization. This modulation weakens O&#9472;O bonding through optimized *OOH adsorption configurations, thereby enhancing ORR kinetics. The present work provides valuable insights into the precise modulation and the underlying mechanisms of DSAs, advancing the design of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Soft Self&#8208;Assembly from Melt: The Ubiquitous Heat Capacity Hump and Spontaneous Melt Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transition from melt to most complex liquid crystal (LC) phases is weak 1st order but is preceded by a large heat capacity maximum. In addition, a chiral liquid forms through another transition before that to the LC, despite the compounds being achiral. We investigate these poorly understood phenomena experimentally and develop a statistical theory that fits the experiments remarkably well, giving new insights into the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly and pre&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We investigate two unusual phenomena in self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic molecules from isotropic (Iso) melt: a heat&#8208;capacity (Cp) maximum and spontaneous formation of the recently discovered chiral liquid (Iso*). Based on experiments on new nonchiral monomers, dimers, and polymers, we construct a statistical theory that shows why many complex meso&#8208;structures form in two stages: continuous equilibrium growth of nano&#8208;clusters in melt through strong interactions, causing the Cp&#8208;maximum, followed by establishment of positional long&#8208;range order (LRO) through a weak first&#8208;order transition. We also show why many achiral compounds additionally form an intermediate chiral Iso* liquid through what we find is a second&#8208;order transition. We propose that the first process is equivalent to &#8220;supramolecular polymerization&#8221; in solutions, where the lack of intercluster interaction rules out LRO. Furthermore, we argue that separation into a broad and a sharp transition is universal in condensed matter where strong interactions by themselves cannot lead to LRO, either because the clusters are 1D or due to strong frustration. Clusters must first grow to critical size when, at Tc, the combined weak interactions reach &#8764;kBTc, prompting LRO formation. A situation similar to that in soft self&#8208;assembly is seen in spin ordering in magnetic crystals, but only near 0&#160;K.

         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity Versus Surface Activity for Selective C&#9472;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of 45 general descriptors was developed to capture the diverse structural features of a wide range of MOFs, enabling the study of MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for C&#9472;H borylation. This analysis revealed key factors that govern sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, allowing for the rational design of Ni catalysts with up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#9472;H borylation. By analyzing over 470&#160;000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#9472;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#9472;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.

Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates exhibit reasonably photostable and intense broadband sky&#8208;blue emission, originating from self&#8208;trapped excitons. The self&#8208;trapping of excitons occurs due to strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling, which is created by elastic structural distortion on the atomic scale. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering studies reveal the local structural distortion to be crafted by off&#8208;centering the copper atom.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional metal halides have received significant recognition attributable to their intriguing optoelectronic properties, which instigate the emergence of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) accompanied by intense broadband emissions. However, fundamental crystal structural origin of such STE is still elusive. Herein, we have synthesized Cu(I)&#8208;based mixed halide, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates (NPs) using room temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation method, which showed an intense blue emission with broad line&#8208;width, large Stokes shift, long photoluminescence lifetime, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8764;75%. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL intensity and line&#8208;width analysis unfolded strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling in NP sample. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis determines the local Cu off&#8208;centering, which provides the required lattice anharmonicity and softness for intense STE in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 NPs. The existence of such soft lattice structure associated with low&#8208;energy phonons was verified by sound velocity, Raman spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature heat capacity measurements. The fluorescence microscopy and super&#8208;resolution optical imaging were implemented at single&#8208;particle level which exhibited minimal temporal PL intermittency with reasonable photostability under high&#8208;intensity illumination. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the intense broadband emission of NPs are &#160;accompanied by the local atomic off&#8208;centering&#8208;driven lattice deformation during photo&#8208;excitation process.

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport Through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes Toward High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Loading Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. The composite gel polymer electrolyte facilitates high&#8208;performance Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cell. 








Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt;4.0&#160;V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What's more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Specially, cells with 8.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Preparation of Cyclic Olefin Polymers via Group Transfer Radical Cyclopolymerization for High Performance in Anode&#8208;Free Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP) method has been developed for the precise synthesis of functionalized cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) using non&#8208;conjugated diene monomers. Through rational monomer design, various polar groups are incorporated into the COP backbones. The resulting polymers exhibit high molecular weights, low dispersities, controllable chain sequences, and high structural diversity. The polymer can function as a robust interphase layer, enhancing the reversibility of lithium plating/stripping in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) are of high importance in optical and medical materials. These materials are typically synthesized via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene derivatives, using metallocene catalysts, followed by high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation catalyzed by noble metals. However, the complex synthetic processes, the continuous use of expensive catalysts, and the need to remove metal residues remain substantial barriers in COP production. In contrast, radical cyclopolymerization of dienes, which eliminates the need for metal catalysis and hydrogenation, offers a promising alternative for COP synthesis. Nevertheless, chain transfer reactions hinder the radical polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated dienes. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy, group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP), which effectively suppresses chain transfer and enables radical polymerization of dienes to yield COPs. This approach allows for the production of a broad range of sequence&#8208;regulated COPs with high molecular weights and low dispersity. Density functional theory calculations support the proposed GTRCP mechanism, highlighting its efficiency and selectivity, driven by substantial thermodynamic forces. The resulting COPs demonstrate great potential as the interphase layer materials in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries, significantly enhancing the cycling performance towards practical energy storage applications.

         <title>Interfacial Water Structure Modulation on Unconventional Phase Non&#8208;Precious Metal Alloy Nanostructures for Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free CuNi alloy nanostructures with unconventional hcp/fcc heterophase has been successfully achieved. Notably, hcp/fcc CuNi nanoalloys demonstrate much superior catalytic performance toward ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrate than the common fcc CuNi counterparts. Mechanism studies reveal that the hcp/fcc CuNi alloys facilitate the formation of K+&#8211;H2O, enhance the interfacial water dissociation, and create high *H coverage, thereby boosting the ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been recognized as a sustainable route for nitrate removal and value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Regulating the surface active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial but remains a formidable challenge, especially in neutral electrolytes, greatly limiting the highly selective NH3 formation. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of heterophase hcp/fcc non&#8208;precious CuNi alloy nanostructures for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis in neutral media. Significantly, hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 exhibits excellent performance with NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.1% and 57.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, respectively. In situ studies suggest that the high proportion of interfacial K+ ion hydrated water (K+&#8211;H2O) on hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 creates high *H coverage via boosting interfacial water dissociation, enabling the rapid hydrogenation kinetics for NH3 synthesis. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior NO3RR performance of hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 originates from both the existence of hcp phase to improve the electroactivity and the high Ni content to guarantee an efficient active hydrogen supply. The strong interaction between Ni and Cu also optimizes the electronic structures of Cu sites to realize fast intermediate conversions with low energy barriers. This work provides a novel strategy to optimize surface *H behavior via tuning interfacial water structure by crystal phase control.

Transfer learning&#8208;driven SERS to elucidate mixtures with unknown composition and ratios.








Abstract
Identifying and quantifying compounds in unknown mixtures represents the ultimate goal of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy but remains a significant challenge in real&#8208;world applications. Existing machine learning&#8208;driven SERS methods are limited by their reliance on prior knowledge of mixture composition, while time&#8208;consuming experimental testing of all possibilities is not feasible. We integrate the molecular specificity of SERS with an adaptive transfer learning (TL) strategy to sequentially identify and quantify carnitine components in 11 unknown binary, ternary, and quaternary multicarnitine mixtures, achieving 100% identification accuracy and a mean quantitation error of only 3%. All models are trained solely on pure compound spectral data, enabling scalable, qualitative, and quantitative analysis of complex, unseen multiplex spectra&#8212;without requiring costly and time&#8208;consuming training data collection for every possible mixture. This predictive transfer learning&#8208;driven approach marks a transformative leap for practical SERS applications, allowing accurate analysis of complex mixtures without prior knowledge of components or ratios.

         <title>Elucidating Ligand Exchange Dynamics of Hexacyanochromate&#8208;Based Redox Mediators in Aqueous Iron&#8208;Chromium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange between cyanide and hydroxide in hexacyanochromate negolyte was caused by the disruption of coordination environment of the redox mediator ([Cr(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8722;), with a critical factor as an elevated pH during electrochemical cycle. To mitigate this electrolyte co&#8208;modulation strategy is introduced, optimizing the [OH&#8722;]/[CN&#8722;] ratios stabilize the redox mediator, ensuring long&#8208;term electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aqueous redox flow batteries (AQRFBs) are revolutionizing energy storage by integrating sustainability with cutting&#8208;edge innovation. Among them, Iron&#8208;Chromium RFBs (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low&#8208;cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K3[Cr(CN)6]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long&#8208;term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%&#8211;77%. This research provides valuable insights into the degradation pathways of hexacyanochromate&#8208;based negolyte and emphasizes the importance of optimized electrolyte design for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Orthogonal Multiple Hydrogen Bonds of Nucleobases Enable Precise Tunability of DNA&#8208;Polymer Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple hydrogen bond (MHB) interactions for hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNA chains are highly selective and orthogonal, owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity. Orthogonal MHBs enable us to tailor DNA nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic domain, amplifying the production of diverse functional DNA nanostructures.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures manifest enhanced stability and chemical diversity for various applications such as sensing, imaging, and immune modulation. However, the functionality of the hydrophobic polymer in the core is often disregarded, leading to limited property tunability of DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures. Herein, we have successfully fabricated tunable DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures by harnessing orthogonal multiple hydrogen bonds (MHBs) within both the core and shell domains. Distinct DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures, consisting of hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNAs, have been rationally designed and successfully constructed. The DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures undergo the controlled morphological transformation triggered by hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and surface functionalization by hydrophilic DNA chains. Owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity, the robust MHB interactions for complementary DNAs and nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers are highly selective and orthogonal. Most significantly, the reported core&#8208;driven morphological transformation and surface functionalization of the shell layer are general to expand the structural and properties tunability of DNA nanostructures with different DNA sequences. This work provides an efficient and novel route to precisely modulating DNA&#8208;polymer core&#8208;shell nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic core through orthogonal MHBs.

         <title>Quantitative Tracking of Apoptotic Caspase&#8208;3 In Vivo for Early Evaluation of Radiation Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescence probe was developed to accurately quantify caspase&#8208;3 induced by radiotherapy in vivo by emitting a dual signal at 1550&#160;nm as a reference and response signal, respectively. The detection limit for caspase&#8208;3 was determined to be 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. The established early efficacy evaluation system can effectively predict the therapeutic outcome of cancer radiotherapy and guide the optimization of treatment plans.








Abstract
Traditional responsive fluorescent probes are predominantly restricted to qualitative biomarker detection, incapable of delivering real&#8208;time quantitative analysis or spatial mapping of protease activity in vivo, which is essential for elucidating disease progression. To overcome this, a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) probe (DCNP@IR&#8208;806) was developed by conjugating caspase&#8208;3&#8208;specific peptide substrates and sensitizer molecules (IR&#8208;806) to lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP). DCNP@IR&#8208;806 achieves single&#8208;channel emission at 1550&#160;nm under dual excitation, facilitating self&#8208;calibrated quantification and real&#8208;time monitoring of activated caspase&#8208;3 in vivo. Radiotherapy induces tumor cell apoptosis, thereby activating caspase&#8208;3, which subsequently triggers a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II FL signal change of DCNP@IR&#8208;806. The ratiometric signal demonstrates a linear correlation with caspase&#8208;3 concentration, achieving a detection limit of 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. Then, an early efficacy assessment system capable of predicting radiotherapy outcomes within 12 h post&#8208;treatment was constructed, markedly expediting evaluation compared to traditional methods that require weeks. This rapid, precise, and user&#8208;friendly assessment facilitates timely optimization of therapeutic regimens to enhance efficacy while minimizing side effects. This platform represents a significant advancement in precision oncology by transitioning from qualitative imaging to in situ quantitative biomarker tracking.

         <title>Switching Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation Toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) photocatalyst with medium&#8208;spin active sites, in which both the unpaired electrons and eg orbital occupancy allow to selectively generate &#8226;CH2OH intermediates at moderate *OH coverage and promote the C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH, leading to efficient photocatalytic conversion of CH4 to ethanol without the addition of strong oxidizing reagents.

The selective oxidation of methane (CH4) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH3, &#8226;OCH3, and &#8226;CH2OH). Herein, we developed a medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo&#8208;oxidize CH4 to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the eg orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon&#8208;containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH3 versus &#8226;CH2OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol yield of 372 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is &#8764;3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions. Our study suggests an attractive potential of converting CH4 to multicarbon products by modulating spin states of the catalytic sites.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electron&#8208;delocalized strategy to unlock FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+ spin channel, inducing intermolecular electron transfer of two PMS for selective 1O2 generation. The directed electron transfer behavior not only maintains the catalyst stability, but also immensely reduces the 1O2 generation energy barrier and improves the PMS utilization.








Abstract
Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#9472;O&#9472;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8722; and SO5&#8226;&#8722; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8722; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8722; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48&#160;h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.

         <title>From Corrosion to Creation: Interfacial De&#8208;Electronation Drives Hydrogenation&#8208;Energy Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative approach is proposed to redefine corrosion engineering, enabling sustainable energy production and the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals and metal&#8211;organic frameworks, while simultaneously addressing critical limitations such as slow reaction kinetics, energy loss, and challenges in hydrogen storage. 








Abstract
Metal corrosion, conventionally perceived as a destructive phenomenon driven by de&#8208;electronation, imposes significant economic burdens and safety hazards. To repurpose corrosion into a valuable resource, we demonstrate a macroscopic corrosion battery concept that harnesses galvanic corrosion to drive the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), high&#8208;value chemicals, and energy generation, challenging conventional corrosion mitigation paradigms. By spatially segregating the corrosion process, the system couples anodic metal de&#8208;electronation with MOF deposition while integrating diverse cathodic reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction, electrocatalytic hydrogenation, and hydrogen peroxide reduction with remarkable accelerated kinetics, thereby achieving universal MOFs and chemical synthesis with high electron and atom utilization efficiencies. The prototype system demonstrates concurrent production of p&#8208;aminophenol (14.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and zinc oxalate (86.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) while generating 34.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 of electrical power. Techno&#8208;economic analysis establishes the inaugural empirical validation of economic feasibility for corrosion&#8208;driven energy&#8208;matter symbiosis, highlighting its high gross profit. Transcending conventional corrosion engineering boundaries for inorganic synthesis, this methodology mechanistically deciphers MOF growth kinetics and advanced system design. By broadening the scope of corrosion utilization, this work enables a paradigm shift from damage mitigation to value creation, providing a blueprint for sustainable chemical&#8208;energy ecosystems.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature, High&#8208;Voltage, Flame&#8208;Retardant Electrolyte for 4.8&#160;V Li||NCM94 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we construct a highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient CEI based on a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for stabilizing Li||NCM94 battery at high voltage (4.8&#160;V) and extreme temperatures (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries attract great interest, but their poor safety and cycling performance hinder their applications, especially with high cut&#8208;off voltage nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;voltage, wide&#8208;temperature, and flame&#8208;retardant electrolyte for Li|| LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) batteries with excellent cycling performance through constructing highly Li+&#8208;conductive, lithophilic gradient cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). Such CEI exhibits a gradual decrease in C&#9472;F and a gradient increase in LiF and LiBxOy from the outside to the inside, which effectively inhibits structural degradation of the NCM94 cathode. With an excellent CEI, Li|| NCM94 batteries show outstanding cycling stability and wide temperature applicability (&#8722;40&#8764;60&#160;&#176;C). The battery could exhibit a capacity retention of 87% after 200 cycles at 4.8&#160;V, and deliver 112% (or 56%) of their room&#8208;temperature capacity at 60 &#176;C and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, as&#8208;constructed 7.6&#160;Ah pouch cell could run 145 cycles with an energy density of 541&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work provides the guidance on designing electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces for wide&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Design Strategy for Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes: Regulated Active Groups Enable High Capacity and Voltage in Aqueous and Seawater Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heteroaromatic organic small&#8208;molecule (DPPZ&#8208;CN) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity. When DPPZ&#8208;CN is used as the cathode material in aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs), the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery demonstrates exceptional capacity, voltage plateau, and lifespan, even maintaining superior electrochemical performance in seawater, which highlights its potential for challenging environments.








Abstract
Organic materials demonstrate significant potential as electrodes for aqueous batteries, owing to their high theoretical capacity, structurally tunable frameworks, and sustainable material accessibility. Small&#8208;molecule organic electrode materials enable better active&#8208;site accessibility but remain challenged by the dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, which deteriorates cycling stability, and poor conductivity due to limited conjugation. Here, we designed an organic small&#8208;molecule cathode material (DPPZ&#8208;CN) featuring functional pyridine, pyrazine, and cyano groups. Its highly conjugated fused N&#8208;heteroaromatic structure provides strong intermolecular interactions and high reactivity, resulting in improved stability, capacity, and conductivity. The electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group further modulates electron delocalization and molecular orbitals, enhancing electronic conductivity and operating voltage. Through combined theoretical and experimental studies, including operando synchrotron FT&#8208;IR, in situ Raman, ex situ XPS, and 1H NMR, we demonstrate that DPPZ&#8208;CN facilitates efficient dual&#8208;cation storage (Al3+/H+), thereby reducing Al3+ cation repulsion and induced structural distortion. As a result, the Al//DPPZ&#8208;CN battery exhibits outstanding capacity, a well&#8208;defined voltage plateau, and an extended lifespan in organic aluminum batteries with aqueous and seawater electrolytes, highlighting its potential for operation in challenging environments.

         <title>Optimizing Bromine Complexation and Kinetics: a Bisimidazole Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8208;Br Static Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a symmetric bisimidazole&#8208;based complexing agent, [bMImB]Br2, that integrates high N+ atomic charge and low solubility with minimal steric hindrance to enable strong bromine complexation and fast redox kinetics, enabling ZnBr static batteries with high energy density, excellent efficiency, and robust cycling stability.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;bromine (Zn&#8211;Br) static batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage, yet the practical application is hindered by the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off about bromine complexing agents (BCAs) between bromine complexation strength and redox kinetics. Herein, we report a rationally designed bisimidazolium salt, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;1&#8208;yl) butane dibromide ([bMImB]Br&#8322;), which features a symmetric molecular structure that reconciles this contradiction. [bMImB]Br&#8322; demonstrates strong bromine affinity, stemming from its high atomic charge of N+ and low solubility&#8212;properties comparable to those of tetraalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts. Simultaneously, it retains low steric hindrance typical of monoimidazole compounds, thereby enabling fast electrode kinetics. As a result, Zn&#8211;Br batteries incorporating [bMImB]Br&#8322; deliver a high specific energy of 116 Wh&#183;kg&#8315;&#185;, alongside an average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.22% and energy efficiency (EE) of 89.35% at 10 mAh&#183;cm&#8315;2 (0.5 C) for over 150 cycles. Furthermore, the flexible pouch cell maintains a discharge capacity of 110 mAh and 99.7% CE over 100 cycles, even under mechanical deformation. This work offers a generalizable molecular design strategy for developing next&#8208;generation BCAs in halogen&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in Small&#8208;Ring Transfer: Direct Decarboxylative Hydroalkylation of Alkenes via Iron&#8208;Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a catalytic approach for the direct decarboxylation of challenging CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl carboxylic acids using cooperative iron&#8208;thiol catalysis. This strategy enables the efficient generation of valuable radicals that can be incorporated into activated and unactivated alkenes, offering access to elusive chemical space. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive mechanistic studies, supported by experimental, spectroscopic, and DFT data, which offer insights into radical stability in small&#8208;ring systems.








Abstract
Cyclopropanes, especially those substituted with trifluoromethyl (CF3) groups, are valuable scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. Their enhanced bioavailability contributes to the widespread presence of this motif in a variety of bioactive compounds. Despite the development of multiple synthetic strategies, a direct method for transferring CF3&#8208;containing small rings from their most abundant carboxylic acid surrogates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we overcome the challenging decarboxylation of CF3&#8208;cyclopropyl and CF3&#8208;cyclobutyl carboxylic acids while leveraging the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited state of photochemically activated iron complexes. The resulting radicals were then engaged in radical addition to alkenes, followed by a timely hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by a thiol donor. This efficient iron&#8208;thiol cooperative catalysis enables, for the first time, facile hydroalkylation of alkenes with highly reactive CF3&#8208;containing cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl radicals. Synergistic experimental, spectroscopic, and density functional theory (DFT) studies support the proposed reaction mechanism. Additionally, we employed the radical stabilization energy (RSE) scale, developed using isodesmic equations computed at the DFT level, aiming to provide a better understanding of the reluctant radical decarboxylation of small&#8208;strained cycloalkanes.

         <title>Accelerating Responsive RNA Release Through Structural Optimization of Disulfide&#8208;Containing Acyl Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a redox&#8208;responsive strategy for precise RNA control via postsynthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation. These introduced disulfide&#8208;containing acyl groups can be selectively cleaved upon exposure to both exogenous and endogenous glutathione (GSH), enabling traceless RNA release and functional recovery. This approach offers a versatile tool for modifying and manipulating RNAs of diverse lengths or origins.








Abstract
Chemical methods for modifying and manipulating RNA are crucial for advancing its biological studies and applications. While postsynthetic 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation has enabled on&#8208;demand RNA activation, its application to larger, biologically relevant RNAs remains challenging. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;responsive RNA modification via postsynthetic acylation to functionalize RNAs. Three strategies were developed to introduce multiple disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts at 2&#8242;&#8208;OH positions, temporarily blocking RNA function. Exposure to glutathione (GSH) can trigger the traceless release of RNA and restore its biological function. We demonstrate the versatility of this redox&#8208;responsive strategy with RNA constructs of varying lengths, including short synthetic RNA, single guide RNA (sgRNA) as well as longer messenger RNA (mRNA). Furthermore, these disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts respond to endogenous GSH, restoring mRNA translation without the need for cytotoxic exogenous stimuli. Taken together, these results offer a simple and generalizable method for modifying and modulating RNAs regardless of length or origin through structural optimization of acyl groups for facilitating RNA release, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis From CO2 and Nitrate via Porphyrin and Metalloporphyrin MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;metallated PMOF for adaptive electrocatalytic urea synthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;), addressing concentration&#8208;dependent challenges. PMOF facilitates&#160;*HNO2&#8208;*CO2 coupling under concentrated NO3&#8722;, while Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) promotes&#160;*NO&#8208;*CO coupling in dilute conditions, with theoretical calculations and in situ studies revealing distinct C&#8208;N coupling pathways for sustainable urea production.








Abstract
Traditional urea synthesis via the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process suffers from high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Electrocatalytic urea production from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) under ambient conditions offers a sustainable alternative, yet challenges persist due to variable NO3&#8722; concentrations and competing side reactions. Herein, we propose porphyrin metal&#8208;organic framework (PMOF) and Cu&#8208;porphyrin MOF (Cu&#8208;PMOF) catalysts for NO3&#8722; concentration&#8208;adaptive urea synthesis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that PMOF weakly adsorbs *NO2 via hydrogen bonding, favoring its coupling with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF strongly binds *NO2 at Cu sites, facilitating spontaneous *NO/*CO coupling to form *OCNO intermediates under dilute NO3&#8722; conditions. Experimentally, PMOF achieves a urea yield of 28.6&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 23.1% in 0.1&#160;M NO3&#8722;, whereas Cu&#8208;PMOF outperforms in 0.05&#160;M NO3&#8722; with a yield of 25.5&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and FE of 52.7%. In situ spectroscopy and mechanistic study confirm distinct pathways: PMOF relies on stepwise coupling of *HNO2 with *CO2, while Cu&#8208;PMOF enables consecutive *NO&#8208;*CO coupling. This work highlights adaptive electrocatalyst design for efficient C&#8208;N coupling, advancing sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>A Phenomenological Symmetry Rule for Chemical Reactivity Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general symmetry rule emerges from the study of charge transfer complexes in cavities that points to an underlying framework to the predict the outcome of chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling.








Abstract
Symmetry is known to strongly influence the course of a chemical reaction. It has also been found to play a key role in vibrational strong coupling (VSC), where it can influence the outcome of chemical reactions or alter chemical equilibria. However, the precise nature of this effect and its extent remains elusive. To further explore the role of vibrational symmetry, we have investigated the equilibrium constants of different charge transfer complexes, in particular of isomers of trimethyl benzene belonging to different point groups from which a general symmetry rule emerges. We describe the strongly coupled system by a direct product of irreducible representations associated with the complexes and the cavity. As a consequence, the coupled vibration is associated with a new irreducible representation that projects differently on the reaction coordinate of the charge transfer complexation, reflecting the changes in the equilibrium constants. This phenomenological symmetry rule points to a general underlying framework for predicting the outcome of chemical reactivity under VSC.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol for various largely underexplored N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds, utilizing two powerful and isolable building blocks: N&#8208;CH2F thio carbamoyl fluorides and N&#8208;CH2F carbamoyl fluorides. The reactivity of fluorine atoms located at different positions of the two building blocks toward nucleophilic substitution was investigated both experimentally and theoretically.








Abstract
The distinctive chemical properties of fluorine atoms have enabled fluorine&#8208;containing compounds to make significant strides in the pharmaceutical and materials fields. However, due to the very limited synthetic methods, the enormous potential of N&#8208;monofluoromethyl compounds has not yet been unlocked.

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Derived Polyanionic Crosslinked Gel Interfacial Layer with Ion&#8208;Sieving and Ion&#8208;Regulating Capabilities for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered interface layer with ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capacity is constructed to stabilize Zn anodes by simultaneously restricting SO&#8324;2&#8315; diffusion and creating high&#8208;conductivity pathways for Zn2&#8314;, thereby mitigating side reactions. Sodium lignosulfonate forms a molecular adsorbent layer that chelates Zn2&#8314; to regulate uniform deposition, achieving high performance of Zn ion batteries.








Abstract
The severe side reactions and rampant dendrite growth on the zinc (Zn) electrode significantly hinder the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, we fabricate a multifunctional interfacial layer composed of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polyanionic gel featuring ion&#8208;sieving and ion&#8208;regulating capabilities that effectively protects the Zn anode. The abundant &#9472;SO3&#8722; groups in the polyanionic gel optimize the Zn2+ solvent sheath structure while simultaneously providing ion&#8208;sieving function, which significantly facilitates Zn2+ migration. The lignin derivatives are pre&#8208;adsorbed onto the Zn anode surface, directing nucleation along the Zn (002) plane and offering electrostatic shielding effects to facilitate uniform Zn2+ deposition. Additionally, the polyanionic gel inhibits water activity by forming strong hydrogen bonds with water, while the PVDF layer adjacent to Zn electrode significantly reduces water&#8208;induced side reactions. Consequently, the Zn electrodes incorporating this protective layer demonstrated stable and efficient deposition/stripping behaviors across a wide range of current densities. The Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells demonstrate remarkable cycling stability, maintaining the capacity of 176.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 and 101.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This innovative strategy presents a promising approach to the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Atom La2 Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an ultra&#8208;fast printing technology, we have successfully embedded diatomic lanthanum sites onto a graphene framework, which shows excellent ORR performance. The La2&#8208;N6 configuration structure can effectively reduce the reaction barrier of RDS and promote effective charge transfer, thus enhancing the catalytic process, on which the intermediates and structural evolution were well uncovered by combining advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Rare earth lanthanum element has a large atomic radius, multi&#8208;shell orbital electrons, and Fenton&#8208;like reaction inertia, on which a localized high&#8208;coordination structure can be easily formed for the favorable adsorption of reaction intermediates. However, for single&#8208;atom lanthanum sites, due to the loss of all the outmost s and d electrons, the practically vacuous outmost orbitals are stable but sleepy for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we synthesize a novel dual&#8208;atom La catalyst onto N&#8208;doped graphene (La2&#8208;NG) by a Joule ultrafast heating method, which shows a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.893&#160;V for the ORR. The La2&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52&#160;V and a maximal power density of 192&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of the La2&#8208;N6 moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La2&#8208;N6 structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.

The La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-NG-assembled zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrates a great open circuit voltage of 1.52&#160;V and a maximal power density of 192&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Operando X-ray absorption spectra reveal the change of valence states of La and the dynamic structural evolution of the La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; moiety embedded onto the graphene during the ORR, through which the adsorption/desorption of oxygen reduction intermediates can be reasonably regulated. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; structure can decrease the reaction energy barrier and promote charge transfer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Cryptographic Key&#8208;Based Fluorescence Encryption Enabled by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral fluorescent MOF with lock&#8208;and&#8208;key responsiveness to PEA enantiomers is reported. Integrated into a flexible sensor, it enables visual detection of enantiomeric excess. Leveraging PEA enantiomers as cryptographic keys, a quadruply encrypted barcode system is developed, representing a first demonstration of high&#8208;security chiral encryption.








Abstract
Increasing threats of data forgery breaches necessitate the development of advanced encryption strategies beyond traditional cryptographic methods. Fluorescence encryption has emerged as a promising alternative, yet current systems suffer from low security due to simple, reversible stimuli responses. Here, we introduce a novel lock&#8208;and&#8208;key encryption system using a chiral cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic framework (CDMOF), termed Zole@CDMOF (Zole&#160;=&#160;acetylated benzoimidazole), for enantioselective discrimination of phenylethylamine (PEA) enantiomers.Confined Zole serves as the lock, while PEA enantiomers act as the key, selectively triggering fluorescence turn&#8208;on via acetyl&#9472;O bond cleavage and restoring excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of deacetylated Zole. Mechanistic studies reveal that enantioselectivity arises from thermodynamic differences and distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between PEA enantiomers. To enhance practical application, Zole@CDMOF is fabricated into a flexible sensor via scotch tape strategy, enabling visual indexing of enantiomeric excess. Additionally, we propose a barcode chiral encryption model, establishing a quadruply encrypted system with ultra&#8208;high security&#8212;allowing only one out of approximately two million keys to decrypt. This study pioneers the first chiral cryptographic key in fluorescence encryption, paving the way for ultra&#8208;secure encryption, advanced chiral sensing, and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Spring&#8208;Like Behavior in [8]Helicene Diimides: How Helical Pitch Governs Optical Anisotropy and Electronic Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the imide nitrogen atoms of [8]helicene diimides with different alkyl chains allows for precise control over the helical pitch of their backbones. This has a profound impact on the molecular packing, chiroptical properties, and through&#8208;space electronic conjugation of the molecules. As a result, this approach enables fine&#8208;tuning of the properties of this new class of materials with enhanced optical anisotropy and electronic communication.








Abstract
Helicenes, with their corkscrew&#8208;shaped geometry, have emerged as prototypical molecular springs for engineering chiral functional materials through precise structural modulation. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of [8]helicene diimides ([8]HDIs) and demonstrate that the helical pitch of their backbone can be precisely tuned by bridging the imide nitrogen atoms with alkyl chains of varying lengths (C3&#8211;C6). This approach constrains the molecular geometry to systematically control optical anisotropy, chiroptical response, and electronic communication. Remarkably, modulation of the helical pitch leads to high optical dissymmetry factors (up to 6.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2) and enhanced through&#8208;space conjugation. Furthermore, we investigate how variations in the helical pitch affect crystal packing in both enantiopure and racemic samples. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide insights into the origins of these properties, highlighting the potential of this strategy for designing advanced chiral materials.

         <title>Branched&#8208;Selective Functionalization of 2&#8208;Alkyl Aziridines Through Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl aziridines was reported, enabling unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling and defluorinative coupling via cleavage of the more hindered and less favored C&#9472;N bond. This strategy also enables a novel remote desaturation reaction of aziridines through a unique &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process. This work offers a modular approach to different alkenyl amine derivatives.








Abstract
Overriding the inherent substrate&#8208;controlled regioselectivity in aziridine activation holds significant potential. It could enable previously inaccessible disconnections from these readily available, strained heterocycles, facilitating the diverse synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing products. In this study, we present a Ni&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic activation of 2&#8208;alkyl (and 2,2&#8208;dialkyl) aziridines, leading to unconventional branched&#8208;selective alkyl Heck&#8208;type coupling with styrenes and reductive defluorinative coupling with trifluoromethyl alkenes. In addition to enabling the functionalization of the N&#8208;adjacent sites of aziridines, this catalyst&#8208;controlled activation strategy triggers an unprecedented reaction framework for aziridines, namely, the remote desaturation via ring&#8208;opening. Notably, detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate the operation of a rare &#8220;self&#8208;terminated&#8221; chain&#8208;walking process, offering a flexible method for remote desaturation that generates alkenyl amines with varying chain lengths. Overall, this study provides a modular approach to access a wide range of alkenyl amine derivatives.

         <title>Non&#8208;Amphiphilic Antimicrobial Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely non&#8208;amphiphilic antimicrobial polymers (APs) that possess significant bioactivity and excellent selectivity are presented. The importance of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is highlighted by segregation of APs on bacterial membrane models and bacteria, a behavior absent in amphiphilic polymers. A supramolecular multivalence is proposed that leads to increased membrane activity without the necessity for hydrophobicity.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a severe threat to modern healthcare and must be addressed to prevent millions of deaths in the coming decades. Antimicrobial polymers (APs) do not provoke resistance and are promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Classic APs possess an amphiphilic structure (cationic and hydrophobic). Herein, we question the necessity of amphiphilicity in APs and find that hydrophobicity is not an essential quality in these polymers. Combining cationic monomers with hydrophilic subunits containing hydrogen bond donors results in excellent antibacterial activity and concurrently low unspecific toxicity. Non&#8208;amphiphilic APs have the unique ability to cluster in isolated membrane regions, creating a supramolecular multivalence that enhances their membrane activity and aggregates bacterial cells. This effect, which only unfolds in the absence of hydrophobicity, opens new possibilities in the design of antimicrobial materials.

         <title>Microhydration Dynamics in Molecular Photoswitches: Equilibrium State Reconfiguration in Imine&#8208;Based Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of molecular photoswitches relies on their structural adaptability in solution. Employing gas&#8208;phase rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemistry, we explore the microhydration of camphorquinone imine and show that water binding shifts the E/Z equilibrium, even reversing relative stabilities, while enabling dynamic motion at low temperatures. These insights reveal the interplay of structure, solvation, and switching energetics.








Abstract
The functional performance of a molecular photoswitch relies strongly on its ability to undergo structural changes in solution. In this context, microsolvation studies in the gas phase provide access to the conformational panorama of these systems in a size&#8208;controlled hydrated environment. Here, we exploit this gas&#8208;phase vantage point alongside quantum&#8208;chemistry calculations to study the structural properties and microhydration dynamics of camphorquinone imine, a chiral molecule holding the functionality to engage in a motor&#8208;like function upon light activation. Using molecular rotational resonance spectroscopy with supersonic jets, we detect and analyze the first&#8208; and second&#8208;order water complexes of the chiral imine. Our findings reveal that initial hydration steps significantly impact the equilibrium between open (E) and closed (Z) forms, culminating in a reversal of relative stability for the switch states. Despite being captured at rotational temperatures near 1 K, we find that water molecules exhibit notable mobility due to the lack of prominent stabilizing secondary interactions. Additionally, the assignment of a key higher&#8208;energy closed (Z) water complex provides insights into the energy required for switching between (E) and (Z) states during collisional cooling. We discuss these effects and rationalize them in terms of molecular forces and internal dynamics governing early solvation.

In this context, microsolvation studies in the gas phase provide access to the conformational panorama of these systems in a size-controlled hydrated environment. Here, we exploit this gas-phase vantage point alongside quantum-chemistry calculations to study the structural properties and microhydration dynamics of camphorquinone imine, a chiral molecule holding the functionality to engage in a motor-like function upon light activation. Using molecular rotational resonance spectroscopy with supersonic jets, we detect and analyze the first- and second-order water complexes of the chiral imine. Our findings reveal that initial hydration steps significantly impact the equilibrium between open (E) and closed (Z) forms, culminating in a reversal of relative stability for the switch states. Despite being captured at rotational temperatures near 1 K, we find that water molecules exhibit notable mobility due to the lack of prominent stabilizing secondary interactions. Additionally, the assignment of a key higher-energy closed (Z) water complex provides insights into the energy required for switching between (E) and (Z) states during collisional cooling. We discuss these effects and rationalize them in terms of molecular forces and internal dynamics governing early solvation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Step Test for Rapid Screening of Material and Process Parameters for Resin Development in DLP 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an efficient and rapid step test for determining optimum printing parameters in digital light processing (DLP). It enables the testing of 24 printing parameter settings within one print, is easy to implement, and adaptable to other UV polymerization&#8208;based printing methods, thus speeding up the time from resin screening to optimal printing parameters and products. Yet, it only involves simple validation by eye of 3D&#8208;printed test structures. 








Abstract
The success of 3D printing based on vat polymerization by spatially controlled UV light exposure strongly depends on appropriate resins. However, in search of new resins, optimizing a resin's composition as well as its printing parameters can be time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive. To address these challenges, we present a rapid parameter screening that enables efficient evaluation of 24 printing parameter settings within one print focusing on exposure energy, exposure time, and layer thickness as the most crucial process parameters in 3D printing based on digital light processing (DLP). Our step test minimizes the required number of experimental iterations and 3D prints by relying on optical characterization without the need for special analytical devices, making it rapid and accessible for a broad range of users across different disciplines. For a proof of concept, the step test is applied to define optimal printing parameters of three commercial resins and evaluate the polymerization efficiency of two predominantly biobased, noncommercial resins containing either phenylbis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide or curcumin as photoinitiators. With that, we introduce a straightforward test that is easy to implement and adaptable to other UV polymerization&#8208;based printing methods, speeding up the time from resin screening to optimal printing parameters and products.

         <title>Twelvefold Dearomative Esterification of (6,6)Carbon Nanobelt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new carbon nanobelt derivative bearing twelve ester groups has been successfully synthesized from fully conjugated (6,6)carbon nanobelt by the unique Mg&#8208;promoted dearomative esterification. This simple yet powerful method can modulate shape, solubility and host&#8211;guest property of the (6,6)carbon nanobelt. 








Abstract
Carbon nanobelts (CNBs), cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with belt&#8208;shaped topologies, have growing interest as structurally unique and optoelectronically promising nanocarbons. Yet, strategies for their direct and site&#8208;selective functionalization remain scarce. Here, we report a magnesium&#8208;mediated, multifold dearomative esterification of (6,6)CNB, enabling the installation of twelve ester groups in a single transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed regioselective dearomatization patterns, whereas mechanistic studies uncovered a radical&#8208;driven pathway involving oxyiminium intermediate generated in situ from alkyl chloroformates and amide solvents. Computational analysis further indicated that strain release in the CNB framework drives the high degree of functionalization. This methodology not only expands the synthetic toolbox for aromatic nanobelts but also allows tunable modulation of their host&#8211;guest properties via enhanced conformational flexibility.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks With Enhanced Chemical and Photochemical Stability for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stable covalent organic framework (TZ&#8208;COF) incorporating fused&#8208;heterocycle linkages has been synthesized, showing exceptional chemical resilience under harsh conditions and superior photostability relative to traditional double&#8208;bond&#8208;linked COFs. The in situ formation of thiazole linkages provides new protonation sites, enhancing the framework's hydrophilicity, expanding its range of light absorption, and reducing exciton binding energy.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest for their potential in photocatalytic solar fuel generation. However, their intrinsic stability&#8212;particularly the photochemical stability, which influences the durability of their photocatalytic performance&#8212;remains a critical challenge. Here, we present the construction of four robust fused&#8208;heterocycle thiazole&#8208;linked COFs (TZ&#8208;COFs 14&#8211;17) through a facile one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction using chrysene&#8208;6,12&#8208;diamine, aldehydes, and sulfur monomers. The incorporation of thiazole linkages within the fused&#8208;ring building blocks imparts exceptional chemical and photochemical stability to these COFs. They demonstrate high stability in strong acid (12&#160;M HCl), strong base (12&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M MeONa), reducing (1&#160;M NaBH4), and oxidizing (1&#160;M H2O2) agents, along with superior photostability under light degradation tests. Significantly, the in situ formed thiazoles introduce new, robust protonation sites compared to commonly used imine linkages, which improve the hydrophilicity, expand the range of light absorption, and lower the exciton binding energy of the framework. TZ&#8208;COF&#8208;17 achieves an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of up to 33.27&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing many previously reported COF photocatalysts.

         <title>Photosensitizer Repositioning Affords an Enantiocomplementary Enzyme for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we capitalize on the versatility offered by genetic code expansion to develop a proficient photoenzyme for [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions that is enantiocomplementary to our recently developed photoenzyme EnT1.3. By repositioning the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer and subsequent directed evolution, we have developed an efficient, highly selective and oxygen tolerant enzyme for a range of [2 + 2]&#8208;cycloadditions.








Abstract
The combination of genetic code expansion and directed evolution has recently given rise to enantioselective photoenzymes for [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of quinolone and indole derivatives. However, the enzymes reported to date only allow access to one enantiomeric series of the strained cyclobutane products. Here, guided by a crystal structure of our previously engineered enzyme EnT1.3, we show how judicious repositioning of the genetically programmed benzophenone photosensitizer affords an enantiocomplementary [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cyclase, CEnT1.0. Following directed evolution, a proficient and oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoenzyme (CEnT1.4) emerged that promotes [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloadditions of a quinolone derivative with exquisite enantiocontrol (99% e.e.) and substantially enhanced regioselectivity compared with EnT1.3 (r.r. 62:1&#160;vs. 9:1). Structural analysis of CEnT1.4, coupled with molecular dynamic simulations, reveals a well&#8208;sculpted active site pocket that pre&#8208;organises the substrate for regio&#8208; and enantioselective catalysis. This study highlights the versatility offered by genetically programmed (photo)catalytic elements when developing enzymes for altered stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Engineered Proton Transfer Pathways for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a rationally designed catalyst integrating Ni single atoms and NiO nanoclusters on porous carbon nanosheets for electrochemical H2O2 synthesis in solid electrolytes. This catalyst achieves 97% Faradaic efficiency and 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for pure H2O2 production. The study addresses a critical gap in elucidating proton transfer pathways in solid electrolytes during two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SE) cells promise electrochemical synthesis of pure hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722;&#8208;ORR) remain unclear when using&#160;pure water as the proton source. Both Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H&#8208;mediated) and Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER, water&#8208;derived proton&#8208;coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, but their practical dominance under SE conditions lacks experimental validation.

&lt;p&gt;We developed a rationally designed catalyst integrating Ni single atoms and NiO nanoclusters on porous carbon nanosheets for electrochemical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis in solid electrolytes. This catalyst achieves 97% Faradaic efficiency and 356&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; partial current density for pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The study addresses a critical gap in elucidating proton transfer pathways in solid electrolytes during two-electron oxygen reduction reaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer-based solid electrolyte (SE) cells promise electrochemical synthesis of pure hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), yet the protonation mechanisms governing the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-ORR) remain unclear when using&#160;pure water as the proton source. Both Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (LH, surface *H-mediated) and Eley&#8211;Rideal (ER, water-derived proton-coupled) pathways are theoretically plausible, but their practical dominance under SE conditions lacks experimental validation.

         <title>Stable Acrylamide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks via Mannich Polymerization for Efficient Gold Recovery from Complex E&#8208;Waste Leachates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acrylamide&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized through a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization. The resulting frameworks feature irreversible linkages, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and dual C&#9552;O/N&#9472;H coordination sites, enabling exceptional stability and highly selective gold recovery from complex electronic waste leachates.








Abstract
Achieving both high stability and selectivity remains a critical challenge in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient gold recovery. Herein, we present a one&#8208;step Mannich&#8208;type three&#8208;component polymerization involving 1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene, Meldrum's acid, and aromatic diamines to construct a series of acrylamide&#8208;linked COFs (TFB&#8208;PD&#8208;M, TFB&#8208;ND&#8208;M, and TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M). The incorporation of acrylamide linkages enhances &#960;&#8208;conjugation and backbone rigidity, thereby yielding COFs with high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability under extreme conditions. Importantly, the dual coordination sites (C&#9552;O and N&#9472;H) within the acrylamide units enable robust and selective Au3+ binding through synergistic hydrogen bonding and chelation. Notably, TFB&#8208;AD&#8208;M achieves 98.5% selective Au3+ recovery from complex electronic waste leachates, even in the presence of competing metal ions. This work introduces a robust linkage strategy that not only improves COF stability but also facilitates selective metal capture for resource recovery.

         <title>Ru Single Atoms Anchored in Metal Borides Enable Hydrogen Spillover for Superior Electrochemical Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides are developed as high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalysts utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. This strategy facilitates dissociation of water into *H and promotes the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface, thereby synergistically reducing the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. 








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrate represents a promising and sustainable route for valuable ammonia generation. However, a vital challenge in the nitrate reduction reaction is an insufficient supply of active hydrogen (*H) and slow kinetics at a low working potential, which result in low production efficiency and high energy consumption. Here, we report the single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;decorated nanoporous metal borides as a high&#8208;performance electrochemical nitrate reduction electrocatalyst utilizing an atomic&#8208;scale hydrogen spillover effect. Notably, the RuSA/np&#8208;Ni3B exhibits a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.2%, an NH3 yield of 30.4&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1, and an energy efficiency of 39.1% at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;atom Ru anchored in nanoporous Ni3B not only can efficiently dissociate water into *H and simultaneously promote the *H spillover for increasing *H coverage on the surface but also can optimize surface states of Ni3B active centers, which synergistically reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier for converting nitrate into valuable ammonia products. A two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer integrating nitrate reduction reaction with furfuryl alcohol oxidation reaction achieves current density of 1&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.72&#160;V with 100&#160;h stability, improving the energy efficiency and economy of the system.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Stereodivergent Semihydrogenation of Alkynes: Synthesis of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the synergistic catalysis of an 8&#8208;OIQ cobalt catalyst and CH3CN, a series of&#160;E&#8208; and&#160;Z&#8208;alkenes with high stereoselectivity could be synthesized in the semihydrogenation of internal alkynes. Mechanistic studies showed that the acetonitrile plays an important role in controlling isomerization and inhabiting over&#8208;hydrogenation during the conversion process.








Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed semihydrogenation of alkynes is one of the most efficient, sustainable, and environmental&#8208;friendly strategies for accessing stereoisomerically pure olefins. Herein, we report a tridentate nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand (8&#8208;OIQ) promoted cobalt&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent semihydrogenation of internal alkynes; a series of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;alkenes could be synthesized with high stereoselectivity. Besides, this protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance and operates under mild reaction conditions (1&#160;bar H2, room temperature). A preliminary mechanistic study revealed that acetonitrile plays an important role in suppressing over&#8208;reduction and controlling the stereoselectivity in this transformation.

         <title>A Macrocycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Strategy for Interchangeable Screwdriver&#8208;Like on&#8208;Demand Post&#8208;Functionalization of Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform that can be varied for customized applications is achieved through macrocyclic host&#8211;guest interactions. Such a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based COF with introduction of variable functional guests following the working principle of an interchangeable screwdriver. Conceptually different from traditional covalent approach, this work presents interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COF for applications through host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Constructing functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through post&#8208;functionalization constitutes one of the most important approaches to applications, but is frequently plagued by limited reaction types, tedious synthesis of different precursors, and time&#8208;consuming screening of synthetic parameters for COFs. Moreover, their functions are difficult to change once the functionalities are covalently attached to COF skeletons. Herein, we report a macrocycle&#8208;based supramolecular strategy for variable noncovalent post&#8208;functionalization on the same COF platform like an interchangeable screwdriver. As a proof of concept, pillar[5]arene (P5A) with electron&#8208;rich cavity is incorporated into COF as macrocycle host to anchor different electron&#8208;deficient guests of various functions. Such a design allows tunable post&#8208;functionalization of COF through host&#8211;guest interactions for customized utilities, which has been demonstrated by using a series of guests including organic salts for iodine capture and cyano&#8208;based ligands for metal ion separation. Removing the guests enables recycling of COF, consecutive reinstallation of different guests, and continuous use for implementing expected tasks. This work establishes a general noncovalent approach to on&#8208;demand interchangeable post&#8208;functionalization of COFs.

&lt;p&gt;Noncovalent post-functionalization on the same COF platform that can be varied for customized applications is achieved through macrocyclic host&#8211;guest interactions. Such a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated by pillar[5]arene-based COF with introduction of variable functional guests following the working principle of an interchangeable screwdriver. Conceptually different from traditional covalent approach, this work presents interchangeable post-functionalization of COF for applications through host&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: In&#8208;Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 electrolysis is considered a promising strategy for producing valuable chemicals. However, it is challenging to selectively convert CO2 into long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals due to the difficulty of controlling complex C&#9472;C coupling during the reaction process. In their Research Article (e202502740), Takayoshi Ishimoto,] Miho Yamauchi et&#160;al. demonstrate the effective enhancement of in&#8208;situ Raman scattering signals by employing precisely designed electrode structures, which reveal that the crucial step in C&#9472;C coupling is the asymmetric coupling of CO and CH2, thereby advancing CO2 electroreduction to the production of long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals.

         <title>Photoelectric/Photothermal Synergy Activation in Floating Aerogel Cathode Breaks Neutral Triphase Reaction Barriers for High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Responsive Seawater Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated floating catalytic platform based on the rationally designed Janus aerogel has been explored to maximize sunlight utilization and overcome inherent kinetics/mass transport limitations of bifunctional oxygen reactions in neutral triphase systems, enabling a new class of full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery to achieve ultrahigh energy efficiency. It is unveiled that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically improve oxygen reaction kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates the adsorption energetics optimization of reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Harnessing natural resources (solar, seawater) to explore next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage is an intriguing yet challenging task. Here, we establish a unique floating photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activated catalytic platform based on engineered Janus aerogel that overcomes inherent mass transport/kinetics constraints in neutral triphase oxygen reaction systems to enable a full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive seawater battery with ultrahigh energy efficiency. Our approach employs in situ region&#8208;selective assembly of the rationally designed fluorinated donor&#8211;acceptor polymers on carbon&#8208;nanotube aerogel (FMTAPPC), creating a new floatable FMTAPPC photoelectrode with asymmetric wettability, superior photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;response, and bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) catalysis. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration enables floating FMTAPPC to maximize sunlight utilization for interface micro&#8208;environment regulation and adsorbate binding optimization via photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;activation while satisfying paradoxical wetting requirements of OER/ORR, which tunes reaction kinetics and intermediate energetics to remarkably promote both OER/ORR in neutral media. Under sunlight, floating FMTAPPC delivers large current densities for both OER/ORR&#8211;3&#8211;4 fold&#8208;enhancement over dark conditions. This enables the seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air battery to simultaneously improve charge/discharge performance at high rates and deliver ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 128.2%&#8212;surpassing most photo&#8208;assisted batteries. Mechanistic studies unveil that photoelectric/photothermal effects synergistically boost OER/ORR kinetics, while the photoelectric effect dominates intermediate energetics optimization, substantially lowering reaction energy barriers.

         <title>A Multivalent Targeting Strategy for Developing Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Activated Tumor&#8208;Seeking Probe to Guide Precise Surgical Resection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ROS&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe based on FDA&#8208;approved dye was developed using a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. Benefiting from the robust tumor&#8208;targeting ability and efficient ROS response performance, the proposed probe enabled tumor detection across various mice models and allowed for precise delineation of tumor boundaries during surgical navigation, significantly reducing postoperative recurrence in situ. 








Abstract
Optical molecular imaging with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes provides a promising strategy for the visual detection of tumor tissues. However, conventional molecular probes often suffer from poor targeting specificity and low signal contrast during tumor detection. In this work, we developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated tumor&#8208;seeking probe (termed MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2) based on a multivalent biotin&#8208;targeting strategy. A bivalent biotin&#8208;targeting ligand was bonded to an ROS&#8208;responsive molecular scaffold to maximize receptor&#8211;ligand interactions, resulting in significantly stronger tumor affinity and selectivity of the probe. The optical signal of the proposed probe was initially masked and could be selectively activated by overexpressed ROS levels in the tumor microenvironment. This activation led to the specific release of the clinical dye methylene blue (MB), offering high&#8208;contrast NIR fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging signals for precise tumor visualization. MB&#8208;PEG&#8208;Bio2 demonstrated strong tumor selectivity, enabling the detection of tumors in different mice models, including accurate identification of small tumors (&#8764;3&#160;mm). Consequently, the probe could delineate tumor boundaries during fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery, significantly reducing postoperative tumor recurrence.

         <title>A Bioinspired Diazafluorenone Catalytic System for Aerobic Oxidative Deamination of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient biomimetic aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;amino amides and benzylamines into &#945;&#8208;keto amides and aromatic aldehydes is enabled by 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), a new organocatalyst with a simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity.








Abstract
Copper amine oxidases (CAOs) catalyze aerobic oxidation of primary amines into carbonyl compounds, which is an important biological process as well as a useful transformation for organic synthesis. A new bioinspired organocatalyst, 1,8&#8208;diazafluoren&#8208;9&#8208;one (DFO), has been discovered, which exhibits impressive characteristics, including simple structure, high robustness, and strong electrophilicity, enabling it to effectively mimic the function of copper amine oxidases. Oxidative deamination of &#945;&#8208;amino amides presents an attractive approach to access &#945;&#8208;keto amides; however, it is difficult to achieve due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric effect. The diazafluorenone displays high catalytic activity in this transformation, producing various biologically significant &#945;&#8208;keto amides in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the diazafluorenone catalyst is able to promote direct oxidation of benzylamines into aromatic aldehydes, instead of the generally formed product&#8208;reactant imines, which leads to no greater than 50% yields of the desired aldehydes. The current aerobic oxidative deamination proceeds via a pathway similar to the biological process, involving transamination, hydrolysis/aminolysis, and aerobic oxidation.

Porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing the formation of ammonia and hydrogen byproducts.








Abstract
Cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis from low&#8208;concentration NO is important but suffers from low Faraday efficiency and current density because of severe competitive hydrogen and ammonia evolution reactions. Here, porous carbon&#8208;supported ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles are designed to achieve 85.5% FE at a partial current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for cyclohexanone oxime with a 3% NO concentration, outperforming pure Ag nanoparticles. Mechanistic studies reveal that porous carbon can optimize the NO transport path and H2O molecule distribution on the catalyst surface, accelerating the reaction dynamics for cyclohexanone oxime electrosynthesis and suppressing ammonia and hydrogen formation. This work paves the way for accessing low&#8208;concentration gaseous reactants for various catalytic reactions.

We propose the novel concept of the application of donor&#8211;acceptor porous aromatic framework (named as PAF&#8208;310) constructed from two types (n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type) storage blocks to accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics in potassium ion batteries, which shows the impressively electrochemical properties at room and low&#8208;temperature (even &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C) with the anions and cations co&#8208;storage mechanism.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature rechargeable batteries are essential for cryogenic energy storage. However, lowering the working temperature will exacerbate the disadvantages of slowed reaction kinetics and mechanical instability of inorganic electrode materials, thus causing severe capacity degradation. In this work, for the first time, we demonstrated that constructing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;310) using p&#8208;type phenazine (PZ) and n&#8208;type hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) as storage blocks can accelerate charge transport and thus facilitate the reaction kinetics even at low&#8208;temperature conditions. When employed as the cathode of potassium ion batteries (PIBs), PAF&#8208;310 possesses higher electrochemical performance than its counterparts, including impressive discharge specific capacity (215.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate performance (77.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 A g&#8722;1) at 25&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, PAF&#8208;310 also delivers impressive specific capacities in low&#8208;temperature conditions (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 130.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C at 0.2 A g&#8722;1). Even at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, PAF&#8208;310 still exhibits good specific capacity (102.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1). Moreover, various in/ex&#8208;situ spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations were employed to elucidate the continuous co&#8208;storage mechanism of K+ and PF6&#8722; in PAF&#8208;310. This contribution sheds a feasible molecular design strategy towards low&#8208;temperature stabilized PIBs.

         <title>Structural Differentiation of Homologous Anisodimensional Frameworks Driven by Site&#8208;Selective Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time a site&#8208;selective polymerization strategy enabling the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from identical building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. The modulator plays a dual regulatory role by enhancing the reaction reversibility and regulating the conformational flexibility of monomers, leading to the formation of 2D and 3D COFs with distinct photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Theoretically, distinguished from the dimensional isomers in reticular chemistry, structures with different dimensions can also be formed by site&#8208;selective polymerization using identical building blocks bearing a high density of reactive sites. Unfortunately, the spatial confinement imposes significant challenges for molecular building blocks to achieve dimensional differentiation via their intrinsic site&#8208;selective reactivity. In this work, we first report the dimensional differentiation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) driven by site&#8208;selective polymerization of identical molecular building blocks with a high density of reactive sites. This unique phenomenon was demonstrated for the first time to originate from the role of aniline in enhancing the reversibility of the reaction system and modulating the conformational flexibility of the monomers. We systematically elucidated the mechanism underlying this dimensional differentiation and successfully demonstrated the generality of the synthetic strategy. Moreover, the residual benzaldehyde in the frameworks generated via the site&#8208;selective polymerization of the building blocks can serve as exciton acceptors, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work not only offers a novel strategy for regulating the dimensionality of COFs but also provides a valuable reference for precisely controlling the conformational flexibility of building blocks to enable topological transformations.

         <title>Stepwise Acetylene Insertion and Ammonia Activation at a Digallene and Diindene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise insertion of acetylene into the E&#9552;E bonds of digallenes and diindenes is reported. This leads to the selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores. The six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues are Lewis&#8208;acidic and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia, which&#8212;upon heating&#8212;undergo ammonolysis releasing ethylene.








Abstract
Sequential [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions between acetylene and the digallene and diindene compounds (ETer)2 (E&#160;=&#160;Ga, In; Ter&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Dipp2&#8208;C6H3; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) are described. Careful control of the reaction conditions leads to selective formation of four&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings with 2&#960; E2C2 and 4&#960; E2C4 cores, respectively. A structural analysis of the heterocycles by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests limited electronic delocalization within the rings, which is borne out in their reactivity. For example, the six&#8208;membered cyclohexadiene analogues exhibit Lewis&#8208;acidic behavior and can form stable, isolable adducts with ammonia. Upon heating, these adducts transform into the corresponding bimetallic triel amides with concomitant generation of ethene.

         <title>Chirality Unbound in Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a method to wind chiral graphene nanoribbons into either right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices, depending on the functional groups that adorn their edges. These helically wound graphene nanoribbons act as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to their chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.








Abstract
In this manuscript, we report the first demonstration of controlled helicity in extended graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We present a wealth of new graphene nanoribbons that are a direct consequence of the high&#8208;yielding and robust synthetic method revealed in this study. We created a series of defect&#8208;free, ultralong, chiral cove&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons where helical twisting of the graphene nanoribbon backbone is tuned through functionalization with chiral side chains. S&#8208;configured point chiral centers in the side chains transfer their chiral information to induce a helically chiral, right&#8208;handed twist in the graphene nanoribbon. As the backbone is extended, these helically twisted graphene nanoribbons exhibit a substantial increase in their circular dichroic response. The longest variant synthesized consists of an average of 268 linearly fused rings, reaching 65&#160;nm in average length with nearly 10 full end&#8208;to&#8208;end helical rotations. The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&#949;| value of 6780 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room&#8208;temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.

The structure exhibits an extraordinary |&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#949;&lt;/i&gt;| value of 6780 M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 550&#160;nm&#8212;the highest recorded for an organic molecule in the visible wavelength range. This new chiroptic material acts as room-temperature spin filters in thin films due to its chirality-induced spin selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Structures and Properties of Overcrowded&#8208;Ethylene Decorated (Diaza)Phosphinines via Tunable Main&#8208;Group Element Hyperconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) with P element presented a new type of P&#8208;functionalized OCEs exhibiting the unprecedent P&#8208;hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated conformations and physical properties. The unique hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability further enabled the design of a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell P&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid, which was controlled by the P&#8208;hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;isomer and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;isomer.








Abstract
Creating more sophisticated molecular systems that are responsive, dynamic, and controllable through a combination of chemical structure modification and external stimuli represents a pivotal challenge in the development of functional molecular machines. Herein, we report a new series of overcrowded&#8208;ethylene (OCE) decorated (diaza)phosphinines. Combining with the main&#8208;group element and nonplanar OCE structures, new P&#8208;molecules showed the tunable folded(F)/twisted(T)&#8208;conformations and physical properties via the distinct P&#8208;hyperconjugation of the P&#9472;C and P&#9472;N bonds. Such hyperconjugation&#8208;induced tunability is different from the classical OCEs where p&#8208;&#960;/&#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation effects are the dominating factors controlling the structures and properties. Furthermore, bromination of NP&#8208;oxide derivative induced an unexpected chemochromic T&#8594;F isomerization, highlighting the dynamic conformation character. Leveraging on the different structures, CP and NP derivatives further enabled the formations of radical cations and anions having different spin characters on the P&#8208;centers. As the new example of P&#8208;Thiele's hydrocarbon family, combining the NP structure with the overcrowded anthraquinodimethane structure yielded a light&#8208;responsive open&#8208;shell NP&#8208;anthraquinodimethane diradicaloid with a triplet ground state, which was influenced by the PN hyperconjugation effect in F&#8208;conformation and the aromaticity gain in T&#8208;conformation. Overall, our new strategy, namely the hyperconjugation&#8208;regulated tunability, paves the way toward complex organic materials with tunable the structures and physical properties.

         <title>Integrated Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the mRNA Vaccine Building Block N1&#8208;Methylpseudouridine Triphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are crucial components in mRNA vaccine technology. Here, an atom&#8208;economic, high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route for &#936;TP synthesis is presented. A new chemoenzymatic route for m1&#936;TP synthesis was developed. The method offers enhanced reaction efficiency and sustainability compared to pure chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Pseudouridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (&#936;TP) and its N1&#8208;methylated derivative (m1&#936;TP) are critical monomer building blocks of mRNA therapeutics, yet efficient, scalable methods of their synthesis from readily accessible substrates remain underdeveloped. m1&#936;TP is a major cost factor of production of the current COVID&#8208;19 vaccines. We herein report a notably atom&#8208;economic and high&#8208;yielding biocatalytic route toward &#936;TP and present two chemoenzymatic routes for producing m1&#936;TP at &#8764;200&#160;mg scale of isolated compound. Biocatalytic cascade rearrangement of uridine delivered &#936;MP or &#936; in high yields. Acetonide&#8208;protected &#936;MP was selectively N1&#8208;methylated using dimethyl sulfate and subsequently converted to the triphosphate through efficient kinase cascade reaction. Saccharomyces cerevisiae uridine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate kinase was shown for ATP&#8208;dependent phosphorylation of m1&#936;MP to m1&#936;DP and m1&#936;TP synthesis was catalyzed by Escherichia coli acetate kinase which also served to regenerate ATP by acetyl phosphate. Benchmarked against chemical route converting the enzymatically produced &#936; into m1&#936;TP, the novel chemoenzymatic route from &#936;MP offered improved metrics of reaction efficiency and sustainability. The synthetic &#936;TP and m1&#936;TP replaced UTP for mRNA synthesis by in vitro transcription. Overall, this study shows the productive integration of chemical methylation with enzymatic cascade reactions for C&#9472;C coupling and phosphorylation toward an efficient preparation of m1&#936;TP.

         <title>Origin of Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures in Siloxane Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane electrolytes exhibit anion&#8208;rich solvation structures due to their large steric hindrance. The lower Pauli repulsion of Si&#9472;O bond compared to C&#9472;O bond leads to higher intrinsic stability than corresponding ethers.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. Siloxane electrolytes exhibit excellent performance in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Herein, the mechanisms responsible for the Li metal compatibility and high&#8208;voltage resistance of siloxane electrolytes were probed by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental characterizations. Siloxane electrolytes have been demonstrated to deliver anion&#8208;rich solvation structures, which are induced by weak Li ion (Li+)&#8211;solvent interactions and strong Li+&#8211;anion interactions. The silicon (Si)&#9472;oxygen (O) bond energy of siloxane is larger than that of carbon (C)&#9472;O of C&#8208;siloxane (replacing Si atoms in siloxane with C atoms) because the atomic radius of Si is larger than that of C, and the Pauli exclusion of Si is smaller than that of C. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that the decomposition of siloxane produces substances containing Si&#9472;O fragments on Li metal surfaces, which is beneficial for interfacial stability. This work reveals the mechanism of interfacial stability and intrinsic stability of siloxane electrolytes, providing a theoretical basis for the practical application of siloxane electrolytes in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adapting Lattice Respiration Enabled by Crystal Design and d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Toward Highly Stable Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the dual considerations of crystal structure and electronic structure, we construct cathodes with &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration (SALR)&#8221; effect. The effect effectively addresses the poor cycle stability of transition metal&#8208;based RABs cathodes caused by the strong electrostatic interaction between high charge density Al3+ and host lattice. 








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the appealing three&#8208;electron transfer feature, low cost, and high safety. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice induces severe lattice distortion and structural collapse, leading to poor cycle stability in RABs. Herein, we develop a new&#8208;type FeWO4 cathode with a comprehensive consideration of the crystal structure and electronic structure. The 3D open framework and strong W&#9472;O covalent network of the FeWO4 greatly improve the storage of high charge density Al3+. Moreover, the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the transition metal and oxygen facilitates electron delocalization, which effectively weakens the interaction with the trivalent cation (Al3+). Importantly, combining in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that as&#8208;prepared cathode exhibits a &#8220;self&#8208;adapting lattice respiration&#8221; (SALR) effect. Specifically, the reversible W&#8211;O bond elongation/compression (&#916;d&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.05&#160;&#197;) during cycling reduces lattice strain and confines volume expansion to less than 3%. As results, the FeWO4 cathode delivers a high capacity of 192&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and long cycle life of over 2300 cycles with quiet low capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle in RABs.

         <title>Mechanoactivated Celite as a Catalyst for C&#8210;H Bond Perfluoroalkylation and Other Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenic materials naturally containing trace metals such as Celite or diatomaceous earth promote practical perfluoroalkylation of C&#9472;H bonds of (hetero)arenes and a double bond bromination with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide upon mechanoactivation via ball milling. This conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids beyond piezoelectric materials. This approach poses an advancement towards sustainable processes, as it demonstrates the new application of non&#8208;toxic, untreated biominerals.








Abstract
Herein, we report that Celite (diatomaceous earth) commonly viewed as an innocent filter aid or support material, or Earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;toxic metal oxides are efficient mechanoactivated catalysts for arene and heteroarene C&#9472;H bond radical trifluoromethylation and pentafluoroethylation, with the activity comparable with previously reported mechanochemical methods utilizing piezoelectric materials. Celite was also applied for mechanochemical dibromination of a double bond with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide, eliminating the need to use of lithium titanate as a piezoelectric mechanoredox catalyst. Mechanoactivation via ball milling in the presence of minimal amount of solvent was crucial to observe the reactivity, while sonication or using a pre&#8208;ground suspension in a bulk solvent were not efficient. The EDX studies and comparison with individual metal oxides suggest a possible role of trace metal oxides in mechanoinduced reactivity. Celite could be recycled and reused several times without significant loss of activity. This approach offers environmentally benign, biocompatible and inexpensive nature&#8208;inspired materials as efficient mechanocatalyts and conceptually broadens the scope of mechanoactivated solids to the materials previously deemed inert.

         <title>Regioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization by the Combination of Enzymatic and Chemocatalytic Reactions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H3CP contributes to sustainable synthesis by integrating regioselective enzymatic halogenation, Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck coupling, and enzymatic hydrolysis. TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M micelles enable the Pd&#8208;catalyzed step, allowing seamless compatibility with enzymatic reactions in one vessel under aqueous conditions. Using this platform, diverse simple aromatic substrates are readily transformed into valuable acrylic acid building blocks.








Abstract
The combination of bio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalytic processes has tremendous potential for the sustainable production of important synthetic building blocks. Such approaches capitalize on the often&#8208;high selectivity of enzymes and the broad arsenal of synthetic transformations to access highly functionalized molecules from simple precursors. However, the strict requirement of enzymes for an aqueous reaction environment, often combined with their lack of stability under harsh reaction conditions, makes the development of efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions challenging. Within this work, we developed a chemo&#8208;enzymatic platform that combines regioselective enzymatic Halogenation, chemo&#8208;catalytic Heck coupling, and an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Hydrolysis reaction (H3 Catalytic Platform&#160;=&#160;H3CP) in a single reaction vessel. H3CP uses water as a reaction solvent to facilitate the enzymatic transformations, with the cross&#8208;coupling reaction taking place in dynamic and protective super&#8208;molecular reaction vessels composed of the commercially available TPGS&#8208;705&#8208;M. Our work utilizes various halogenating enzymes (FDHs and VHPOs), selectively functionalizing diverse substrates, thus enabling subsequent metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. H3CP gives access to a broad range of valuable acrylic acid building blocks with diverse functionalization at the aromatic portion.

         <title>Engineering Neural Stem Cells with Micropatches for Improved Therapy of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) holds promise for repairing traumatic brain injury (TBI) but their therapeutic performance is hindered due to the low efficient differentiation into neurons. Direct injection of differentiation modulators to the lesion site has limited improvement to neuronal differentiation as they tend to diffuse or be degraded. In the present study, we report a simple and versatile strategy to engineer the NSCs with a micropatch to improve their therapeutic performance in TBI treatment. The micropatches are fabricated through microcontact printing technique and can adhere to the membrane with negligible detachment or internalization within 14 days after surface moficiation. The micropatches on the cell membrane can move together with stem cells and sustainedly release retinoic acid, a neuronal differentiation modulator, to regulate the surrounding microenvironment of NSCs, improving their neuronal differentiation rate from 28.0% to 54.2%. The micropatches&#8208;engineered NSCs can be implanted to the injured brain tissue through a minimally invasive microinjection approach and show outperformance in repairing damaged neural tissue of TBI mice compared to normal stem cells. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway to engineer stem cells and holds great potential in nerve regeneration and neurodegenerative diseases treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Encodable Tetrazine Chemistry for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Bioorthogonal Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using genetic code expansion (GCE) to encode bioorthogonal chemistry has emerged as a promising method for protein labeling, both in vitro and within cells. Here, we demonstrate that tetrazine (Tet) amino acids incorporated into proteins are highly tunable and have extraordinary potential for fast and quantitative bioorthogonal ligations. We describe the synthesis and characterization of reaction rates for 29 Tet amino acids (20 of which are new) and compare their encoding ability into proteins using evolved tRNA/RS pairs. For these systems, we characterized on&#8208;protein Tet stability, reaction rates, and ligation extents, as the utility of a bioorthogonal labeling group depends on its stability and reactivity when encoded into proteins. By integrating data on encoding efficiency, selectivity, on&#8208;protein stability, and in&#8208;cell labeling for Tet tRNA/RS pairs, we developed the smallest, fastest, and most stable Tet to date. This was achieved by introducing fluorine substituents to Tet4, resulting in reaction rates at the 10&#8310; M&#8315;&#185;s&#8315;&#185; level while minimizing degradation. This study expands the toolbox of bioorthogonal reagents for Tet&#8208;sTCO&#8208;based, site&#8208;specific protein labeling and demonstrates that the Tet is a uniquely tunable, highly reactive, and encodable bioorthogonal functional group. These findings provide a foundation to further explore Tet encoding and reactivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transporting layer made by self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs)&#160;are emerging as promising hole transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells, owing to their reduced parasitic absorption and effective carrier extraction. However, perovskite films grown on HTMs substrates typically exhibit a high defect density, which adversely affects device performance. In this study, we investigated the film growth kinetics of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite on monolayer materials substrates and uncovered a halide phase segregation in initial nucleation stage during crystal growth kinetics at the interface, which brings small grain sizes and significant lattice strain within the perovskite film.&#160;To address this issue, we introduced a biphosphate&#8208;substituted molecule on the HTMs surface to coordinate with PbBr2 that suppresses halide phase segregation, leading to improved crystallographic orientation and a reduction in defect density. As a result, the wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77 eV) perovskite solar cells achieved a power conversion efficiency of 19.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.35 V, while tandem devices reached an impressive efficiency of 28.65%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nondestructive Patterning of Upconverting and Down&#8208;Shifting Luminescent Nanoparticles for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro&#8208; and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid&#8208;state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three&#8208;armed diazo crosslinker (3G) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18 mJ/cm2, in stark contrast to 200&#8722;500 mJ/cm2 for diazirine&#8208;based crosslinkers) required for crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G, and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G&#8208;based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi&#8208;layer structures for dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system&#8208;level devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Robust Nickel&#8208;Interlocked &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Catalyst for Photocatalytic Aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (  Ni@COF1  ) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (  Ni@COF1R  ),  Ni@COF1  exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late&#8208;stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin&#8208;linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increased encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) compared to TRAP and demonstrates improved uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is injected into mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and fit to a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model. NIR&#8208;TMPA demonstrates prolonged short&#8208;phase half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control with similar slow&#8208;phase half&#8208;life, leading to an increased area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve clearance and pointing to its sequestration in the tumor site. Endpoint fluorescence analysis of mouse organs ex vivo also supports this conclusion. TMPA and its future derivatives therefore bear potential for targeted treatment of GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Nitride&#8208;chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High Performance All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial for advancing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free nature, which facilitates intimate solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact and uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen&#8208;chlorine dual&#8208;anion framework, formulated as Li3x+0.1ZrNxCl4.1, for high&#8208;voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li2ZrCl6 with a triclinic structure, increased N3&#8722; substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li+ conductivity from 0.46 mS cm&#8722;1 to 3.01 mS cm&#8722;1, alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8 V. This dual&#8208;anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high&#8208;energy LiNi0.83Co0.06Mn0.11O2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.5 V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long&#8208;term cycling stability exceeding 3,000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li1.3ZrN0.4Cl4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50 &#8239;&#176;C) and higher cut&#8208;off voltages (up to 4.8 V). These results highlight the promise of dual&#8208;anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next&#8208;generation SSEs beyond traditional single&#8208;anion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Blocking Strategy Boosts H2S Tolerance in Platinum&#8208;Based Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) show great potential for energy conversion, but their platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts are easily and irreversibly poisoned by trace impurities like H2S, causing performance degradation with unclear mechanisms. Here, combining in situ Raman spectroscopy with theoretical calculations, we found that on pure Pt surfaces, H2S dissociate into S* and HS* intermediates that occupy active sites of continuous Pt atoms in an acidic solution under 50 ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere. However, on PtRu alloy surfaces, while *OH species were observed on Ru sites, no sulfur&#8208;containing species were detected on Pt sites. Comparative experiments revealed that the sulfur&#8208;related Raman peaks of PtRu exhibited a redshift compared to Pt, indicating that Ru alloying weakens the *S adsorption on Pt sites through electronic effects. These results demonstrate that Ru not only creates discontinuous Pt sites to block sulfur adsorption but also significantly weakens sulfur binding through electronic modulation. Based on these insights, small&#8208;sized site&#8208;blocking PtRu/C catalysts&#160;were developed, exhibiting only 9.2% activity decay after 700 s in 50 ppm H2S/H2 atmosphere, a 4.3&#8208;fold improvement over commercial Pt/C catalysts (39.3% decay). This work provides fundamental understanding of H2S poisoning mechanisms and practical guidelines for designing robust, poison&#8208;resistant&#160;catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Chemical Presodiation under Air Condition for Highly Stable Na&#8208;deficient Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered transition&#8208;metal oxides have attracted growing attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), however, their application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to Na&#8208;deficiency and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. Herein, a universal chemical presodiation pathway is reported with Na&#8208;bipyridine dissolved in diethyl ether (Na&#8208;Bpy/DEE) for stable Na&#8208;deficient P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) electrode under air condition. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;functional groups of Bpy&#8226;&#8208; radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na+ from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF&#8208;rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g&#8208;1, and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles. This work proposes an industrially feasible presodiation strategy to highly efficient SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Homobimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Cobalt Catalyst for the Methanolysis of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (1) has shown excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, surpassing the related bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)(PMe2Ph)(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (2), the Co(II) complex [Co(Cl)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)] (3), and the Co(I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)]Cl (4). A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#8211;H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PNHP ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si&#8211;H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(&#8211;I) centers. Then, the PhSiH2 group at the Co(&#8211;I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ cation, regenerating the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; species. [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH&#8208;assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Polymerization of n&#8208;Doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)  Using Parts Per Million (ppm) Level of Molybdenum Trioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution&#8208;processable, n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n&#8208;PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone&#8208;mediated or copper&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO&#8322;&#8208;catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO&#8323;)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of n&#8208;PBDF. Remarkably, MoO&#8323; at parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) concentrations achieves near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion (&gt;99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain&#8208;growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO&#8323; mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This breakthrough not only provides a scalable, low&#8208;cost route to high&#8208;quality n&#8208;PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction as a Mechanistic Probe for Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to alter reaction kinetics. Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed&#8208;width cavities and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C=C bond. In all cases, no changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Lewis Basicity in Oxide Lattice Oxygens: A Regulating Force for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) require fast oxygen conversion kinetics to achieve good cycling performance and high energy efficiency. In the text of catalysts for LOBs, Lewis basicity of lattice oxygens (OL) in common transition metal oxides is often underestimated due to the weak electron donor characteristic of OL. In this work, a new spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxide with Lewis basicity (LB&#8208;HEO) was synthesized through a Joule&#8208;heating method. OL was activated by regulating the tetrahedral site&#8208;OL&#8208;octahedral site (MTd&#8208;OL&#8208;MOh) units in the spinel&#8208;type HEO, enhancing the Lewis basicity. Used as cathode catalyst for LOBs, LB&#8208;HEO could attract Li+ and increase the disorder in discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), promoting the delithiation process and the interfacial charge transfer at the LB&#8208;HEO|Li2O2 interface. The activation energy of interfacial charge transfer was significantly reduced from 63.5 kJ mol&#8208;1 to 22.4 kJ mol&#8208;1. As a result, low charging overpotential of 0.97 V and long cycling lifespan of 135 cycles at 100 mA g&#8208;1 were achieved with capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g&#8208;1. The strategy based on the regulation of Li+ behavior through its interaction with Lewis bases provides a promising prospective for the design of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance LOBs.</dc:description>

OL was activated by regulating the tetrahedral site-OL-octahedral site (MTd-OL-MOh) units in the spinel-type HEO, enhancing the Lewis basicity. Used as cathode catalyst for LOBs, LB-HEO could attract Li+ and increase the disorder in discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), promoting the delithiation process and the interfacial charge transfer at the LB-HEO|Li2O2 interface. The activation energy of interfacial charge transfer was significantly reduced from 63.5 kJ mol-1 to 22.4 kJ mol-1. As a result, low charging overpotential of 0.97 V and long cycling lifespan of 135 cycles at 100 mA g-1 were achieved with capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g-1. The strategy based on the regulation of Li+ behavior through its interaction with Lewis bases provides a promising prospective for the design of non-noble metal catalysts for high-performance LOBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanically Tunable Slide&#8208;ring Polymers via Photo&#8208;regulated Topological Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;synthetic dynamic control of polymer topology to modulate material properties on demand remains a grand challenge in polymer science. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive slide&#8208;ring polymer network whose mechanical properties can be reversibly tuned through photoisomerization of incorporated azobenzene units. In the trans&#8208;state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material. UV&#8208;induced switching to the sterically demanding cis&#8208;configuration restricts ring mobility, thereby increasing the Young's modulus by two&#8208;fold while reducing toughness. Control experiments with non&#8208;interlocked analogs revealed the opposite mechanical response&#8212;light&#8208;induced softening&#8212;highlighting the pivotal role of topology in property regulation. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions. This work establishes a versatile strategy for post&#8208;synthetic topological control via molecular photoswitches, enabling the design of adaptive polymers with stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanical properties for applications in smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co,Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co,Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6+2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2+6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Response&#160;and Self&#8208;Powered CPL Detection in Unique&#160;Triangular&#8208;Tetrahedral Chiral Copper(I)&#160;Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;coordination polyhedral architecture of Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides induces significant structural distortions,   endowing these materials with remarkable circularly polarized light (CPL) activity and exceptional nonlinear optical (NLO) performance. However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors (glum) in Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared one&#8208;dimensional chiral (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 (where MPZ is 2&#8208;methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular&#8208;tetrahedral configuration in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric cubic P1211 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH2PO4. Additionally, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and gTHG&#8208;CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG&#8208;based CPL detection in Cu(&#8544;)&#8208;based metal halides. The self&#8208;powered CPL photodetectors based on (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0 V, and further achieve self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection with excellent low&#8208;dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship in chiral organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next&#8208;generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mathematical Double&#8208;Matrix Switchable Homochiral Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homochiral ferroelectrics have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their distinctive chiroptical effects in contrast to ordinary ferroelectrics. Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between non&#8208;zero and zero values in both second&#8208;order&#160;nonlinear optical susceptibility &#967;(2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second&#8208;harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 (BTA = 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432F2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362 K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between non&#8208;zero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both &#967;(2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG&#8208;CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432F2 phase transition enables (R&#8208;/S&#8208;BTA)2CdBr4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG&#8208;CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase. Our findings shed light on the exploration of mathematical double&#8208;matrix switchable chiral ferroelectrics with SHG&#8208;CD and piezoelectric response switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Coordination&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a promising strategy for producing high&#8208;value chemical and fuel. However, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction remain a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate intermediates by the construction of halogen&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic cages (Ni8L12X4, X = Cl, Br, I). Theory calculations show that the formation of the *COOH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 and promote the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni8L12I4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl&#8208;coordinated and Br&#8208;coordinated Ni MOC by 200 and 5&#8208;fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 and promote the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni8L12I4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 &#956;mol g-1 h-1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl-coordinated and Br-coordinated Ni MOC by 200 and 5-fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Electric Field Microenvironment&#8208;Induced Dynamic Spatial&#160;Confinement to Stabilize I+ towards High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading and Stable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four&#8208;electron iodine conversion chemistry (I&#8208;/I2/I+) endows zinc&#8208;iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high&#8208;voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8208;) on the cathode by &#8208;C&#8208;N+&#8208;induced localized electric field microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl&#8208; concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low&#8208;concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl&#8208; maintains a balance with iodine species at the &#8208;C&#8208;N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03 mg cm&#8208;2, the PDDA&#8208;I still maintains a distinct four&#8208;electron&#8208;conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm&#8208;2. An impressing lifespan of 10000 cycles is achieved at 12.6 mg cm&#8208;2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycles, exceeding conventional iodine cathode by 20&#8208;fold. This work provides an important reference for high&#8208;performance four&#8208;electron conversion zinc&#8208;iodine batteries at high iodine loading.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four-electron iodine conversion chemistry (I-/I2/I+) endows zinc-iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl-, Br-). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high-voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl-) on the cathode by -C-N+-induced localized electric field microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA-I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl- concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low-concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl- maintains a balance with iodine species at the -C-N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03 mg cm-2, the PDDA-I still maintains a distinct four-electron-conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm-2. An impressing lifespan of 10000 cycles is achieved at 12.6 mg cm-2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycles, exceeding conventional iodine cathode by 20-fold. This work provides an important reference for high-performance four-electron conversion zinc-iodine batteries at high iodine loading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Electronically Polarized Fe&#8208;N5 Catalysts Redirect Polymerization&#8208;Driven Phenolic Pollutant Removal Toward Sustainable Carbon Sequestration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sustainable strategy for simultaneous pollutant removal and carbon sequestration is offered by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;mediated electron transfer mechanism. However, it remains challenging to achieve catalysts with durable and high activity. A novel catalyst design strategy leveraging boron doping&#8208;induced long&#8208;range electronic polarization to precisely modulate PMS complexation dynamics on single&#8208;atom catalysts is proposed in this study. It is demonstrated that B&#8208;doping induces asymmetric Fe&#8208;N5 coordination at the atomic iron centers while creating electron&#8208;enriched carbon auxiliary sites. The electron distribution is synergistically optimized by this dual&#8208;site configuration through lowering the d&#8208;band center and establishing a polarized charge transfer pathway. Complexes with enhanced oxidation potential are generated by the engineered FeSA&#8208;BNC/PMS, redirecting bisphenol A degradation from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization to an interfacial polymerization pathway via outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer. Remarkably, &gt;3 times the magnitude of higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal activity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts and 4 orders of magnitude higher reactivity than conventional carbon nitride catalyst are exhibited by the optimized catalyst. Excellent operational stability (&gt;1700 h continuous operation) with &gt;120 L actual wastewater treatment capacity is demonstrated by practical implementation in a continuous&#8208;flow microreactor. This work advances electronic modulation strategies for sustainable water purification technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Proteomics Identifies RBBP7 as a New E3 Ligase Supporting Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has been recognized as a powerful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small&#8208;molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein&#8208;targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR&#8208;ABL, BRD4, EGFRL858R, and EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S. Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the &#8220;pan&#8208;kinase&#8221; inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK&#8208;3&#946;, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide&#8208;containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), an important optical property of noble metal nanomaterials, is extensively applied in electrochemistry. However, the specific LSPR effects on metallic nanoparticles are difficult to unravel and evaluate owing to simultaneous factors like intrinsic electroactivity and surface interactions. Herein, we designed a series of shell&#8208;isolated nanostructures, with mesoporous silica shells and plasmonic Au Nanorod cores (AuNR@mSiO2), for precisely investigating both LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging was employed to monitor the in situ turnover frequency (TOF) of photon emissions on individual plasmonic nano&#8208;amplifiers to determine the dominant factors influencing LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. TOF heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images unveiled distinct hot spot distributions along the plasmonic nanostructures. Our approach provides insight into and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects during electrochemical reactions, thereby facilitating precise electrocatalyst design based on the physiochemical properties of LSPR.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the correlation of loading&#8208;to&#8208;performance of single atom catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between mental loading and overall catalytic performance remains elusive for single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs), which hinders the oriented optimization of active site densities and scalable synthesis of them. To effectively address this issue, Ru single atoms with different loading are anchored on the graphene&#8208;like framework&#160;and tungsten carbide substrate (WC1&#8208;x) to investigate the synergistic effect among different local configurations. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the loading of Ru atoms critically governs the interatomic distance between adjacent metal active sites at second shell coordination. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy shows that WC1&#8208;x nanoparticles can break the hydrogen bond network by reorienting H2O molecule adsorption and promoting the availability of active H2O among electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the moderate distance between active sites could further lower the reaction barrier and enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, the optimal sample Ru&#8208;WC1&#8208;x with 0.76 wt% Ru loading exhibits a low overpotential of 7 mV at 10 mA&#215;cm&#8722;2 and the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer to stably operate for 100 h at 1 A&#215;cm&#8722;2. Such correlation of spatial effects between different active sites were universally demonstrated in similar systems anchored with either Pt, Ir or Co elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Nuclear quantum confinement enables robust deuterium bonds for highly reversible aluminum anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fundamentally limits aluminum electroreduction in aqueous electrolytes by dominating interfacial charge transfer. Here, we suppress HER by engineering deuterium bonds (D&#8208;bonds) through nuclear quantum effects, confining D between D&#8322;O and DMF molecules. This quantum confinement weakens hydrogen delocalization and restructures the Al3+ solvation sheath, reducing water activity kinetically and thermodynamically. The regulated electrolyte enables uniform aluminum nucleation and dense plating layers, achieving 569 h (0.05 mA cm&#8208;2) and 379 h (0.1 mA cm&#8208;2) cycling stability in the 2D2O/1DMF electrolyte, which outperforms traditional sulfate electrolytes by 3.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. Our work uniquely leverages nuclear quantum confinement to engineer robust D&#8208;bonds, simultaneously suppressing HER and enabling atomic&#8208;level control over aluminum solvation structures for unprecedented Al redox reversibility in sulfate electrolytes. This exemplification pushes the electrolyte engineering from extensive component adjustment to quantum precision engineering, which provides an innovative solution for the high&#8208;activity water&#8208;based battery system.</dc:description>

The regulated electrolyte enables uniform aluminum nucleation and dense plating layers, achieving 569 h (0.05 mA cm-2) and 379 h (0.1 mA cm-2) cycling stability in the 2D2O/1DMF electrolyte, which outperforms traditional sulfate electrolytes by 3.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. Our work uniquely leverages nuclear quantum confinement to engineer robust D-bonds, simultaneously suppressing HER and enabling atomic-level control over aluminum solvation structures for unprecedented Al redox reversibility in sulfate electrolytes. This exemplification pushes the electrolyte engineering from extensive component adjustment to quantum precision engineering, which provides an innovative solution for the high-activity water-based battery system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Layered Heterostructure Enables Reversible Oxygen Redox in Lithium Manganese Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), primarily due to their exceptional capacity originating from oxygen redox chemistry. While Li2MnO3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox&#8208;active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural&#8208;engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel&#8208;layered heterostructures (designated as LMO&#8208;SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O2&#8208;) and molecular oxygen (O2) &#8208; the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese&#8208;based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li+ diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO&#8208;based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high&#8208;capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Reactivity of Thioimidates for Diversified Polymeric Amidines with Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first reactions of thioimidates under radical&#8208;mediated conditions are described along with the delineation of structural factors that impact radical reactivity and possible side reactions. Thioimidate&#8208;containing copolymers with methylmethacrylate (MMA) are synthesized through radical mediated, chain&#8208;growth polymerization. These materials serve as a synthetic branch point for facile conversion into amidines by treatment with a weak&#8208;acid and an external amine. Our approach allows for more diverse amidine structure than have been previously reported in polymers. This chemistry also enables crosslinking to form novel hydrogels with finely tuned acid&#8208;base behavior. Subsequent examination of the acid&#8208;base properties revealed that these features are preserved across linear, soluble amidine polymers to crosslinked amidine gel polymer architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing Fluorosulfonyl Pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO2&#8211;OSF5) Reservoir Capacity: Selective SOF4, SO2F2 and [OSF5]&#8211; Anion Release.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the investigation of inorganic reagents containing the pentafluorooxosulfate (OSF5) moiety is presented. First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#8208;N=S(O)F2) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Regulation of Perovskite Growth and Energetics via Oligoether Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembling Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling molecules (SAMs) are widely used as interfacial layers to optimize the surface properties of nickel oxides (NiOx) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, less attention is paid to the effect of SAMs on the regulation of perovskite growth and energetics. Here, based on the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular backbone, oligoether chain is introduced with different chain length to endow two novel SAMs namely EPA and MEPA with good capability of bottom&#8208;up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiOx with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain&#8208;containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization and importantly well&#8208;matched energy level alignment at the top surface especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiOx/MEPA based PSCs along with good device stability which can maintain 90% of initial efficiency under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions over 1260 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Excited State Proton Transfer in Thin Films Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular structure, solvent/matrix, the surrounding environment, and molecular vibrations can influence the excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Theoretical studies predict that light&#8208;matter strong coupling can also modify the energy barrier for proton transfer reactions. Here, we experimentally explore the role of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on the ESPT using the weak photoacid, 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthalenesulfonate (N8S) as the probe. The ESPT in N8S can occur through a solvent/matrix bridge connecting the proton&#8208;donating and accepting units. To check the role of VSC, we embedded N8S in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix and strongly coupled the &#8208;OH stretching vibrational modes of PVA. The steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission analysis reveal that the quantum yield of RO&#8208; emission and the ESPT rate constant improve by a factor of two under VSC, compared to the non&#8208;cavity, half&#8208;cavity, and off&#8208;resonance films. Our findings indicate that VSC can be a tool to control the proton transfer processes, opening avenues for developing physically tunable photoacid&#8208;based sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;mediated DNAzyme Chaperoning for Sensitive Trace Metal Ion Mapping on Live Neuronal Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transient release of metal ions at neuronal cell membranes holds significant implications in neurophysiology and pathology, necessitating highly sensitive methods for spatially resolved quantification in live cells. DNAzymes have emerged as powerful tools for metal ion detection due to their inherent specificity, yet their practical application is often hindered by limited stability and sensitivity. Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes, aiming at enhancing the stability and activity of DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes is shown to significantly enhance metal ion detection performance, resulting in elevated stability and a 2&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity, attributed to alterations in the local net charge induced by TDF. In vitro investigations demonstrate that the nanodevice developed here faithfully maps Cu2+ concentrations within a range of 0 &#8208; 10 &#181;M on the membrane of neuronal cells, meeting the requirements for Cu2+ sensing under both physiological and pathological conditions. This work presents an easily adaptable approach to enhance the performance of DNAzymes and lays the foundations for the development of other DNAzyme&#8208;based sensitive detection nanodevices.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM led to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Aggregation&#8208;Driven d&#8208;Band Engineering in Nickel Cocatalysts for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient CO2 activation remains a pivotal challenge in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, necessitating precise electronic modulation of catalytic centers to overcome kinetic limitations. In this work, we engineer Ni(bpy)3Br2 cocatalyst aggregates via non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly and systematically unravel the role of aggregation in governing photocatalytic performance. A synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrates that symmetry disruption within the aggregates induces localized charge redistribution. Such a charge redistribution triggers a 0.6 eV upshift in the Ni d&#8208;band center, which delivers lower Gibbs free energies for the formation of *CO2 and *COOH. The optimized aggregates achieve a record&#8208;high quantum yield of 26.84% at 450 nm with 99.3% CO selectivity, representing the highest performance reported to date for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion systems. Importantly, the d&#8208;band center of the Ni sites can be precisely modulated by varying the aggregation degree of Ni(bpy)3Br2. This work not only advances a novel d&#8208;band center modulation strategy for electronic configuration engineering but also provides in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level insights into the aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;regulated d&#8208;band center.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulate the Singlet&#8211;triplet Energy Gap by Spatially Separating HOMO and LUMO for High Performance Organic Photovoltaic Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing the single&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;EST) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules has been proposed to be able to reduce the nonradiative recombination by tuning low&#8208;lying triplet state (T1) and/or the excited state (S1), thus reducing the energy loss (Eloss) and increasing the open&#8208;circuit voltage in their devices. However, how to design the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with small &#8710;EST and high performance is challenging. Aiming to address this issue, YDF, YTF and YTF&#8208;H were synthesized. Among them, device based on YDF with partially spatially separating HOMO and LUMO exhibits a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.04%, which is one of the most efficient efficiencies for binary systems. For YTF and YTF&#8208;H, their completely spatially separated HOMO and LUMO indeed leads a much reducing of &#8710;EST caused by low&#8208;lying S1 state, together with excellent charge mobility and light absorption, required for higher performance OPV. But their low S1 state cause several non&#8208;radiative recombination due to strong S1&#8208;S0 coupling (PCE &lt;1.5%). These results indicate that future design to have high performance molecules with small &#8710;EST should avoid the sharp decrease in S1, and the ideal scenario would be to elevate the T1 state, thereby mitigating the energy gap law.</dc:description>

         <title>EDTA&#8208;Mg Nano&#8208;Chelators Amplify Ferroptosis by Artificially Simulating the Epithelial&#8208;Mesenchymal Transition Process and Endogenous Iron Deprivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in initiating tumor metastasis. Commonly, researchers focus on inhibiting EMT to prevent tumor metastasis. However, they ignore that tumor cells undergoing EMT are more vulnerable to disturbance from the external environment. Tumor cells in this period are a potential therapeutic target, yet precisely regulating the EMT of tumor cells remains a challenging problem to be solved. Here, based on metal chelation therapy, we propose a strategy of artificially mimicking EMT, integrating ferroptosis and immunotherapy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. The prepared ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid&#8208;magnesium (EDTA&#8208;Mg), on the one hand, chelates Ca2+ on the surface of tumor cells to form EDTA&#8208;Ca, causing the dissociation of tumor cells. Meanwhile, E&#8208;cadherin is downregulated, while vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP&#8208;2) are upregulated, indicating the occurrence of EMT. On the other hand, after EDTA&#8208;Ca is endocytosed by tumor cells, it deprives Fe in the lysosomes to form EDTA&#8208;Fe, which induces ferroptosis through a Fenton reaction. Ferroptosis, combined with the initially released Mg2+, synergistically amplifies the immune response, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, such a strategy of artificially simulating EMT for tumor treatment has hitherto not been reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective electrochemical production of ethylene from bicarbonate solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report an engineered material structuring to selectively produce C2+ products with high FE directly from a N2&#8208;saturated bicarbonate solution. Multiphysics modeling studies reveal the critical role of local current density distribution and the spatio&#8208;selective evolution of C2+ products, which is favored in thinner catalysts (240 &#181;m thickness). By jointly tailoring catalyst configuration and mass transport in bicarbonate electroreduction&#8212;adjusting the thickness (ranges from 1040 &#181;m to 240 &#181;m), porosity, and surface oxidation of Cu mesh catalysts, as well as catholyte composition&#8212;we achieved a maximum ethylene FE of 39% and total C2+ product FE over 55% at 150 mA/cm2 with a 240 &#181;m thickness of Cu mesh. The system is also stable for over 160 hours at 100 mA/cm2 with maintained ethylene FE over 20%. The direct (bi)carbonate electrolysis system converts bicarbonate into C2+ products with a CO2 utilization efficiency of more than 90%, thereby reducing potential expenses associated with regeneration and separation. We determine that optimizing the catalyst pore structure, which governs the diffusion of the bicarbonate solution, and the copper surface oxide layer, which determines product FE, is critical to maximizing ethylene production from bicarbonate solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional Second Harmonic Generation in Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxyfluoroniobate Crystals via Structural Fingerprint Optimization of Polar Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chain&#8208;based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors&#9472;namely, the &#8736;(O&#8722;Nb&#8722;O&#8217;) bond angle, &#967;[F, Nb, Nb&#8217;, F&#8217;] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO2F4] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating &#960;&#8208;conjugated biuret (C2H5N3O2) molecules with optimally aligned 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chains, we synthesized (H3O)(Biu)2(NbOF4) (Biu = biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH2PO4, among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (&#916;n = 0.062 @1064 nm) and wide band gap (Eg = 4.50 eV) further support its potential as a high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next&#8208;generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal&#8208;Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C=C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C=C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C=C double bonds, leading to a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects. By achieving precise capture and folding of flexible olefinic substrates, this study establishes a new paradigm for the design of artificial host molecules and a novel platform for enzyme&#8208;like reaction vessels.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur Mediated Interfacial Proton&#8208;Directed Transfer Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia over Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a sustainable strategy that simultaneously realizes the nitrogen cycle and resource integration. The key issue hindering the NORR efficiency is accelerating proton (*H) transfer to facilitate NO hydrogenation while inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate an interface&#8208;engineered sulfur&#8208;mediated Cu@Co electrocatalyst (S&#8208;Cu@Co/C) that boosts NORR performance through dual modulation of electronic structure and proton transfer on active sites. A comprehensive program of experimental and theoretical calculations was employed to discover that sulfur incorporation induces electron redistribution in the Cu&#8208;Co interface, creating electron&#8208;rich sulfur and electron&#8208;deficient metals. This electronic configuration synergistically enhances NO adsorption on Cu sites and promotes water dissociation on Co sites. More critically, sulfur could direct the rapid transfer of *H from Co to Cu sites, thereby accelerating the NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER. Consequently, S&#8208;Cu@Co/C achieves an NH3 yield rate of 655.3 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.4% in an H&#8208;cell. Remarkably, the catalyst could maintain continuous electrolysis tests and steady NH3 yield up to 100 h. This work provides innovative insights into the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts via heteroatom&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS&#8217;s ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe TL&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated the XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1,874 FDA&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with Cys342 of XPB, suppressed XPB&#8217;s ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive N2 Cleavage and Nitride Insertion Reactivity at Molybdenum Complexes Supported by a Rigid PNP Pincer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;nitride species represent key reactive intermediates in reductive N2 cleavage and functionalization. Toward a better understanding of nitride transfer reactivity, we present a series of Mo&#8208;nitride complexes supported by a rigid diphosphino&#8208;acridane pincer ligand. Notably, the stepwise reduction of a MoIVCl3 complex under N2 allows the isolation of a bridging diazenido intermediate as well as a dinuclear Mo&#8208;nitride species (4) accommodating a bridging N2 moiety. This is the first example of a Mo(IV) nitride&#8208;N2 species and extensive 15N&#8208;labelling studies were performed to characterize the bridging dinitrogen, diazenido, and nitride moieties. The structure of 4 adopts two orthogonal &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions between N2 and two structurally rigidified MoIV(N) fragments featuring a filled d&#960; orbital. Effective &#960;&#8208;backbonding from such a MoIV(N) fragment leads to the isolation of PMe3, CO, and CNtBu substituted analogues. Further reactivity of the Mo&#8208;nitride species with &#960;&#8208;acidic CO and isocyanide leads to the formation of MoII&#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;carbodiimide species, respectively. Computational studies suggest that nitride carbonylation proceeds via an associative nitride insertion pathway, encouraging further studies in direct N2 fixation to value&#8208;added products via nitride functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote and Spatiotemporal Modulation of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Croconaine Dyes via NIR Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymerization holds great promise for the fabrication of well&#8208;defined nanostructures. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control over the dynamic assembly of supramolecular polymers using external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation strategy that exploits the intrinsic photothermal properties of croconaine&#8208;based molecular building blocks to modulate the aggregation&#8211;dissociation equilibrium of seeds, thereby enabling the formation of supramolecular polymers and copolymers. Light irradiation provides enhanced tunability through adjustments in laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength. Notably, the spatial precision afforded by laser irradiation allows for localized seed dissociation, offering a new approach for spatially controlled supramolecular polymerization. This method also enables efficient light&#8208;mediated gel formation, spatially selective sol&#8211;gel transitions, and healing in supramolecular organogels. These findings demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive strategy for regulating supramolecular polymerization and open new avenues for constructing nanomaterials with programmable structures and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetone Derivatives for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation, Trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;Methylation of (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of low&#8208;cost, readily available, and broadly applicable reagents for the methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of aryl chlorides is crucial. Using acetone and its isotopic derivatives as feedstocks, we have prepared the methylating, trideuteromethylating, and 13C&#8208;methylating agents TDTP (2&#8208;(1,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine), TDTP&#8208;CD3, and TDTP&#8208;&#185;3CH3. Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine&#8208;containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional&#8208;group tolerance and scalability; they therefore hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction begins with nickel&#8208;catalyzed generation of a methyl radical, followed by radical cross&#8208;coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Amorphous Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Films for Direct X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X&#8208;ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X&#8208;ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time&#8208;intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large&#8208;area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X&#8208;ray detection. By reacting a non&#8208;crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz+) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42&#8208; anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42&#8208; anions serve as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz+ cations as charge transporters. Direct X&#8208;ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 2,165 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20 V.mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01 nGyair s&#8722;1. The amorphous nature of these films enhances their processability, allowing for fabrication in various sizes and shapes, and making them highly adaptable for scalable detector applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enabled Stable Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes via &#960;&#8208;Type Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively stabilizing oxygen redox is the most challenging task for practical applications of high energy density Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. However, how to accurately tune the oxygen energy level to achieve reversible redox remains puzzling so far. In this work, we achieve stable oxygen redox in layered Li&#8208;rich materials over the whole voltage range without irreversible O2 release by adjusting the interlayer metal cation environment adjacent to the ligand. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis of metal&#8208;ligand orbital combinations, we confirm the obvious charge transfer from O to Ni due to the &#960;&#8208;type interaction between Ni 3d spin&#8208;down t2g orbitals and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Ni coordination environment after Li extraction under the &#960;&#8208;type interaction, which enhances the intrinsic competition between anion and cation oxidation, keeping O 2p state below the metal band to avoid over&#8208;oxidation. As a result, the modified material shows improved electrochemical performance and stable structural/interface evolution. This work provides new insights into the relationship between the adjacent metal environment and the ligand O redox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Active Hydrogen Absorption and Stabilized Cu(I) Species over Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce Bridges Boosting Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of water activation center to promote active hydrogen (*H) generation and stabilize Cu(I) species are significant for the formation of multicarbon (C2+) products over Cu&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed&#8208;mediated growth method. The as&#8208;synthesized CuxO&#8208;CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic&#160;efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Ce bridges in CuxO&#8208;CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C&#8208;C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4. This work provides new insights into modulating *H absorption and stabilizing Cu(I) species for boosting CO2 to C2+ products.</dc:description>

Herein, CeO2 nanograins and CuO nanothorns were selectively deposited on the edges of Cu2O cubes through the seed-mediated growth method. The as-synthesized CuxO-CeO2 composites exhibit enhanced Faradaic&#160;efficiency and partial current density of C2H4 compared with Cu2O cubes. In situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations confirm that the Cu-O-Ce bridges in CuxO-CeO2 composite can effectively enhance *H absorption and stabilize Cu(I) species, facilitating subsequent C-C coupling and further protonation into the key *COCHO intermediate of C2H4. This work provides new insights into modulating *H absorption and stabilizing Cu(I) species for boosting CO2 to C2+ products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Janus Superiority of Membranes in Chemical Engineering and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus configurations, characterized by their inherent asymmetry, enable directional mass transfer in membrane materials that drives novel and energy&#8208;efficient chemical processes. This Janus superiority spans applications from nanoscale molecular and ionic transport to macro&#8208;scale separation systems with asymmetric spatial architectures. This review provides an analysis of the material foundations including design principles, structure regulation, and scalability challenges underlying Janus membranes. We explore the physics that govern their unique behavior and examine their diverse applications across chemical engineering, including phase transfer, and molecular or ionic transport. Through a multiscale perspective, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Janus superiority in advancing chemical engineering technologies. Finally, we discuss the hurdles in translating theoretical advances into practical applications and propose promising avenues for future research to harness the full potential of Janus membranes and systems in addressing global challenges related to energy, sustainability, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Activatable PROTAC Prodrug for Tumor Biomarker&#8208;Driven Near&#8208;Infrared Opto&#8208;Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor&#8208;homing cyclopeptide through a tandem&#8208;locking linker, which comprises a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor&#8208;selective degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem&#8208;activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off&#8208;tumor toxicity of PROTAC.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 into Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. We developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at &#8722;1.8 V vs. RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20 hours without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4 V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5 mmol L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: (i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and (ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Hydroarylation of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Outer&#8208;Sphere Electron Transfer with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydroarylation of unactivated alkenes provides a direct route to enantiomerically enriched C&#8211;C bonds in aryl&#8208;containing compounds, a key transformation in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. While recent advances have achieved high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with terminal alkenes, controlled hydroarylation of unactivated interna alkenes remains challenging. Here we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed protocol that overcomes this limitation through a mechanistic paradigm shift. By employing diaryliodonium salts as dual&#8208;function reagents, our method achieves high enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity in the hydroarylation of both internal and terminal unactivated alkenes. These salts enable a transition from concerted to stepwise oxidative addition via dissociative single&#8208;electron transfer (DSET), generating a cationic alkyl&#8208;nickel intermediate prone to fragmentation and aryl radical addition. Mechanistic studies, including a key experiment in 1,4&#8208;dioxane yielding an enantiomerically pure solvent&#8208;functionalized product, establish migratory insertion as the enantio&#8208; and regio&#8208;determining step. This approach not only expands the scope of asymmetric hydroarylation but also provides a new mechanistic framework for selective hydrofunctionalization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclic Selenenyl Sulfides with Tuned Bioreductive Step Rates Reveal Constraints for Probes Targeting Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reductive activation of dichalcogenide probes by thiol&#8208;type oxidoreductases proceeds through a cascade of consecutive, partly reversible steps. Stereocontrol elements can modulate the reaction rates of these steps to reach substrate&#8208;controlled kinetic selectivity for reductase chemotypes in live cells. We now deploy regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, template&#8208;, and pH&#8208;control elements to shape the reactivity of unprecedented bicyclic selenenyl sulfides (SeSP), arriving at probes that selectively target the mammalian selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase TrxR1. We accessed these densely functionalised cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;fused 1,2&#8208;thiaselenanes on gram scale over 5 steps by using a regioselective key step that elaborates an unusual, differentially protected 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis&#8208;aziridine intermediate through sequential one&#8208;pot chalcogen introduction and selenenyl sulfide formation. By profiling a set of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomeric bicycles for their partly or fully reversible reactivity during reductive activation, we show how effects that slow their reduction steps (addition then resolution) can compensate by vastly accelerating subsequent activation (cyclisation) speeds, such that cellular redox processing is effective and TrxR&#8208;selective. More broadly, this study shows how multistep cascade probes can leverage conformational effects and internal noncovalent interactions to differentiate step kinetics along their on&#8208;target versus off&#8208;target reaction pathways, thus achieving reaction&#8208;based target selectivity in complex biological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline&#160;2D&#160;Conjugated&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic&#160;Framework&#160;for Superior Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1). Experimental studies combined with theoretical calculations further elucidate the Na+ storage mechanism.</dc:description>

Herein, a 2D c-MOF single crystal (Cu-TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH-TBP) ligand. Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic-level crystal structure of Cu-TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer-stacking. Cu-TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox-active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu-TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1). Experimental studies combined with theoretical calculations further elucidate the Na+ storage mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO in 100%: The Synergistic Effect of Nickel and Europiumin Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic transition&#8208;rare earth metal (3d&#8208;4f) clusters with synergestic catalytic activity are rarely identified. Herein, two families of closely related 3d&#8208;Eu clusters were designed to analyze the role of Eu(III) ions during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO. The [M24Eu8] family, where M = Co or Ni, shows much lower activity (CO production &lt; 2078 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) compared to the [M24Eu10] family (CO production &gt; 5838 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). This is due to the two additional Eu(III) ions in the apical position of the latter which are very active for converting CO2 into CO. Moreover, we found the nickel analogues are better than the cobalt ones, especially for [Ni24Eu10] which exhibits 100 % CO selectivity and very high efficacy of 6545.3 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, while the [Co24Eu10] only shows 55 % CO selectivity. Therefore, the coexistence of both apical Eu(III) and Ni(II) ions has been experimentally revealed to be critical for this exceptional catalytic performance of the [Ni24Eu10] cluster. As such, this work unambiguously reveals a synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts and may open a new avenue for more sophisticated reaction design by using the heterometallic coordination clusters</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric,&#160;Corner&#8208;Sharing&#160;CuO5 and CuO6 Motifs in Cu&#8208;Based Metallic Perovskite Oxides Boosting Asymmetric C&#8208;C Coupling for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) but encounter insufficient C2+ selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with&#160;asymmetric,&#160;corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs to boost asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst of La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, their ordered, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 pyramids and CuO6 octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#8208;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#8208;O covalency. In CO2RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; greatly promotes C2+ formation while producing negligible CH4, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C2+ to CH4) of up to 180. Moreover, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, achieving a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400 mA cm&#8208;2, together with well&#8208;boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO5&#8208;CuO6 sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#8208;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#8208;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, polymer&#8208;containing Cage&#8208;POPs and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.</dc:description>
