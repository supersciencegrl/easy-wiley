         <title>Methane Oxidation over Cu2+/[CuOH]+ Pairs and Site&#8208;Specific Kinetics in Copper Mordenite Revealed by Operando Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and UV&#8208;Visible Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;exchanged mordenite (MOR) is a promising material for partial CH4 oxidation. The structural diversity of Cu species within MOR makes it difficult to identify the active Cu sites and to determine their redox and kinetic properties. In this study, the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;MOR materials with different Cu loadings has been determined using operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy as well as in situ photoluminescence (PL) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A novel pathway for CH4 oxidation involving paired [CuOH]+ and bare Cu2+ species has been identified. The reduction of bare Cu2+ ions facilitated by adjacent [CuOH]+ demonstrates that the frequently reported assumption of redox&#8208;inert Cu2+ centers does not generally apply. The measured site&#8208;specific reaction kinetics show that dimeric Cu species exhibit a faster reaction rate and a higher apparent activation energy than monomeric Cu2+ active sites highlighting their difference in the CH4 oxidation potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Induced Large Electronic Conductivity Change of 107&#160;on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Sensitive Water Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic conductivity (EC) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is sensitive to guest molecules with strong oxidation. Water, nearly ubiquitous, is a relatively mild species, however the effect of H2O on the EC of MOFs is rarely reported. Herein, we explored the effect of H2O on EC in representative MOFs, (NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and its derivatives, by experimental and theoretical investigations. Unexpectedly, a large EC increase of 107 on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 by H2O was observed. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8211;base pairs formed between the &#8208;NH2 and H2SO4 played an important role in promoting the charge transfer from H2O to MOF and resulted in large change in the EC. Based on H2SO4@(NH2)2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, an high&#8208;performance chemiresistive humidity sensing material was developed with the highest sensitivity, broadest detection range and lowest limit of detection amongst all the reported sensing materials. This work not only demonsrate that H2O with a weak oxidation nature could remarkably influence the EC of MOFs, but it also revealed that the post&#8208;modification of the structure of MOFs could enhance the influence of the guest molecule on their EC to design high&#8208;performance sensing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted TADF Molecules and Their Applications in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted great potential in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Among thousands of TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters has become a hotspot in recent years. Compared with traditional TADF materials, highly twisted TADF emitters tend to show multi&#8208;channel charge transfer characters and form rigid molecular structures. This is advantageous for TADF materials as non&#8208;radiative decay processes can be suppressed to facilitate efficient exciton utilization. Accordingly, OLEDs with excellent device performances have also been reported. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress of highly twisted TADF materials and related devices, and overviewed the molecular design strategies, photophysical studies and the performances of OLED devices. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of highly twisted TADF molecules and relative OLEDs are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked F&#8208;rich Polymer to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Sustainable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells have demonstrated commercial viability, but still face the risk of contamination from lead leakage and long&#8208;term stability problems caused by defects. Here, an organic small molecule (octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208; hexanediol diacrylate) is introduced into the perovskite film to form a polymer through in&#8208;situ thermal crosslinking, of which the carbonyl group anchors the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite and reduces the leakage of lead, along with the &#8208;CF2&#8208; hydrophobic group protecting the Pb2+ from water invasion. Additionally, the polymer passivates varieties of Pb&#8208;related and I&#8208;related defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding interactions, regulating the crystallization of perovskite film with reduced trap density, releasing lattice strain, and promoting carrier transport and extraction. The optimal efficiencies of polymer&#8208;incorporated devices are 24.76% (0.09 cm2) and 20.66% (14 cm2). More importantly, the storage stability, thermal stability, and operational stability have been significantly improved.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;driven Reduction of CO2&#160;to Acetate with 100% Selectivity by SnS Nanobelt Piezocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 chemicals such as acetate with high selectivity and efficiency is a critical issue in renewable energy storage. Herein, for the first time we present a vibration&#8208;driven piezocatalysis with tin (II) monosulfide (SnS) nanobelts for conversion of CO2 to acetate with 100% selectivity, and the highest production rate (2.21 mM h&#8722;1) compared with reported catalysts. Mechanism analysis reveal that the polarized charges triggered by periodic mechanical vibration promote the adsorption and activation of CO2. The electron transfer can be facilitated due to built&#8208;in electric field, decreased band gap and work function of SnS under stress. Remarkably, reduced distance between active sites leads to charge enrichment on Sn sites, promoting the C&#8208;C coupling, reducing the energy barriers of the rate determining step. It puts forward a bran&#8208;new strategy for converting CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products with efficient, low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly piezocatalysis utilizing mechanical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Boost Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrolysis of Ammonia Borane: Nickel&#8211;Platinum Nanoparticles Supported on Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Titania</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia borane (AB) is a promising material for chemical H2 storage owing to its high H2 density (up to 19.6 wt%). However, the development of an efficient catalyst for driving H2 evolution through AB hydrolysis remains challenging. Therefore, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven strategy for generating H2 through AB hydrolysis was implemented in this study using Ni&#8211;Pt nanoparticles supported on phosphorus&#8208;doped TiO2 (Ni&#8211;Pt/P&#8208;TiO2) as photocatalysts. Through surface engineering, P&#8208;TiO2 was prepared by phytic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted phosphorization and then employed as an ideal support for immobilizing Ni&#8211;Pt nanoparticles via a facile co&#8208;reduction strategy. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation at 283 K, Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 exhibited improved recyclability and a high turnover frequency of 967.8 molH2&#8729;molPt&#8208;1&#8729;min&#8208;1. Characterization experiments and density functional theory calculations indicated that the enhanced performance of Ni40Pt60/P&#8208;TiO2 originated from a combination of the Ni&#8211;Pt alloying effect, the Mott&#8211;Schottky junction at the metal&#8211;semiconductor interface, and strong metal&#8211;support interactions. These findings not only underscore the benefits of utilizing multipronged effects to construct highly active AB&#8208;hydrolyzing catalysts, but also pave a path toward designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by surface engineering to modulate the electronic metal&#8211;support interactions for other visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of cis&#8208;Decalins by Merging the Birch Reduction and Inverse&#8208;Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we show the combination of the Birch reduction of readily available anisole derivatives and the catalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones can serve as a powerful platform for the diverse synthesis of synthetically important cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds. Enabled by a well&#8208;modified chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand/Cu(II) complex, a wide range of polysubstituted cis&#8208;decalin scaffolds with up to six continuous stereocenters was generated efficiently. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by the concise synthesis of sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;occidentalol and a key intermediate for seven triterpenes. Mechanistic studies suggest the in situ formed 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadienes are the key intermediates, and efficient kinetic resolution occurs when C2 and/or C3 substituted 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes are utilized as substrates. DFT calculations elucidate the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction proceeds in a stepwise fashion, and reveal the originations of the stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Dipyrromethene&#8208;Based Fluorescent Emitters Enable High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Red Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Didoes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are receiving significant attention and have demonstrated impressive performance in blue and green OLEDs. However, developing high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs remains a highly desired yet challenging task. Herein, we have developed narrowband red fluorescent emitters by utilizing a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton in combination with a methyl&#8208;shield strategy. These emitters exhibit small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) ranging from 21 nm (0.068 eV) to 25 nm (0.081 eV) and high photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) ranging from 88.5% to 99.0% in toluene solution. Using BODIPY&#8208;based luminescent materials as emitters, high&#8208;performance narrowband red OLEDs have been assembled with external quantum efficiency as high as 18.3% at 623 nm and 21.1% at 604 nm. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first successful case of achieving NTSC pure&#8208;red OLEDs with the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of [0.67, 0.33] based on conventional fluorescent emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroatomic&#8208; and heptagons&#8208; doped multiple helicenes were successfully synthesized and confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which exhibit distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circular dichroism (CD) signals, with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values.







Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99&#8201;% and 65&#8201;% with narrow FWHM of 24&#8197;nm and 22&#8197;nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spiro&#8208;type hole transport material (HTM) was developed by extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system (DP). The new HTM features a stabilized HOMO level, a higher glass transition temperature, and improved morphology on the perovskite layer compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. When incorporated into an n&#8208;i&#8208;p device, the DP&#8208;based HTM achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules.







Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24&#8201;% for small&#8208;area (0.06&#8197;cm2) devices and 21.86&#8201;% for modules (designated area of 27.56&#8197;cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78&#8201;% on a designated area of 27.86&#8197;cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1&#8201;% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2560&#8197;hours and 87&#8201;% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600&#8197;hours.

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituent engineering of dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine&#8208;based fluorophores was demonstrated to access broadband triple fluorescent emissions from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm. Mechanistic studies revealed that the steric effect modulates the excited&#8208;state potential energy surface, enabling the molecule to undergo multistep transformation along the sequence of bent, planar, and twisted structures.







Abstract
We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt;500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, the introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.

&lt;p&gt;Substituent engineering of dihydrodibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]phenazine-based fluorophores was demonstrated to access broadband triple fluorescent emissions from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm. Mechanistic studies revealed that the steric effect modulates the excited-state potential energy surface, enabling the molecule to undergo multistep transformation along the sequence of bent, planar, and twisted structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;-scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited-state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room-temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-site of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-diphenyl-dihydrodibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]phenazine (&lt;b&gt;DPAC&lt;/b&gt;), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of &lt;b&gt;DPAC&lt;/b&gt; from a dominant red band to well-resolved triple bands. The ultra-broadband triple emissions of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted &lt;b&gt;DPAC&lt;/b&gt;s range from &#8776;350 to &#8776;850&#8197;nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &amp;lt;500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PES). Compared to the steep S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PES of parental &lt;b&gt;DPAC&lt;/b&gt;, the introduction of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; wider and flatter, so the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited-state structural relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized Terthiophene Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although main group redox systems are attractive as next&#8208;generation energy storage media, achieving high cell voltages via extreme redox couples typically compromises their long&#8208;term stabilities. We show that phosphine oxide functionalization can render terthiophenes robust two&#8208;electron acceptors at very low potentials, thus opening fundamentally new parameter space in the search for stable main group redox systems with high cell voltages.







Abstract
Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8722; reductions at potentials below &#8722;2&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc=ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2&#8201;e&#8722; galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2&#8201;e&#8722; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for the Highly Efficient Synthesis of Benzimidazoles Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a conceptually new, highly efficient radical route for the benzimidazole synthesis via radical&#8208;induced cross&#8208;coupling of alcohols and o&#8208;arylenediamines concomitantly with hydrogen (H2) production over Pd modified ultrathin ZnO NSs (Pd/ZnO) under mild conditions.







Abstract
Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). The mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8208;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazole synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.

         <title>Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicle to phosphoproteins (EVTOP) as a novel strategy achieves one&#8208;pot EV isolation, extraction and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides starting with microliters of biofluids, enabling ultrasensitive EV phosphoproteome analyses of challenging biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid with limited volume.







Abstract
Many biological processes are regulated through dynamic protein phosphorylation. Monitoring disease&#8208;relevant phosphorylation events in circulating biofluids is highly appealing but also technically challenging. We introduce here a functionally tunable material and a strategy, extracellular vesicles to phosphoproteins (EVTOP), which achieves one&#8208;pot extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation, extraction, and digestion of EV proteins, and enrichment of phosphopeptides, with only a trace amount of starting biofluids. EVs are efficiently isolated by magnetic beads functionalized with TiIV ions and a membrane&#8208;penetrating peptide, octa&#8208;arginine R8+, which also provides the hydrophilic surface to retain EV proteins during lysis. Subsequent on&#8208;bead digestion concurrently converts EVTOP to TiIV ion&#8208;only surface for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides for phosphoproteomic analyses. The streamlined, ultra&#8208;sensitive platform enabled us to quantify 500&#8197;unique EV phosphopeptides with only a few &#956;L of plasma and over 1200&#8197;phosphopeptides with 100&#8197;&#956;L of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We explored its clinical application of monitoring the outcome of chemotherapy of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) patients with a small volume of CSF, presenting a powerful tool for broad clinical applications.

         <title>An Aqueous Electrolyte Gated Artificial Synapse with Synaptic Plasticity Selectively Mediated by Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial synapse where non&#8208;relevant biomolecules (urea, lactic acid (LA) and fructose (Fru)) cannot modulate its plasticity, while only relevant biomolecules (glucose) can selectively activate the device and induce long&#8208;term modulation and memory effect. The device works properly in blood serum and shows enhanced synaptic behaviors at high glucose concentrations, suggesting its potential application as artificial neurons in vivo.







Abstract
The emulation of functions and behaviors of biological synapses using electronic devices has inspired the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in biomedical interfaces. Despite the achievements, artificial synapses that can be selectively responsive to non&#8208;electroactive biomolecules and directly operate in biological environments are still lacking. Herein, we report an artificial synapse based on organic electrochemical transistors and investigate the selective modulation of its synaptic plasticity by glucose. The enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase results in long&#8208;term modulation of the channel conductance, mimicking selective binding of biomolecules to their receptors and consequent long&#8208;term modulation of the synaptic weight. Moreover, the device shows enhanced synaptic behaviors in the blood serum at a higher glucose concentration, which suggests its potential application in vivo as artificial neurons. This work provides a step towards the fabrication of ANNs with synaptic plasticity selectively mediated by biomolecules for neuro&#8208;prosthetics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The systematic high&#8208;throughput investigation of the system AlCl3/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O led to the discovery of a series of porous salts from readily available starting materials in high yields. In situ crystallisation studies confirm the rapid formation of the highly crystalline compounds within minutes under mild conditions.







Abstract
The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, HSO4&#8722;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt;95&#8201;%, 215&#8197;g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 430&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140&#8197;nm and 1250&#8197;nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

&lt;p&gt;The systematic high-throughput investigation of the system AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH/NaOH/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O led to the discovery of a series of porous salts from readily available starting materials in high yields. In situ crystallisation studies confirm the rapid formation of the highly crystalline compounds within minutes under mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, denoted CAU-55-X, with X=Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Three-dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in water were established resulting in high yields (&amp;gt;95&#8201;%, 215&#8197;g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O capacities with maximum values of up to 930&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 430&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are observed. The particle size of CAU-55-X can be tuned between 140&#8197;nm and 1250&#8197;nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders.

         <title>Alkali Chloride Adducts of Acyclic Acylaluminum: Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Two acyclic acylaluminums and one cyclic acylaluminum dimer were synthesized by reaction of the recently reported Al&#8208;anion with acyl chloride. The reaction of the acylaluminums with TMSOTf and DMAP gave a ring&#8208;expanded iminium&#8208;substituted aluminate and a 2&#8208;C&#8722;H cleaved product. In the reaction of acylaluminums toward C=O and C=N bonds, acyclic acylaluminums reacted as an acyl nucleophile, while the cycilc dimer showed no reactivity. Amide&#8208;bond forming ligation using acyclic acylaluminums and hydroxylamines was further demonstrated. Throughout the study, acyclic acylaluminums exhibited higher reactivity than that of the cyclic dimer.

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Supramolecular Framework Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework birefringent crystal exhibits strikingly large birefringence of exp. 0.60@550&#8197;nm. This attribute would enable it to efficiently divide an incident ray into different polarized rays (o ray and e ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals could modulate the polarization of light and are widely used as polarizers, waveplates, optical isolators, etc. To date, commercial birefringent crystals have been exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds such as &#945;&#8208;BaB2O4 with birefringence of about 0.12. Herein, we report a new hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework, namely, Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O, which exhibits exceptionally large birefringence up to about 0.60. To the best of our knowledge, the birefringence of Cd(H2C6N7O3)2&#8901;8&#8201;H2O is significantly larger than those of all commercial birefringent crystals and is the largest among hydrogen bonded supramolecular framework crystals. First&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that the exceptional birefringence is mainly ascribed to strong covalent interactions within (H2C6N7O3)&#8722; organic ligands and the perfect coplanarity between them. Given the rich structural diversity and tunability, hydrogen bonded supramolecular frameworks would offer unprecedented opportunities beyond the traditional purely inorganic oxides for birefringent crystals.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Alkoxide Powered Zincation of Fluoroarenes Employing Zinc Bis&#8208;Amide Zn(TMP)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the metalation potential of Zn(TMP)2 the addition of KOtBu enables the activation of its amide groups to promote the regioselective zincation of a range of fluoroarenes forming higher order potassium zincates. This methodology can even be extended to non&#8208;activated arenes toluene and benzene under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Reminiscent of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser superbase recipes, the addition of two molar equivalents of KOtBu to Zn(TMP)2 (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) transforms this mild zinc bis&#8208;amide base to a powerful metalating agent able to perform facile regioselective zincation of a wide range of sensitive fluoroarenes. Structural authentication of the intermediates post Zn&#8722;H exchange demonstrates activation of both TMP groups to form a range of higher order bis&#8208;aryl potassium zincates, isolable as solids and further functionalized in electrophilic interception reactions. Studies assessing the role of KOtBu reveal that the first equivalent undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Zn(TMP)2, enabling kinetic activation of the amide groups; whereas the second equivalent stabilizes the metalated intermediate preventing ligand redistribution. Showcasing its metalating power, this bimetallic KOtBu/Zn(TMP)2 partnership, can effect zincation of toluene and benzene at room temperature.

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel architecture with FeP nanodots fully embedded in nitrogen doped carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) . Such a structure allows the stress transfer between FeP nanodots and self&#8208;adaptive carbon matrix in sodium storage, which overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), which outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated iontronic nanotool was developed for the study of single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation. With the nanotool, an N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;modified deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) was used for profiling a representative m6&#8197;A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO), which also released a DNA sequence that could be programmed as an antisense strand against intracellular FTO&#8208;mRNA.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell studies; however, solutions to epigenetic questions remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within a nanopipette for profiling a representative m6A&#8208;modifying enzyme, fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.

         <title>Design of the Ionic Organic Nonlinear Optical Material NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4] with Ultrawide Band Gap and Moderate Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent organic flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit, through reasonable nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;favourable layered design, a deep&#8208;ultraviolet ionic organic nonlinear optical crystal, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], with an ultrawide band gap and moderate birefringence was successfully obtained.







Abstract
Ionic organic crystals containing organic planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated units has become one of the hot spots as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although this type of ionic organic NLO crystals commonly have remarkable second harmonic generation (SHG) responses, they also suffer from overlarge birefringences and relatively small band gaps that be hardly beyond 6.2&#8197;eV. Herein, a flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated [C3H(CH3)O4]2&#8722; unit was theoretically revealed, showing great potential for designing NLO crystals with balanced optical properties. Accordingly, through the reasonable NLO&#8208;favourable layered design, a new ionic organic material, NH4[LiC3H(CH3)O4], was successfully obtained. As expected, it achieves not only a large SHG effect (4&#215;KDP), but also a suitable birefringence (0.06@546&#8197;nm) and an ultrawide band gap (&gt;6.5&#8197;eV). This study provides a new flexible &#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO&#8208;active unit, contributing to design more ionic organic NLO materials with excellent balanced optical properties.

         <title>Disc&#8208;Like Silver Nanocluster Ag93 Built with Bicapped Hexagonal Prismatic Ag15 and Ino Decahedral Ag13 Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4) is prepared. It is a disc&#8208;shaped structure, its Ag69 kernel consists of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 wrapped by six Ino decahedral Ag13 units through edge&#8208;sharing. The central silver atom has an unprecedented high coordination number of 14. This is the first time that Ino decahedra act as building blocks to assemble a supercluster.







Abstract
The reduction of alkynyl&#8208;silver and phosphine&#8208;silver precursors with a weak reducing reagent Ph2SiH2 led to the formation of a novel silver nanocluster [Ag93(PPh3)6(C&#8801;CR)50]3+ (R=4&#8208;CH3OC6H4), which is the largest structurally characterized cluster of clusters. This disc&#8208;shaped cluster has a Ag69 kernel consisting of a bicapped hexagonal prismatic Ag15 unit wrapped by six Ino decahedra through edge&#8208;sharing. This is the first time that Ino decahedra are used as a building block to assemble a cluster of clusters. Moreover, the central silver atom has a coordination number of 14, which is the highest in metal nanoclusters. This work provides a diverse metal packing pattern in metal nanoclusters, which is helpful for understanding metal cluster assembling mechanisms.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydroalkenylation and Hydroalkynylation of Alkenes Enabled by a Transient Directing Group: Catalyst Generality through Rigidification
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of tert&#8208;leucine as a chiral transient directing group enables the enantioselective reductive&#8208;Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl benzaldehydes under palladium catalysis. The dual catalytic reaction proceeds under mild conditions and offers high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral alkenes and alkynes represents a powerful strategy for rapid generation of molecular complexity. Herein, we report a transient directing group (TDG) strategy to facilitate site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed reductive Heck&#8208;type hydroalkenylation and hydroalkynylation of alkenylaldehyes using alkenyl and alkynyl bromides, respectively, allowing for construction of a stereocenter at the &#948;&#8208;position with respect to the aldehyde. Computational studies reveal the dual beneficial roles of rigid TDGs, such as L&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine, in promoting TDG binding and inducing high levels of enantioselectivity in alkene insertion with a variety of migrating groups.

         <title>Tailoring Ion Ordering in Perovskite Oxide for High&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities as the anodes of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the relationship between the ion ordering and OER performances is rarely investigated. Herein, a series of PrBaCo2&#8722;xFexO5+&#948; perovskites with tailored ion orderings are constructed. Physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the oxygen bulk migration and surface transport capacities as well as the OER activities are promoted by the A&#8208;site cation ordering, but weakened by the oxygen vacancy ordering. Hence, SOEC with the A&#8208;site&#8208;ordered and oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;disordered PrBaCo2O5+&#948; anode exhibits the highest performance of 3.40 A cm&#8722;2 at 800 &#176;C and 2.0 V. This work sheds light on the critical role of ion orderings in the high&#8208;temperature OER performance and paves a new way for screening novel anode materials of SOECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Structure with Enhanced Anionic Coordination for Stable Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries have garnered much attention due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the irreversible lithium plating/stripping on the anode limits their performance, which has been paid little attention. Herein, a solvation&#8208;regulated strategy for stable lithium anodes in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4) based electrolyte is attempted in Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Trifluoroacetate anions (TFA&#8208;) with strong Li+ affinity are incorporated into the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/G4 electrolyte to attenuate the Li+&#8208;G4 interaction and form anion&#8208;dominant solvates. The bisalt electrolyte with 0.5 M LiTFA and 0.5 M LiTFSI mitigates G4 decomposition and induces an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This contributes to decreased desolvation energy barrier from 58.20 to 46.31 kJ mol&#8208;1, compared with 1.0 M LiTFSI/G4, for facile interfacial Li+ diffusion and high efficiency. It yields extended lifespan of 120 cycles in Li&#8208;O2 battery with a limited Li anode (7 mAh cm&#8208;2). This work gains comprehensive insights into rational electrolyte design for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Variations in Intracellular Organometallic Reaction Frequency Captured by Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies of organometallic reactions in living cells commonly rely on ensemble&#8208;averaged measurements, which can obscure the detection of reaction dynamics or location&#8208;specific behavior. This information is necessary to guide the design of bioorthogonal catalysts with improved biocompatibility, activity, and selectivity. By leveraging the high spatial and temporal resolution of single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy, we have successfully captured single&#8208;molecule events promoted by Ru complexes inside live A549 human lung cells. By observing individual allylcarbamate cleavage reactions in real&#8208;time, our results revealed that they occur with greater frequency inside the mitochondria than in the non&#8208;mitochondria regions. The estimated turnover frequency of the Ru complexes was at least 3&#8208;fold higher in the former than the latter. These results suggest that organelle specificity is a critical factor to consider in intracellular catalyst design, such as in developing metallodrugs for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Reactivity Study of a Versatile Trifluoromethylthiolating Agent: S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Trifluoromethanesulfonothioate (TTST)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel, air and thermally stable, yet highly reactive trifluoromethylthiolating reagent, CF3SO2SCF3 (1), was prepared easily in one step from commercially inexpensive CF3SO2Na and Tf2O. 1 is a highly versatile and atom&#8208;efficient reagent that can generate one equivalent of CF3S+, two equivalents of CF3S&#8208;, or a combination of CF3S./CF3. species. Many high&#8208;yielding CF3S reactions of C, O, S, and N&#8208;nucleophiles were achieved, including the simple&#8208;step preparations of many reported CF3S reagents. 1 delivered a hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize ArSOCF3 that was followed by a novel CF3SII&#8208;rearrangement. Through Cu or TDAE/Ph3P combinations, 1 generated two equivalents of CF3S anion species, and the photo&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkenes with 1 provided CF3/CF3S&#8208;containing products in high atom&#8208;efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high and low&#8208;sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure&#8208;function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well&#8208;defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7 &#8211; 12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insights, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off&#8208;target platelet factor&#8208;4 protein. This work contributes to a better understanding of HS&#8208;protein interactions and provides a useful tool for the development of anti&#8208;heparanase therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Chemistry Derived Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes Working at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 and 20 mAh cm&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is crucial for lithium metal anode (LMA) to survive in long&#8208;term cycling. However, chaotic structures and chemical inhomogeneity of natural SEI make LMA suffer from exasperating dendrite growth and severe electrode pulverization, hindering the practical application of LMAs. Here, we design a catalyst&#8208;derived artificial SEI layer with an ordered polyamide (PA)&#8208;LiOH (PA&#8208;LiOH) bi&#8208;phase structure to modulate ion transport and enable dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition. The PA&#8208;LiOH layer can substantially suppress the volume changes of LMA during cyclic Li plating/stripping, as well as the parasitic reactions between LMA and electrolyte. The optimized LMAs demonstrate excellent stability in cyclic Li plating/stripping tests for over 1000 hours at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20 mA [[EQUATION]] in Li||Li symmetric cells. A high coulombic efficiency up to 99.2% in Li half cells under additive&#8208;free electrolyte is achieved even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1mA cm&#8208;2 with a capacity of 1 mAh cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimeric Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkenylation of Alkynes with a Versatile Silicon&#8208;Based Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a manganese&#8208;catalyzed, branched&#8208;selective hydroalkenylation of terminal alkynes, under mild conditions through facile installation of a versatile silanol as a removable directing group. With an alkenyl boronic acid as the coupling partner, this reaction produces stereodefined (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with high regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The protocol features mild reaction conditions such as room temperature and an air atmosphere, while maintaining excellent functional group compatibility. The resulting 1,3&#8208;dienesilanol products serve as versatile building blocks, as the removal of the silanol group allows for the synthesis of both branched terminal 1,3&#8208;dienes for downstream coupling reactions, as well as stereoselective construction of linear (E,E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes and (E,E,E)&#8208; or (E,E,Z)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienes. In addition, a Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition can smoothly and selectively deliver silicon&#8208;containing pentasubstituted cyclohexene derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, in conjunction &#160;with DFT calculations, suggest a bimetallic synergistic activation model to account for the observed enhanced catalytic efficiency and good regioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Histidine&#8208;Rich Peptides Enhance Endosomal Escape for Antibody&#8208;Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal&#160;entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome&#8208;to&#8208;cytosol delivery based on an extension of the "histidine switch" principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH&#8208;dependent membrane&#8208;perturbation activity. These peptides that do not penetrate cells randomly (like CPPs) yet do imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16&#8208;residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and successively achieved antibody&#8208;targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes &#8212;including the pro&#8208;apoptotic protein BID (BH3&#8208;interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase &#8212;into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab&#8208;hsLMWP&#8208;BID fusion conferred strong anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, immunotherapy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is mainly limited to the modulation of diseases in extracellular spaces. Intracellular targets are hardly accessed, owing largely to the endosomal&#160;entrapment of internalized proteins/peptides. Here, we report a strategy to design and construct peptides that enable endosome-to-cytosol delivery based on an extension of the "histidine switch" principle. By substituting the Arg/Lys residues in cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with histidine, we obtained peptides with pH-dependent membrane-perturbation activity. These peptides that do not penetrate cells randomly (like CPPs) yet do imitate the endosomal escape of CPPs following cellular uptake. Working with one such 16-residue peptide (hsLMWP) with high endosomal escape capacity, we engineered modular fusion proteins and successively achieved antibody-targeted delivery of diverse protein cargoes &#8212;including the pro-apoptotic protein BID (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) and Cre recombinase &#8212;into the cytosol of multiple cancer cell types. After extensive in vitro testing, an in vivo analysis with xenograft mice ultimately demonstrated that a trastuzumab-hsLMWP-BID fusion conferred strong anti-tumor efficacy without apparent side effects. Notably, our fusion protein features a modular design, allowing flexible applications for any antibody/cargo combination of choice. Therefore, the potential applications extend throughout life science and biomedicine, including gene editing, cancer treatment, immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing Capacity Degradation of Ge Anode Triggered by Interfacial LiH Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Germanium (Ge), as a fast&#8208;charging and high specific capacity (1568 mAh g&#8722;1) alloy anode, is greatly hampered in practical application by poor cyclability. To date, the understanding of cycling performance degradation remains elusive. This study illustrates that, contrary to conventional beliefs, most of the Ge material in failed anodes still retains good integrity and does not undergo severe pulverization. It is revealed that capacity degradation is clearly correlated to the interfacial evolution of lithium hydride (LiH). Tetralithium germanium hydride (Li4Ge2H), as a new species derived from LiH, is identified as the culprit of Ge anode degradation, which is the dominant crystalized component in an ever&#8208;growing and ever&#8208;insulating interphase. The significantly increased thickness of SEI is accompanied by the accumulation of insulating Li4Ge2H upon cycling, which severely retards the charge transport process and ultimately triggers the anode failure. We believe that the comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism presented in this study is of great significance to promoting the design and development of alloy anode for the next generation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparative Scale Applications of C&#8211;H Activation in Medicinal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H activation is an attractive methodology to increase molecular complexity without requiring substrate prefunctionalization. In contrast to well&#8208;established cross&#8208;coupling methods, C&#8211;H activation is less explored on large scales and its use in the production of pharmaceuticals faces substantial hurdles. However, the inherent advantages, such as shorter synthetic routes and simpler starting materials, motivate medicinal chemists and process chemists to overcome these challenges, and exploit C&#8211;H activation steps for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. In this review, we will cover examples of drugs/drug candidates where C&#8211;H activation has been implemented on a preparative synthetic scale (range between 355 mg and 130 kg). The optimization processes will be described, and each example will be examined in terms of its advantages and disadvantages, providing the reader with an in&#8208;depth understanding of the challenges and potential of C&#8211;H activation methodologies in the production of pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of the Bacterial Sesterviridene Synthase from Kitasatospora viridis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A gene coding for a terpene synthase homolog from Kitasatospora viridis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein possessed sesterterpene synthase activity and efficiently converted geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP) with 19% yield into the sesterterpene hydrocarbon sesterviridene A. Large scale enzymatic conversions also allowed for the isolation of two side products that are generated with very low yields of ca. 0.1%. Several derivatives of sesterviridene A were obtained by chemical transformations, securing the NMR&#8208;based structural assignments. The absolute configuration of sesterviridene A was determined by chemical correlation using stereoselectively deuterated precursors and by anomalous dispersion X&#8208;ray crystallography. The cyclisation mechanism from GFPP to sesterviridene A was extensively studied through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamical Equilibrium between Br&#248;nsted and Lewis Sites in Zeolites: Framework&#8208;Associated Octahedral Aluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the structures of Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolites are well understood, those of Lewis acid sites (LAS) remain an active area of investigation.&#160;Under hydrated conditions, the reversible formation of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminum has been observed in zeolites in the acidic form. However, the structure and formation mechanisms are currently unknown. In this work, combined experimental&#160;27Al NMR spectroscopy and computational data reveal for the first time the details of the zeolite framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium. The octahedral LAS site becomes kinetically allowed and thermodynamically stable under wet conditions in the presence of multiple nearby BAS sites.&#160;The critical condition for the existence of such octahedral LAS appears to be the availability of three protons: at lower proton concentration, either by increasing the Si/Al or by ion&#8208;exchange to non&#8208;acidic form, the tetrahedral BAS becomes thermodynamically more stable. This work resolves the question about the nature and reversibility of framework&#8208;associated octahedral aluminium in zeolites</dc:description>

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Directed Proximity&#8208;Driven Crosslinking Method for Native Peptide Bicyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and site&#8208;specific modification of native peptides and proteins is desirable for synthesizing antibody&#8208;drug conjugates as well as for constructing chemically modified peptide libraries using genetically encoded platforms such as phage display. In particular, there is much interest in efficient multicyclization of native peptides due to the appeals of multicyclic peptides as therapeutics. However, conventional approaches for multicyclic peptide synthesis require orthogonal protecting groups or non&#8208;proteinogenic clickable handles. Herein, we report a cysteine&#8208;directed proximity&#8208;driven strategy for the constructing bicyclic peptides from simple natural peptide precursors. This linear to bicycle transformation initiates with rapid cysteine labeling, which then triggers proximity&#8208;driven amine&#8208;selective cyclization. This bicyclization proceeds rapidly under physiologic conditions, yielding bicyclic peptides with a Cys&#8208;Lys&#8208;Cys, Lys&#8208;Cys&#8208;Lys or N&#8208;terminus&#8208;Cys&#8208;Cys stapling pattern. We demonstrate the utility and power of this strategy by constructing bicyclic peptides fused to proteins as well as to the M13 phage, paving the way to phage display of novel bicyclic peptide libraries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this article we report that a cationic version of Akiba&#8217;s Bi(III) complex catalyzes the reduction of amides to amines using silane as hydride donor. The catalytic system features low catalyst loadings and mild conditions, en route to secondary and tertiary aryl&#8208; and alkylamines. The system permits that functional groups such as alkene, alkyne, ester, nitrile, furan, and thiophene remain intact. Kinetic studies on the reaction mechanism result in the identification of a reaction network with an important product inhibition that is in agreement with the experimental reaction profiles.</dc:description>

A variety of arylidenecyclopropanes reacted with pinacolborane (HBpin) to form the corresponding 1,3&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;diboronates in high isolated yields and with high regioselectivity. Skipped diboronate products from these reactions can undergo various transformations to allow selective installation of two different functional groups along alkyl chains. Mechanistic studies suggest that these reactions combine cobalt&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydroboration of arylidenecyclopropanes and hydroboration of homoallylic or allylic boronate intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Comparison of Lysine versus Site&#8208;Specific Protein Surface Immobilization in Single&#8208;molecule Mechanical Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is powerful for studying folding states and mechanical properties of proteins, however, it requires protein immobilization onto force&#8208;transducing probes such as cantilevers or microbeads. A common immobilization method relies on coupling lysine residues to carboxylated surfaces using 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;aminopropyl) carbodiimide and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Because proteins typically contain many lysine groups, this strategy results in a heterogeneous distribution of tether positions. Genetically encoded peptide tags (e.g., ybbR) provide alternative chemistries for achieving site&#8208;specific immobilization, but thus far a direct comparison of site&#8208;specific vs. lysine&#8208;based immobilization strategies to assess effects on the observed mechanical properties was lacking. Here, we compared lysine&#8208; vs. ybbR&#8208;based protein immobilization in SMFS assays using several model polyprotein systems. Our results show that lysine&#8208;based immobilization results in significant signal deterioration for monomeric streptavidin&#8208;biotin interactions, and loss of the ability to correctly classify unfolding pathways in a multipathway Cohesin&#8208;Dockerin system. We developed a mixed immobilization approach where a site&#8208;specifically tethered ligand was used to probe surface&#8208;bound proteins immobilized through lysine groups, and found partial recovery of specific signals. The mixed immobilization approach represents a viable alternative for mechanical assays on&#160;in vivo&#8208;derived samples or other proteins of interest where genetically encoded tags are not feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Heteroatom&#8208;Hydrogen Bonds Bridging Electron Transport in Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Supramolecular System for Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular systems consisting of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and Ni complex are designed for robust photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Multiple heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonding between the COF and Ni complex is identified to play a decisive role in the photoexcited electron transfer across the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The diminution of steric groups on COF or metal complex can optimize catalytic performance, which is more attributable to the enhanced hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction rather than their intrinsic activity. The photosystem with relatively strong strength of hydrogen bonds exhibits remarkable photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, far superior to photosystems with supported atomic Ni or metal complex alone in the absence of hydrogen&#8208;bond effect. Such heteroatom&#8208;hydrogen bonds bridging electron transport pathway confers supramolecular system with high photocatalytic performance, providing an avenue to rationally design efficient and steadily available photosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photosensitizer Coupled Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we innovatively assembled two types of traditional photosensitizers, that is pyridine ruthenium/ferrum (Ru(bpy)32+/Fe(bpy)32+) and porphyrin/metalloporphyrin complex (2HPor/ZnPor) by covalent linkage to get a series of dual photosensitizer&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (3D MCOFs), which behaved strong visible light&#8208;absorbing ability, efficient electron transfer and suitable band gap for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution. Rubpy&#8208;ZnPor COF achieved the highest H2 yield (30338 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8208;1) with apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.68%@420 nm, which showed one of the best performances among all reported COF based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ produced H2 was successfully tandem used in the alkyne hydrogenation with ~99.9% efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that both the two photosensitizer units in MCOFs can be photoexcited and thus contribute optimal photocatalytic activity. This work develops a general strategy and shows the great potential of using multiple photosensitive materials in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum Metallacycle&#8208;Based Molecular Recognition: Establishment and Application in Spontaneous Formation of a [2]Rotaxane with Light&#8208;Harvesting Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic molecule&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems, which provide contributions for the design and construction of functional supramolecular structures, have gained increasing attention in recent years. In particular, platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems provide opportunities for chemical scientists to prepare&#160;novel&#160;materials with various functions and structures due to the well&#8208;defined shapes and cavity sizes of platinum(II) metallacycles. However, the research on platinum(II) metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems has received less attention. In this article, we demonstrate the host&#8211;guest complexation between a platinum(II) metallacycle and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecule, naphthalene. Taking advantage of metallacycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest interactions and the dynamic covalent chemistry in the formation of reversible Pt coordination bonds, a [2]rotaxane is efficiently prepared by employing a template&#8208;directed clipping procedure. The [2]rotaxane is further applied to the fabrication of&#160;&#160;an efficient light&#8208;harvesting system with multi&#8208;step energy transfer process. This work comprises an important supplement to macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems and demonstrates a strategy for efficient production of well&#8208;defined mechanically interlocked molecules with practical values.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Large Pore Apertures and High Surface Areas for NO2 Selective Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with pronounced electrical properties (e. g., high conductivity) has provided a novel platform for efficient energy storage, sensing, and electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the limited availability of suitable ligands restricts the number of available types of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, especially those with large pore apertures and high surface areas are rare. Herein, we develop two new 2D c&#8208;MOFs (HIOTP&#8208;M, M = Ni, Cu) employing a large p&#8208;&#960; conjugated ligand of hexaamino&#8208;triphenyleno[2,3&#8208;b:6,7&#8208;b':10,11&#8208;b'']tris[1,4]benzodioxin (HAOTP). Among the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, HIOTP&#8208;Ni exhibits the largest pore aperture of 3.3 nm and one of the highest surface areas (up to 1300 m2 g&#8208;1). As an exemplary application, HIOTP&#8208;Ni has been used as a chemiresistive sensing material and displays high selective response (405%) and a rapid response (1.69 min) towards 10 ppm NO2 gas. This work demonstrates significant correlation linking the pore aperture of 2D c&#8208;MOFs to their sensing performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Degradation Parameters of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;crystal LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2 (SC&#8208;NCM, x + y + z = 1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long&#8208;term cycling. While advances have been made using SC&#8208;NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC&#8208;NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC&#8208;NCM65 cells showed &gt;77% capacity retention below 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56% for 4.7 V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC&#8208;NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock&#8208;salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-crystal LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 (SC-NCM, x + y + z = 1) cathodes are renowned for their high structural stability and reduced accumulation of adverse side products during long-term cycling. While advances have been made using SC-NCM cathode materials, careful studies of cathode degradation mechanisms are scarce. Herein, we employed quasi single-crystalline LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.20O2 (SC-NCM65) to test the relationship between cycling performance and material degradation for different charge cutoff potentials. The Li/SC-NCM65 cells showed &amp;gt;77% capacity retention below 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li after 400 cycles and revealed a significant decay to 56% for 4.7 V cutoff. We demonstrate that the SC-NCM65 degradation is due to accumulation of rock-salt (NiO) species at the particle surface rather than intragranular cracking or side reactions with the electrolyte. The NiO-type layer formation is also responsible for the strongly increased impedance and transition-metal dissolution. Notably, the capacity loss is found to have a linear relationship with the thickness of the rock-salt surface layer. Density functional theory and COMSOL Multiphysics modelling analysis further indicate that the charge-transfer kinetics is decisive, as the lower lithium diffusivity of the NiO phase hinders charge transport from the surface to the bulk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Free Ultrasmall Recyclable Iridium(0) Nanoparticles for Regioselective Aromatic Hydrogenation of Phosphine Oxide Scaffolds: An Easy Access to New Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed the recyclable ligand&#8208;free Ir&#8208;H based Ir(0) nanoparticles (NPs) for the first regioselective partial hydrogenation of P(V)&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. Both the isolated and in&#8208;situ generated NPs are catalytically active. Control NMR study revealed the presence of metal&#8217;s surface&#8208;bound hydrides, most likely formed from Ir(0) species. A control NMR study confirmed that HFIP as a solvent was accountable for substrate activation via hydrogen bonding. HRTEM analysis of the catalyst supports the formation of ultrasmall NPs, while XPS analysis confirmed the dominance of Ir(0) in the NPs. The catalytic activity of NPs is broad as showcased by highly regioselective aromatic ring reduction in various phosphine oxides or phosphonates. The study also showcased a novel pathway toward preparing H8&#8208;BINAP and its derivatives without losing enantioselectivity during catalytic events.</dc:description>

         <title>An Implantable Fiber Biosupercapacitor with High Power Density by Multi&#8208;Strand Twisting Functionalized Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable fiber biosupercapacitor with high power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is created by design of a multi&#8208;strand twisted structure. It can be successfully operated in vivo and is demonstrated to achieve the electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve.







Abstract
Biosupercapacitors (BSCs) that can harvest and store chemical energy show great promise for power delivery of biological applications. However, low power density still limits their applications, especially as miniaturized implants. Here, we report an implantable fiber BSC with maximal power density of 22.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to the previous reports. The fiber BSC was fabricated by integrating anode and cathode fibers of biofuel cell with supercapacitor fibers through multi&#8208;strand twisting. This twisting structure endowed many channels inside and high electrochemical active area for efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer among different fibers, benefiting high power output. The obtained thin and flexible fiber BSC operated stably under deformations and performed high biocompatibility after implantation. Eventually, the fiber BSC was implanted subcutaneously in rats and successfully realized electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve, showing promise as a power source in vivo.

         <title>Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;Enabled Cell&#8208;Surface Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling toward More Efficient Capture of Physically Interacting Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;1O2&#8208;hydrazide system is a photocatalytic proximity labeling system on the cell surface, which enables a more efficient capture of physically interacting cells. This system can be employed to identify trace cellular interactions and serves as a &#8220;live&#8221; TCR multimer to discriminate dendritic cells presenting different antigens, which paves the way for exploring the heterogeneity of antigen&#8208;presenting cells.







Abstract
Intercellular proximity labeling has emerged as a promising approach to enable the study of cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs), but the efficiency of current platforms is limited. Here, we use Ru(bpy)32+ to construct an efficient photocatalytic proximity labeling (PPL) system on the cell surface that allows the highly discriminative CCI detection with spatiotemporal resolution. Through the mechanism study and quantitative characterization on living cells, we demonstrate that the singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mechanism is more efficient and specific than the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism in Ru&#8208;mediated PPL. Ru(bpy)32+ catalysts with different cell&#8208;anchoring moieties are prepared to facilitate the catalyst loading on primary cells. Finally, based on this system, we develop a &#8220;live&#8221; T cell receptor (TCR) multimer with TCR&#8208;T cells that could sensitively identify and discriminate cells presenting antigens of different affinity, providing a powerful tool to better understand the heterogeneity of antigen presenting cells.

         <title>Merging Styrene and Diene Structures to a Cyclic Diene: Anionic Polymerization of 1&#8208;Vinylcyclohexene (VCH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic living polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH) with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator in cyclohexane is possible. It is a key question whether the monomer acts as a 1,3&#8208;diene or as a styrenic monomer. The cyclic structure of the 1,2&#8208;substituted monomer shows extraordinary consequences on copolymerization behavior, microstructure and thermal behavior, compared to other conventional linear dienes (e.g. butadiene, isoprene).







Abstract
We report the first anionic polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclohexene (VCH). This structure may be considered as an intermediate between dienes and styrene. The polymerization of this cyclic 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;diene proceeded quantitatively in cyclohexane at 25&#8201;&#176;C with sec&#8208;butyllithium as an initiator. The obtained polymers have well&#8208;controlled molecular weights in the range of 5 to 142&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1, controlled by the molar ratio of monomer and initiator, with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#272;&lt;1.07&#8211;1.20). In situ 1H NMR kinetic characterization revealed a weak gradient structure for the copolymers of styrene and VCH, (rSty=2.55, rVCH=0.39). P(VCH) obtained in cyclohexane with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator showed both 1,4&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;incorporation mode (ratio: 64&#8201;:&#8201;36). It was demonstrated that the microstructure of the resulting P(VCH) can be altered by the addition of a modifier (THF), resulting in increasing 3,4&#8208;microstructure (up to 78&#8201;%) and elevated glass&#8208;transition temperature up to 89&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, the monomer VCH polymerizes carbanionically like a diene, however leading to rigid polymers with high glass transition temperature, which provides interesting options for combination with other dienes to well&#8208;defined polymer architectures and materials.

         <title>Colossal Anisotropic Thermal Expansion through Coupling Spin Crossover and Rhombus Deformation in a Hexanuclear {FeIII4FeII2} Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hexanuclear spin crossover compound [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1) was synthesized by assembling the spin crossover FeII units and asymmetric Ppmp ligands into a rhombic core structure. It showed the colossal positive and negative anisotropic thermal expansion coupled with spin transition.







Abstract
Colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion is a key function for microscale or nanoscale actuators in material science. Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)FeIII(CN)3]4[FeII(Ppmp)]2&#8901;2&#8201;CH3OH (1, Tp*=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate and Ppmp=2&#8208;[3&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {FeIII2FeII2}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed that 1 underwent thermally&#8208;induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The FeII site in 1 behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the FeII centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {FeIII2FeII2} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.

&lt;p&gt;A new hexanuclear spin crossover compound [(Tp*)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Ppmp)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;2&#8201;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was synthesized by assembling the spin crossover Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; units and asymmetric Ppmp ligands into a rhombic core structure. It showed the colossal positive and negative anisotropic thermal expansion coupled with spin transition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossal and anisotropic thermal expansion is a key function for microscale or nanoscale actuators in material science. Herein, we present a hexanuclear compound of [(Tp*)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Ppmp)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;2&#8201;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Tp*=hydrotris(3,5-dimethyl-pyrazol-1-yl)borate and Ppmp=2-[3-(2&#8242;-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]pyridine), which has a rhombic core structure abbreviated as {Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; underwent thermally-induced spin transition with the thermal hysteresis. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; site in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; behaved as a spin crossover (SCO) unit, and significant deformation of its octahedron was observed during the spin transition process. Moreover, the distortion of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers actuated anisotropic deformation of the rhombic {Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} core, which was spread over the whole crystal through the subsequent molecular rearrangements, leading to the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion. Our results provide a rational strategy for realizing the colossal anisotropic thermal expansion and shape memory effects by tuning the magnetic bistability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coronaviruses Use ACE2 Monomers as Entry&#8208;Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
dSTORM imaging shows that the entry&#8208;receptor ACE2 of coronaviruses is homogeneously distributed in the plasma membrane of host cells with expression levels of only 1&#8211;2 ACE2 molecules&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2. In contrast to previous reports that suggested binding of multiple spikes per virus to ACE2 homodimers or oligomers our data reveal that ACE2 is expressed as monomer in the plasma membrane in the absence and presence of trimeric spike proteins.







Abstract
The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as entry receptor on cells enabling binding and infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) via trimeric spike (S) proteins protruding from the viral surface. It has been suggested that trimeric S proteins preferably bind to plasma membrane areas with high concentrations of possibly multimeric ACE2 receptors to achieve a higher binding and infection efficiency. Here we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in combination with different labeling approaches to visualize the distribution and quantify the expression of ACE2 on different cells. Our results reveal that endogenous ACE2 receptors are present as monomers in the plasma membrane with densities of only 1&#8211;2 receptors &#956;m&#8722;2. In addition, binding of trimeric S proteins does not induce the formation of ACE2 oligomers in the plasma membrane. Supported by infection studies using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing S proteins our data demonstrate that a single S protein interaction per virus particle with a monomeric ACE2 receptor is sufficient for infection, which provides SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 a high infectivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Deoxidizing Electrolyte Additive Enables Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a major cause of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitation during battery resting, usually attributed to protons. To tackle DO&#8208;induced issues, a chemical strategy for self&#8208;deoxygenation is proposed. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive, effectively improving the stability of Zn in aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, the Zn anode suffers from severe corrosion reactions and consequent dendrite growth troubles that cause fast performance decay. Herein, we uncover the corrosion mechanism and confirm that the dissolved oxygen (DO) other than the reputed proton is a principal origin of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitates, especially during the initial battery resting period. In a break from common physical deoxygenation methods, we propose a chemical self&#8208;deoxygenation strategy to tackle the DO&#8208;induced hazards. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced to aqueous electrolytes as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive. As a result, the Zn anode sustains a long&#8208;term cycling of 2500&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 1100&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 together with a high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6&#8201;%. The full cells also show a high capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles. Our findings provide a renewed understanding of Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes and also a practical solution towards industrializing aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Investigating the Role of Vacancies on the Thermoelectric Properties of EuCuSb&#8208;Eu2ZnSb2 Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermoelectric properties of the EuCuSb&#8208;EuZn0.5Sb solid solution. Vacancies in the planar honeycomb lattice cause a decrease in sound velocity and a sharp increase in point defect scattering, which combine to yield an 80&#8201;% decrease in lattice thermal conductivity. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as the composition varies from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.







Abstract
AMX compounds with the ZrBeSi structure tolerate a vacancy concentration of up to 50&#8201;% on the M&#8208;site in the planar MX&#8208;layers. Here, we investigate the impact of vacancies on the thermal and electronic properties across the full EuCu1&#8722;xZn0.5xSb solid solution. The transition from a fully&#8208;occupied honeycomb layer (EuCuSb) to one with a quarter of the atoms missing (EuZn0.5Sb) leads to non&#8208;linear bond expansion in the honeycomb layer, increasing atomic displacement parameters on the M and Sb&#8208;sites, and significant lattice softening. This, combined with a rapid increase in point defect scattering, causes the lattice thermal conductivity to decrease from 3 to 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;mK&#8722;1 at 300&#8197;K. The effect of vacancies on the electronic properties is more nuanced; we see a small increase in effective mass, large increase in band gap, and decrease in carrier concentration. Ultimately, the maximum zT increases from 0.09 to 0.7 as we go from EuCuSb to EuZn0.5Sb.

         <title>Covalently Linked Hexakis(m&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Macrocycles as Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for constructing organic nanotubes with defined lengths was developed by designing and synthesizing macrocycles with a &#946;&#8208;alanine linker. Oligomeric hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) macrocycles with four macrocyclic units as molecular nanotubes can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;s.







Abstract
The construction of nanotubular structures with non&#8208;deformable inner pores is of both fundamental and practical significance. Herein we report a strategy for creating molecular nanotubes with defined lengths. Macrocyclic (MC) units based on shape&#8208;persistent hexakis(m&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (m&#8208;PE) macrocycle MC&#8208;1, which are known to stack into hydrogen&#8208;bonded tubular assemblies, are tethered by oligo(&#946;&#8208;alanine) linkers to give tubular stacks MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 that have two and four MC units, respectively. The covalently linked MC units in MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 undergo face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking through intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions that further results in the helical stacks of these compounds. Oligomer MC&#8208;4 can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60&#8197;seconds, which is among the longest open durations for synthetic ion channels and indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the self&#8208;assembling channels can be drastically enhanced by reducing the number of molecular components involved. This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by MC&#8208;2 and MC&#8208;4 suggest the likelihood of constructing the next&#8208;generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.

This study demonstrates that covalently tethering shape-persistent macrocyclic units is a feasible and reliable approach for building molecular nanotubes that otherwise are difficult to create de novo. The extraordinarily long lifetimes of the ion channels formed by &lt;b&gt;MC-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MC-4&lt;/b&gt; suggest the likelihood of constructing the next-generation synthetic ion channels with unprecedented stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocurrent Generation and Polarity Switching in Electrochemical Cells through Light&#8208;induced Excited State Proton Transfer of Photoacids and Photobases
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism for photocurrent generation is introduced utilizing an excited state proton transfer (ESPT) mechanism of photoacids and photobases. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer. Tandem irradiation of the photoacid&#8208;photobase is resulting in polarity switching in an H&#8208;cell photoelectrochemical configuration.







Abstract
Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light&#8208;harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light&#8208;responsive energy production or energy storage.

         <title>Multistate Aggregation&#8208;Induced Chiroptical Properties of Enantiopure Disulfide&#8208;Mediated Bispyrene Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective double thiol&#8208;ene addition onto a bis enol ether macrocycle provides chiral disulfide bispyrene macrocycles able to exhibit excimer aggregation&#8208;induced emission predominantly. Upon increasing the water content, ECD and CPL monitoring evidence multistate chiroptical properties, rationalized by TDDFT calculations. Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films and AFM studies help decipher the organization of the luminophores at the interface of water.







Abstract
A chiral bispyrene macrocycle designed for exclusive intermolecular excimer fluorescence upon aggregation was synthesized by a double hydrothiolation of a bis&#8208;enol ether macrocycle followed by intramolecular oxidation of free thiols. Unusually high stereoselectivity was achieved for the thiol&#8208;ene additions under templated conditions and Et3B/O2 radical initiation. After enantiomer separation (chiral stationary phase HPLC), aqueous conditions provoked aggregation. Detailed structural evolution was afforded by ECD/CPL monitoring. Three regimes can be observed and characterized by strong modifications in chiroptical patterns under, at, or above a 70&#8201;% H2O&#8201;:&#8201;THF threshold. In luminescence, high glum dissymmetry factors values were obtained, up to 0.022, as well as a double sign inversion of CPL signals during the aggregation, a behavior rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Langmuir layers of enantiopure disulfide macrocycles were formed at the air&#8211;water interface and transferred onto solid substrates to afford Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett films, which were then studied by AFM and UV/ECD/fluorescence/CPL.

         <title>A Triply [5]Helicene&#8208;Bridged (1,3,5)Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,3,5)cyclophane has been synthesized, in which the triply locked central benzene rings are parallel to each other, perfectly superimposed and rather close. These two benzene rings show abnormally low aromaticity, which is possibly due to the existence of an aromatic 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron macrocyclic circuit.







Abstract
A rigid propeller&#8208;shaped conjugated triple macrocycle consisting of two nearly perfectly stacked benzene rings and three linking [5]helicene moieties has been synthesized using a glyoxylic Perkin approach. Analysis of the electron delocalization in this atypical aromatic molecule revealed global aromaticity and a 78&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuit along the edge of its triple loop, to the detriment of the two 6&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron circuits in the two stacked benzene rings.

         <title>Sulfur Poisoning and Self&#8208;Recovery of Single&#8208;Site Rh1/Porous Organic Polymer Catalysts for Olefin Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even at the ppm level, sulfur poisoning and regeneration are challenges for metal nanoparticle catalysts, but little is known about single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts. Herein, we describe the unique character of single&#8208;site catalysts (Rh1/POPs) that suffer from H2S poisoning, but could self&#8208;recover and be regenerated by simply withdrawing the H2S. The corresponding Rh nanoparticle demonstrated poor activity and could not be regenerated.







Abstract
Sulfur poisoning and regeneration are global challenges for metal catalysts even at the ppm level. The sulfur poisoning of single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts and their regeneration is worthy of further study. Herein, sulfur poisoning and self&#8208;recovery are first presented on an industrialized single&#8208;Rh&#8208;site catalyst (Rh1/POPs). A decreased turnover frequency of Rh1/POPs from 4317&#8197;h&#8722;1 to 318&#8197;h&#8722;1 was observed in a 1000&#8197;ppm H2S co&#8208;feed for ethylene hydroformylation, but it self&#8208;recovered to 4527&#8197;h&#8722;1 after withdrawal of H2S, whereas the rhodium nanoparticles demonstrated poor activity and self&#8208;recovery ability. H2S reduced the charge density of the single Rh atom and lowered its Gibbs free energy with the formation of inactive (SH)Rh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2, which could be regenerated to active HRh(CO)(PPh3&#8208;frame)2 after withdrawing H2S. The mechanism and the sulfur&#8208;related structure&#8211;activity relationship were highlighted. This work provides an understanding of heterogeneous ethylene hydroformylation and sulfur&#8208;poisoned regeneration in the science of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Radical Coupling Initiated by Organophosphine Addition to Ynoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining established two electron nucleophilic catalysis of organophosphines with photoredox organocatalysis has allowed the discovery of a mechanistically unusual Giese coupling reaction. In addition to addressing a limitation in traditional photoredox coupling with electron&#8208;poor alkynes these studies demonstrate the viability of reaction designs that merge traditional nucleophilic phosphines organocatalysis and photoredox events.







Abstract
Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8211;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.

         <title>Diazoalkenes: From an Elusive Intermediate to a Stable Substance Class in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Early discoveries of diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) in organic synthesis and the identification of room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes since 2021 are summarized in this Minireview. The synthesis, properties, and reactivity of this novel molecule class are presented, and its use in organic synthesis, main&#8208;group, and transition&#8208;metal chemistry highlighted.







Abstract
Over decades diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) were postulated as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry even though their direct spectroscopic detection proved very challenging. In the 1970/80ies several groups probed their existence mainly indirectly by trapping experiments or directly by matrix&#8208;isolation studies. In 2021, our group and the Severin group reported independently the synthesis and characterization of the first room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes, which initiated a rapidly expanding research field. Up to now four different classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic substituted room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes have been reported. Their properties and unique reactivity, such as N2/CO exchange or utilization as vinylidene precursors in organic and transition metal chemistry are presented. This review summarizes the early discoveries of diazoalkenes from their initial postulation as transient, elusive species up to the recent findings of the room&#8208;temperature stable derivatives.

         <title>Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Pro&#8208;nanomodulators for Deep&#8208;Tissue Sono&#8208;immunotherapy of Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulator is developed for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Upon ultrasound activation, the polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulator generates singlet oxygen to cause immunogenic cell death and unleash immunomodulators for promoting antitumor immunity, leading to elimination of progression and metastasis of orthotopic pancreatic tumors, and alleviation of immune&#8208;related adverse events.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has provided a promising modality for cancer treatment, while it often has the issues of limited response rates and potential off&#8208;target side effects in clinical practice. We herein report the construction of semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulators (SPpMs) with ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated activatable pharmacological actions for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Such SPpMs consist of a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer backbone grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) chains linked with two immunomodulators (a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 blocker and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase inhibitor) via a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable segment. In view of the excellent sonodynamic property of the semiconducting polymer core, SPpMs enable effective generation of 1O2 under US treatment, even in a deep&#8208;tissue depth up to 12&#8197;cm. The generated 1O2 not only ablates tumors via a sonodynamic effect and induces immunogenic cell death, but also destroys the 1O2&#8208;cleavable segments to allow in situ release of immunomodulators in tumors. This synergetic action results in boosted antitumor immune response via reversing two tumor immunosuppressive pathways. As such, SPpMs mediate deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy to completely eradicate orthotopic pancreatic cancer and effectively prevent tumor metastasis. Moreover, such an immune activation reduces the possibility of immune&#8208;related adverse events. This study thus provides a smart activatable nanoplatform for precise immunotherapy of deep&#8208;seated tumors.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation of Polyesters to Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new upcycling strategies to address the threats from waste plastics can significantly improve global sustainability. An atom economic reaction was demonstrated to convert polyesters into diols with great selectivity over a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. The reaction could be operated in solvent&#8208;free mode with all atoms in the reactants fixed into the final product, eliminating the need for a separation process.







Abstract
The utilization of carbon resources stored in plastic polymers through chemical recycling and upcycling is a promising approach for mitigating plastic waste. However, most current methods for upcycling suffer from limited selectivity towards a specific valuable product, particularly when attempting full conversion of the plastic. We present a highly selective reaction route for transforming polylactic acid (PLA) into 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilizing a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. This reaction exhibits excellent reactivity (0.65&#8197;g&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99.5&#8201;%) towards 1,2&#8208;propanediol, and most importantly, can be performed in a solvent&#8208;free mode. Significantly, the overall solvent&#8208;free reaction is an atom&#8208;economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H2) fixed into the final product (1,2&#8208;propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high&#8208;purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.

         <title>Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement of Diaryliodonium Salts in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iodonium Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement featuring an aryl transfer from I to C pathway was developed, where no metal&#8208; or photo&#8208;catalysts are needed. The interaction between ionic liquids and diaryliodonium salts largely contributed to the efficiency of the reaction under mild conditions. This method furnished 64&#8197;examples of sulfonyl substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as potentially valuable building blocks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is an intramolecular SNAr reaction, enabling the formation of a new arene carbon&#8208;carbon bond with sufficiently strong carbon&#8208;centered nucleophile. Reported here are ortho&#8208;tosylmethylene functionalized diaryliodonium salts, which can undergo an unprecedented Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement in ionic liquids, resulting in sulfonyl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;iodo diarylmethanes as a powerful class of building blocks in chemical synthesis. The protocol features aryliodo moiety as a hyper nucleofuge, facilitating the formation of Meisenheimer complex within the migratory system.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Benzothiazine 1&#8208;Imines via RuII/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Cyclization</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization of sulfondiimines with sulfoxonium ylides using a RuII catalyst and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, thus expanding the accessible chemical space of chiral hexavalent organosulfur scaffolds relevant to biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8722;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;photoluminescent (PL) CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). The MSCs evolve from their counterpart precursor compounds (PCs), which are relatively transparent in optical absorption. The non&#8208;absorbing PCs assist the transformation of the absorbing MSCs. Monomer substitution is involved in the PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization, and monomer addition in the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation.







Abstract
Colloidal semiconductor II&#8211;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at &#8776;322&#8197;nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373&#8197;nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.

         <title>Carrier Protein Mediated Formation of the Dihydropyridazinone Ring in Actinopyridazinone Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actinopyridazinone biosynthesis represents a unique biochemical transformation of an amino acid. It involves N&#947;&#8208;amination of DABA using alanine as a nitrogen donor. An acetyl hydrazone intermediate undergoes an unprecedented carrier protein mediated heterocyclization to give a dihydropyridazinone. This is a sophisticated biosynthetic strategy in which an acetylation temporarily protects the reactive hydrazone during biosynthesis.







Abstract
Heterocycles with nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen (N&#8722;N) bonds are privileged building blocks of synthetic drugs. They are also found in natural products, although the biosynthetic logic behind them is poorly understood. Actinopyridazinones produced by Streptomyces sp. MSD090630SC&#8208;05 possess unique dihydropyridazinone rings that have been studied as core nuclei in several approved synthetic therapeutics. Herein, we performed gene knockouts and in vitro biochemical experiments to elucidate the major steps in actinopyridazinone biosynthesis, including the unprecedented carrier protein mediated machinery for dihydropyridazinone formation.

         <title>Linking Composition, Structure and Thickness of CoOOH layers to Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity by Correlative Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our correlative multimodal approach can link local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, morphology and composition of surface species formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that a 6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) layer, grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, contains more hydroxyl ions and easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites, exhibiting a higher OER activity than 3&#8197;nm thick &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) formed on [02
&#8208;oriented Co.







Abstract
The role of &#946;&#8208;CoOOH crystallographic orientations in catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains elusive. We combine correlative electron backscatter diffraction/scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to establish the structure&#8211;activity relationships of various faceted &#946;&#8208;CoOOH formed on a Co microelectrode under OER conditions. We reveal that &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0), grown on [
0]&#8208;oriented Co, exhibits higher OER activity than &#8776;3&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(10
3) or &#8776;6&#8197;nm &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(0006) formed on [02
&#8208; and [0001]&#8208;oriented Co, respectively. This arises from higher amounts of incorporated hydroxyl ions and more easily reducible CoIII&#8722;O sites present in &#946;&#8208;CoOOH(01
0) than those in the latter two oxyhydroxide facets. Our correlative multimodal approach shows great promise in linking local activity with atomic&#8208;scale details of structure, thickness and composition of active species, which opens opportunities to design pre&#8208;catalysts with preferred defects that promote the formation of the most active OER species.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver&#8211;acetylene interactions adopting a heteroleptic ternary coordination mode enabled the synthesis of concave polyhedral cages upon anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;triggered interconversion of highly entangled polyhedra. In their Communication (e202303714), Yuya Domoto and co&#8208;workers describe skeletally edited 3D architectures having partially disconnected knot or link motifs at their polyhedral faces.

         <title>Stepwise O2&#8208;Induced Rearrangement and Disassembly of the [NiFe4(OH)(&#181;3&#8208;S)4] Active Site Cluster of CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. CODHs are found in anaerobic microorganisms and can rapidly lose their activity when exposed to air. What causes the loss of activity is unclear. Here, we analyzed the time&#8208;dependent structural changes induced by the presence of air on the metal centers of CODH&#8208;II. We show that inactivation is a multistep process. In a reversible step, the open coordination site on the Ni ion is blocked by a Ni,Fe&#8208;bridging &#181;&#8208;sulfido or chlorido ligand. Blocking this open coordination site with a cyanide ligand stabilizes the cluster against O2&#8208;induced decomposition, indicating that O2 attacks at the Ni ion. In the subsequent irreversible phase, nickel is lost, the Fe ions rearrange and the sulfido ligands disappear. Our data are consistent with a reversible reductive reactivation mechanism to protect CODHs from transient over&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrode/Electrolyte Synergy for Concerted Promotion of Electron and Proton Transfers toward Efficient Neutral Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half&#8208;reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH&#8208;benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment via hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neutral water oxidation is a crucial half-reaction for various electrochemical applications requiring pH-benign conditions. However, its sluggish kinetics with limited proton and electron transfer rates greatly impacts the overall energy efficiency. In this work, we created an electrode/electrolyte synergy strategy for simultaneously enhancing the proton and electron transfers at the interface toward highly efficient neutral water oxidation. The charge transfer was accelerated between the iridium oxide and in situ formed nickel oxyhydroxide on the electrode end. The proton transfer was expedited by the compact borate environment via hierarchical fluoride/borate anions on the electrolyte end. These concerted promotions facilitated the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) events. Upon the electrode/electrolyte synergy, Ir-O and Ir-OO- intermediates could be directly detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the rate-limiting step of Ir-O oxidation was determined. This synergy strategy can extend the scope of optimizing electrocatalytic activities toward more electrode/electrolyte combinations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) have aroused great interest globally with their unique electrochemical, catalytic, and mechanical properties, as well as diverse activity and multielement tunability for multi&#8208;step reactions. Herein, a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis method at atmospheric pressure is employed to synthesize Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell NPs with a single phase of face&#8208;centred cubic structure for promoting the oxidation of C1 and C2 alcohols. Interestingly, the lattice of both Pd&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;core and Pt&#8208;enriched&#8208;HEA&#8208;shell enlarge during the formation process of HEA, with tensile strains included in the core and shell of HEA. Strikingly, the as&#8208;made PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs show excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Especially, the specific (mass) activity of PdAgSn/PtBi HEA NPs for MOR is 4.7 mA/cm2 (2874 mA mg(Pd+Pt)&#8208;1), about 1.7 (5.9) and 1.5 (4.8) times higher than that of commercial Pd/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Combined with high&#8208;entropy effect, Pt sites and Pd sites on the interface of the HEA act synergistically to facilitate the multi&#8208;step process towards EOR. This study offers a promising way to find a feasible route for scalable HEA manufacturing with promising applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure and Metal&#8208;confining Carbon Nanotubes through Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide in Ca&#8208;based Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To be successfully implemented, an efficient conversion, affordable operation and high values of CO2&#8208;derived products by electrochemical conversion of CO2 are yet to be addressed. Inspired by the natural CaO&#8211;CaCO3 cycle, we herein introduce CaO into electrolysis of SnO2 in affordable molten CaCl2&#8211;NaCl to establish an in situ capture and conversion of CO2. In situ capture of anodic CO2 from graphite anode by the added CaO generates CaCO3. The consequent co&#8208;electrolysis of SnO2 and CaCO3 confines Sn in carbon nanotube (Sn@CNT) in cathode and increases current efficiency of O2 evolution in graphite anode to 71.9%. The intermediated CaC2 is verified as the nuclei to direct a self&#8208;template generation of CNT, ensuring a CO2&#8211;CNT current efficiency and energy efficiency of 85.1% and 44.8%, respectively. The Sn@CNT integrates confined responses of Sn cores to external electrochemical or thermal stimuli with robust CNT sheaths, resulting in excellent Li storage performance and intriguing application as nanothermometer. The versatility of the molten salt electrolysis of CO2 in Ca&#8208;based molten salts for template&#8208;free generation of advanced carbon materials is evidenced by the successful generation of pure CNT, Zn@CNT and Fe@CNT.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable van der Waals Heterostructures through Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method is demonstrated for the preparation of high&#8208;quality van der Waals heterostructures in solution through an electrochemical strategy. The produced van der Waals heterostructures exhibit strong interlayer coupling, extraordinary structural integrity, large lateral dimension and good optoelectronic properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (2D vdWHs) have recently gained widespread attention because of their abundant and exotic properties, which open up many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, practical applications remain challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput techniques for fabricating high&#8208;quality vdWHs. Here, we demonstrate a general electrochemical strategy to prepare solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;quality vdWHs, in which electrostatic forces drive the stacking of electrochemically exfoliated individual assemblies with intact structures and clean interfaces into vdWHs with strong interlayer interactions. Thanks to the excellent combination of strong light absorption, interfacial charge transfer, and decent charge transport properties in individual layers, thin&#8208;film photodetectors based on graphene/In2Se3 vdWHs exhibit great promise for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection, owing to a high responsivity (267&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1), fast rise (72&#8197;ms) and decay (426&#8197;ms) times under NIR illumination. This approach enables various hybrid systems, including graphene/In2Se3, graphene/MoS2 and graphene/MoSe2 vdWHs, providing a broad avenue for exploring emerging electronic, photonic, and exotic quantum phenomena.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems in view of the high theoretical energy density and low cost of sulfur resources. The suppression of polysulfide diffusion and promotion of redox kinetics are the main challenges for Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we design and prepare a novel type of ZnCo&#8208;based bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework nanoboxes (ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs) to serve as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The hollow architecture of ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can ensure fast charge transfer, improved sulfur utilization, and effective confinement of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The atomically dispersed Co&#8208;O4 sites in ZnCo&#8208;MOF NBs can firmly capture LiPSs and electrocatalytically accelerate their conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple structural advantages, the ZnCo&#8208;MOF/S cathode shows high reversible capacity, impressive rate performance, and superior cycling stability for 300 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Framework&#8208;Hotspot Enhanced Trans Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Clinical Samples Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trans&#8208;cleavage property of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system makes it an excellent tool for disease diagnosis. Nevertheless, most methods based on CRISPR&#8208;Cas system still require pre&#8208;amplification of the target to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. Here we generate Framework&#8208;Hotspot reporters (FHRs) with different local densities to investigate their effect on trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a. We find that the cleavage efficiency increases and the cleavage rate accelerates with increasing reporter density. We further construct a modular sensing platform with CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based target recognition and FHR&#8208;based signal transduction. Encouragingly, this modular platform enables sensitive (100 fM) and rapid (&lt;15 min) detection of pathogen nucleic acids without pre&#8208;amplification, as well as detection of tumor protein markers in clinical samples. The design provides a facile strategy for enhanced trans cleavage of Cas12a, which accelerates and broadens its applications in biosensing.</dc:description>

However, current affinity purification methods are very cost intensive, and this imposes limits on versatile use of affinity purification for obtaining purified proteins for a variety of applications. To overcome this problem, we developed a new affinity purification system which we call CSAP (chitin&#8208; and streptavidin&#8208;mediated affinity purification) for low&#8208;cost purification of Strep&#8208;tag II fusion proteins. The CSAP system is designed to utilize commercially available chitin powder as a chromatography matrix, thereby significantly improving the cost&#8208;efficiency of protein affinity purification. We investigated the CSAP system for protein screening in 96&#8208;well format as a demonstration. Through the screening of 96 types of purified hemoproteins, several proteins capable of the catalytic diastereo&#8208;divergent synthesis of cyclopropanes were identified as candidates for an abiotic carbene transfer reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced Drug Release for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug delivery systems (DDSs) are designed to deliver therapeutic agents to specific target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Recent developments in drug&#8208;loaded DDSs have demonstrated promising characteristics and paved new pathways for cancer treatment. Light, a prevalent external stimulus, is widely utilized to trigger drug release. However, conventional light sources primarily concentrate on the ultraviolet (UV) and visible light regions, which suffer from limited biological tissue penetration. This limitation hinders applications for deep&#8208;tissue tumor drug release. Given their deep tissue penetration and well&#8208;established application technology, X&#8208;rays have recently received attention for the pursuit of controlled drug release. With precise spatiotemporal and dosage controllability, X&#8208;rays stand as an ideal stimulus for achieving controlled drug release in deep&#8208;tissue cancer therapy. This article explores the recent advancements in using X&#8208;rays for stimulus&#8208;triggered drug release in DDSs and delves into their action mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable Biomass Battery for Electricity Storage/generation and Concurrent Valuable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a rechargeable battery that can produce valuable chemicals in both electricity storage and generation processes hold great promise for increasing the electron economy and economic value. However, this battery has yet to be explored. Herein, we report a biomass flow battery that generates electricity while producing furoic acid, and store electricity while yielding furfuryl alcohol. The battery is composed of a rhodium&#8208;copper (Rh1Cu) single&#8208;atom alloy as anode, a cobalt&#8208;doped nickel hydroxide (Co0.2Ni0.8(OH)2) as cathode, and furfural&#8208;containing anolyte. In a full battery evaluation, this battery displays an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.29 V and a peak power density up to 107 mW cm&#8211;2, surpassing most catalysis&#8208;battery hybrid systems. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that this battery produces 1 kg furoic acid with 0.78 kWh electricity output, and yields 0.62 kg furfuryl alcohol when 1 kWh electricity is stored. This work may shed light on the design of rechargeable battery with value&#8208;added functionality such as chemicals production.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum/Copper Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Vinylogous Addition Reactions for the Synthesis of Functionalized Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of multicomponent ligands to improve catalytic reactivity and selectivity remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of chiral building blocks. Here, a modular synthesis of structurally diverse multiligated platinum complexes, characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, was revealed to open up a previously inaccessible reaction space. A library of more than 16 binary component&#8208;ligated platinum complexes was identified as a practical toolkit to enable faster screening. The isolated bench&#8208;stable Pt(II)(oxazoline)(phosphine) complex paired with a chiral copper complex exhibits fundamentally new cooperative reactivity. The newly designed Pt/Cu dual catalytic system contributed to the development of highly enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions between a Pt&#8208;activated electrophilic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbene and a Cu&#8208;activated nucleophile, resulting in a reliable process for the asymmetric synthesis of valuable functionalized indoles in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Glycosyl radical functionalization is one of the central topics in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. Recent advances in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling chemistry and metallaphotoredox catalysis provided powerful platforms for glycosyl radical diversification. In particular, the discovery of new glycosyl radical precursors in conjunction with these advanced reaction technologies have significantly expanded the space for glycosyl compound synthesis. In this Minireview, we highlight the most recent progress in this area starting from 2021, and the reports included will be categorized based on different reaction types for better clarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocarbon Oxidation by a Porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Cation Radical Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heme and chlorin &#960;&#8208;cation radical oxidants are widely implicated in biological and synthetic oxidation catalysis. Little insight into the role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals in proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation is available. We prepared a NiII&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation complex ([NiII(P&#8226;+)]) and found it to be capable of the oxidation of a variety of simple hydrocarbon substrates. Interestingly, some of the products were hydroxylated, with ([NiII(P&#8226;+)]) working in concert with atmospheric O2 to yield hydroxylated hydrocarbons. Kinetic data suggested that the porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical species oxidised substrates via a concerted PCET mechanism, where the nickel porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation radical accepted the electron, and the proton was transferred to a free anion. Our findings highlight the potential role of &#960;&#8208;cation radicals as hydrocarbon activators, demonstrating that porphyrin ligand non&#8208;innocence could be a readily manipulated resource for oxidation catalyst development.</dc:description>

         <title>Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization and Fluorogenic Labeling of RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific introduction of bioorthogonal handles into RNAs is in high demand for decorating RNAs with fluorophores, affinity labels or other modifications. Aldehydes represent attractive functional groups for post&#8208;synthetic bioconjugation reactions. Here, we report a ribozyme&#8208;based method for the synthesis of aldehyde&#8208;functionalized RNA by directly converting a purine nucleobase. Using the methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 as an alkyltransferase, the reaction is initiated by site&#8208;specific N1 benzylation of purine, followed by nucleophilic ring opening and spontaneous hydrolysis under mild conditions to yield a 5&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;formylimidazole residue in good yields. The modified nucleotide is accessible to aldehyde&#8208;reactive probes, as demonstrated by the conjugation of biotin or fluorescent dyes to short synthetic RNAs and full&#8208;length tRNA transcripts. Upon fluorogenic condensation with a 2,3,3&#8208;trimethylindole moiety, a novel hemicyanine chromo&#173;phore was generated directly on the RNA. This work expands the MTR1 ribozyme&#8217;s area of application from a methyltransferase to a tool for site&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage functionalization of RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Organopotassium&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzylsilanes have found increasing applications in organic synthesis as bench&#8208;stable synthetic intermediates, yet are mostly produced by stoichiometric procedures. Catalytic alternatives based on the atom&#8208;economical silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds remain scarcely available as specialized directing groups and catalytic systems are needed to outcompete the kinetically&#8208;favored silylation of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds. Herein, we describe the first general and catalytic&#8208;in&#8208;metal undirected silylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds under ambient, transition metal&#8208;free conditions using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8211;N=N&#8211;SiR3) as silicon source. The high activity and selectivity of the catalytic system, exemplified by the preparation of various mono&#8208; or gem&#8208;bis benzyl(di)silanes, originates from the facile generation of organopotassium reagents, including the tert&#8208;butylpotassium.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(&#8722;)&#8208;Adenophorone (1), a caged polycyclic sesquiterpene featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[4.3.1.05,9]decane skeleton, was isolated from Eupatorium adenopharum Spreng. The structure of 1 was unambiguously established by a combination of spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and bioinspired total synthesis. Key synthetic features include a sequential Reformatsky/oxidation/regio&#8208; and stereoselective hydrogenation, and subsequent merged MBH&#8208;Tsuji&#8208;Trost cyclization. The concise synthetic sequence efficiently constructs the bicyclic skeleton of cadinene sesquiterpene (+)&#8208;euptox A (2) in 8 steps from commercially available monoterpene (&#8722;)&#8208;carvone (6), with outstanding performance on diastereocontrol. The bioinspired synthesis of 1 was achieved from 2, a plausible biogenetic precursor, via transannular Michael addition. This work provides experimental evidence of our proposed biosynthetic hypothesis of 1. Additionally, compound 1 showed potent neuroprotective activity in H2O2&#8208;treated SH&#8208;SY5Y and PC12 cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The pursuit of high metal utilization in heterogeneous catalysis has triggered the burgeoning interest of various atomically dispersed catalysts. Our aim in this review is to assess key recent findings in the synthesis, characterization, structure&#8208;property relationship and computational studies of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), which cover the full spectrum of applications in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In particular, combination of qualitative and quantitative characterization with cooperation with DFT insights, synergies and superiorities of DACs compare to counterparts, high&#8208;throughput catalyst exploration and screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms are highlighted. Undoubtably, it would be wise to expect more fascinating developments in the field of DACs as tunable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Functionalization with Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Disulfide Giving Symmetric and Unsymmetric Hydrazido Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we show that a tridentate bis(aryloxide)anilide&#8208;ligated titanium/potassium scaffold promotes functionalization of coordinated N2 with CO2 and CS2 through formation of N&#8211;C bonds. Treatment of a naphthalene complex with N2 gave an end&#8208;on bridging dinitrogen complex featuring a [Ti2K2N2] core. The dinitrogen complex underwent insertion of CO2 into each Ti&#8211;NN bond to afford an N,N&#8217;dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. Stepwise nitrogen&#8211;carbon bond formation at coordinated N2 proceeded to afford an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating the dinitrogen complex with CS2 and CO2. Addition of Me3SiCl to the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex resulted in partial silylation of the carboxylate groups but did not lead to removal of the functionalized N2 unit from the metal centers. However, reduction of the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex with potassium naphthalenide afforded an oxo&#8208;bridged dinuclear complex along with release of free potassium cyanate.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation of Type III to Type II Porous Liquids by Tuning Surface Rigidity of Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra for CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquids (PLs), a summation of porous hosts and bulky solvents bestowing permanent cavities, are the prominent emerging materials. Despite great efforts, exploration of porous hosts and bulky solvents is still needed to develop new PL systems. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with discrete molecular architectures can be considered as porous hosts; however, many of them are insoluble entities. Here we report the transformation of type III PL to type II PLs by tuning the surface rigidity of insoluble MOP, Rh24L24, in a bulky ionic liquid (IL). Functionalization of N&#8208;donor molecules on Rh&#8208;Rh axial sites ensue their solubilization in bulky IL which confer type II PLs. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal the bulkiness of IL as per the cage apertures, and the cause of their dissolution as well. The obtained PLs, capturing more CO2 than neat solvent, have depicted higher catalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition compared to individual MOPs and IL.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Redox Molecular Junctions in Covalent Organic Frameworks for H2O2 Photosynthesis Coupled with Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass&#8208;valorization can not only maximize the energy utilization but also realize the production of value&#8208;added products. Here, a series of COFs (i.e. Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF and TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with regulated redox molecular junctions have been prepared to study the H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with furfuryl alcohol (FFA) photo&#8208;oxidation to furoic acid (FA). Best of them, the FA generation&#8208;efficiency of Cu3&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can be 575 mM g&#8208;1 (conv. ~100% and sele. &gt;99%) and meanwhile the H2O2 production&#8208;rate can reach up to 187,000 &#956;M g&#8208;1, much higher than Cu3&#8208;pT&#8208;COF, TFP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF and its monomers. As proved by theoretical calculations, the covalent coupling of Cu cluster and thiazole group can promote the charge&#8208;transfer, substrate&#8208;activation and FFA&#8208;dehydrogenation, thus boosting the both kinetics of H2O2 production and FFA photo&#8208;oxidation to increase the efficiency. This is the first work about COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis coupled with biomass&#8208;valorization, which might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline&#8208;catalysts in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) Imaging of Individual Vesicles to Investigate the Relation between Fraction of Chemical Release and Vesicle Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging were used to measure vesicle size and vesicular isotopic dopamine content in cellular vesicles. Measurements before and after stimulated exocytotic release show the fraction of chemical release is independent of vesicle size.







Abstract
We used correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging to quantify the contents of subvesicular compartments, and to measure the partial release fraction of 13C&#8208;dopamine in cellular nanovesicles as a function of size. Three modes of exocytosis comprise full release, kiss&#8208;and&#8208;run, and partial release. The latter has been subject to scientific debate, despite a growing amount of supporting literature. We tailored culturing procedures to alter vesicle size and definitively show no size correlation with the fraction of partial release. In NanoSIMS images, vesicle content was indicated by the presence of isotopic dopamine, while vesicles which underwent partial release were identified by the presence of an 127I&#8208;labelled drug, to which they were exposed during exocytosis allowing entry into the open vesicle prior to its closing again. Demonstration of similar partial release fractions indicates that this mode of exocytosis is predominant across a wide range of vesicle sizes.

         <title>Merging Boron and Carbonyl based MR&#8208;TADF Emitter Designs to Achieve High Performance Pure Blue OLEDs
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter, DOBDiKTa merges the motifs of boron&#8208;based and ketone&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Using this molecular design, this compound shows deep blue, narrowband emission. The co&#8208;host device with DOBDiKTa achieved a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;% and blue emission with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12).







Abstract
Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds are attractive as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) as they can simultaneously harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light in the device and show very narrow emission spectra, which translates to excellent color purity. Here, we report the first example of an MR&#8208;TADF emitter (DOBDiKTa) that fuses together fragments from the two major classes of MR&#8208;TADF compounds, those containing boron (DOBNA) and those containing carbonyl groups (DiKTa) as acceptor fragments in the MR&#8208;TADF skeleton. The resulting molecular design, this compound shows desirable narrowband pure blue emission and efficient TADF character. The co&#8208;host OLED with DOBDiKTa as the emitter showed a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 17.4&#8201;%, an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 32&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12). Compared to DOBNA and DiKTa, DOBDiKTa shows higher device efficiency with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off while maintaining a high color purity, which demonstrates the promise of the proposed molecular design.

         <title>Free Amino Group Transfer via &#945;&#8208;Amination of Native Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino group transfer strategy was developed to install free NH2 to the &#945;&#8208;position of native carbonyls under mild conditions. The resulting primary &#945;&#8208;aminated products are amenable to in situ peptide coupling or Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization in one&#8208;pot procedures. We anticipate this method to provide a general platform towards the synthesis of amines, ultimately opening exciting avenues in the synthesis and medicinal study of peptidomimetics.







Abstract
We report herein a straightforward transfer of a free amino group (NH2) from a commercially available nitrogen source to unfunctionalized, native carbonyls (amides and ketones) resulting in direct &#945;&#8208;amination. Primary &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyls are readily produced under mild conditions, further enabling diverse in situ functionalization reactions&#8212;including peptide coupling and Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization&#8212;that capitalize on the presence of the unprotected primary amine.

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanorings: Synthesis, Properties and Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Ternary Complexes Featuring a Narcissistic Chiral Self&#8208;Recognition for Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral carbon nanorings with excellent photophysical and chiroptical properties have been synthesized. Importantly, Chiral ternary complexes, consisted of chiral carbon nanorings, 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and protonated chiral amines, display excellent narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognitions for protonated chiral amines.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and chiroptical properties of novel chiral carbon nanorings Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP containing a planar chiral [2.2]PCP unit, and demonstrate that Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP can not only host crown ether 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring complexes with a binding constant 3.35&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, but also accommodate the complexes of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and S/R&#8208;protonated amines to form homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; and heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ternary complexes, displaying significantly larger binding constants of up to 3.31&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 depending on the chiral guests. Importantly, homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes exhibit an enhanced CD signal, while the heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ones have a constant CD signal compared with the chiral carbon nanorings, respectively, which suggests that homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes display a highly narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for S/R&#8208;protonated chiral amines, respectively. Finally, the chiral ternary complexes can be further applied to determine the ee values of chiral guests. The findings highlight a new application of carbon nanorings in supramolecular sensors, beyond the common recognition of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Diarylmethylamines by Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8208;H Alkoxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMAs) via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation was reported. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.







Abstract
Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.

         <title>Guiding Principles for the Rational Design of Hybrid Materials: Use of DFT Methodology for Evaluating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in a Uranyl Tetrahalide Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl tetrahalide supramolecular systems are investigated using both experiment and Density Functional Theory. We intend to investigate the effect that hydrogen bonding may have on the formation enthalpies of these systems. Here, we demonstrate that an expanded network of hydrogen bonds can stabilize supramolecular complexes and directly affect their formation enthalpies.







Abstract
Together with the synthesis and experimental characterization of 14 hybrid materials containing [UO2X4]2&#8722; (X=Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;) and organic cations, we report on novel methods for determining correlation trends in their formation enthalpy (&#916;Hf) and observed vibrational signatures. &#916;Hf values were analyzed through isothermal acid calorimetry and a Density Functional Theory+Thermodynamics (DFT+T) approach with results showing good agreement between theory and experiment. Three factors (packing efficiency, cation protonation enthalpy, and hydrogen bonding energy [
]) were assessed as descriptors for trends in &#916;Hf. Results demonstrated a strong correlation between 
 and &#916;Hf, highlighting the importance of hydrogen bonding networks in determining the relative stability of solid&#8208;state hybrid materials. Lastly, we investigate how hydrogen bonding networks affect the vibrational characteristics of uranyl solid&#8208;state materials using experimental Raman and IR spectroscopy and theoretical bond orders and find that hydrogen bonding can red&#8208;shift U&#8801;O stretching modes. Overall, the tightly integrated experimental and theoretical studies presented here bridge the trends in macroscopic thermodynamic energies and spectroscopic features with molecular&#8208;level details of the geometry and electronic structure. This modeling framework forms a basis for exploring 3D hydrogen bonding as a tunable design feature in the pursuit of supramolecular materials by rational design.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic NO Oxidation with Simultaneous Nitrate Storage Using A Flow Photoanode Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr)/nickel foam with abundant mesoporous pores can enable the progressive conversion of NO into nitrate without releasing remarkable NO2 by refining the reactive oxygen species to &#8901;OH and achieve the simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants through a flow photoanode reactor. This study can provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy for NO removal and sustainable nitrate storage.







Abstract
The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low&#8208;toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study demonstrates that this bottleneck can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS) on Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66(Zr) (Ni@NU) using nickel foam (NF) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas&#8208;phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8901;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82&#8201;% of NO without releasing remarkable NO2 under a low bias voltage (0.3&#8197;V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99&#8201;% for long&#8208;term use. Through calculation, 90&#8201;% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NOx control.

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer vesicles deform their shape gradually as every breath they take. SO2 gas reacting with the cyanine species in polymersomes can drive a continuous 1D stretching motion of membranes that transform them to tubesomes. Such a membrane plastic deformation process can be programmed by SO2 level, which will well regulate the membrane permselectivity to realize transmembrane traffic management towards cargos of different size.







Abstract
Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.

         <title>Influence of the Time Scale on the Reaction Mechanism of CO Oxidation over a Au/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (FTIR) cell for rapid concentration modulation and applied it to study the reaction pathway of CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 at different time scales. We found that the reaction time could influence the reaction pathway. Multiple reaction mechanisms can be present under the same reaction conditions. At long reaction times, electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) play an important role.







Abstract
Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc., whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds, CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds, the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.

         <title>The Formation of NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+, Yb3+ Nanocrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;ray Scattering: Phase Transition and Size Focusing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles was followed using in situ X&#8208;ray scattering. The experiments reveal the kinetics of particle growth (small&#8208;angle scattering) and phase transformation (wide&#8208;angle scattering). A surprising particle size evolution is observed, where &#945;&#8208;phase particles develop a bimodal size distribution before they transform into &#946;&#8208;phase.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals are a popular class of optical materials. They can be doped with optically active lanthanide ions and shaped into core&#8208;multi&#8208;shell geometries with controlled dopant distributions. Here, we follow the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;NaYF4 nanocrystals from &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles using in situ small&#8208;angle and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ex situ electron microscopy. We observe an evolution from a unimodal particle size distribution to bimodal, and eventually back to unimodal. The final size distribution is narrower in absolute numbers than the initial distribution. These peculiar growth dynamics happen in large part before the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#946; phase transformation. We propose that the splitting of the size distribution is caused by variations in the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;NaYF4 precursor particles, potentially due to inter&#8208;particle differences in stoichiometry. Rate equation modeling confirms that a continuous distribution of reactivities can result in the observed particle growth dynamics.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydrative Aldol Reaction (HAR) via Vinyl&#8208;Gold Promoted Intermolecular Ynamide Addition to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported an intermolecular asymmetric hydrative aldol reaction through vinyl&#8208;gold intermediate under ambient conditions. This tandem alkyne hydration and sequential nucleophilic addition afforded a &#8216;base&#8208;free&#8217; approach to b&#8208;hydroxy amides with high efficiency (up to 95% yields, &gt;50 examples). Vinyl gold intermediate was applied as reactive nucleophile and Fe(acac)3 was used as the critical co&#8208;catalyst to prevent undesired protodeauration, allowing this transformation to proceed under mild conditions with good functional group tolerance and excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 d.r. and up to 99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Illisimonin A and Merrilactone A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Illicium sesquiterpenes are a large number of biologically active secondary metabolites which are isolated from Illicium species of plants and well known for their activity of neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Compared to various studies of bioactivity and synthesis of the illicium sesquiterpenes, there are very few discussions in their biosynthetic pathways. Herein, we report a plausible comprehensive biosynthetic pathway of illicium sesquiterpenes and a synthetic route to illisimonin A and merrilactone A based on it. We think that most of the illicium sesquiterpenes&#8217; carbon scaffolds could be synthesized from dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane via retro&#8208;Dieckmann condensation, oxidative cleavage and aldol reaction at suitable oxidation states in Nature. The common intermediate for illisimonin A and merrilactone A similar to the dicarbonyl derivative of allo&#8208;cedrane was assembled by an intramolecular desymmetrizing reductive Heck reaction. A new type of chiral phosphine ligands was developed to achieve the asymmetric intramolecular desymmetrizing reductive Heck reaction, and a maximum of 82% ee was obtained. The syntheses of illisimonin A and merrilactone A confirmed the key transformations of the proposed biosynthetic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Cesium Methylammonium Lead Iodide (CsxMA1&#8208;xPbI3) Nanocrystals with Wide Range Cation Composition Tuning and Enhanced Thermal Stability of the Perovskite Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium methylammonium lead iodide (CsxMA1&#8208;xPbI3) nanocrystals were obtained with a wide range of A&#8208;site Cs&#8208;MA compositions by post&#8208;synthetic, room temperature cation exchange between CsPbI3 nanocrystals and MAPbI3 nanocrystals. The alloyed CsxMA1&#8208;xPbI3 nanocrystals retain their photoactive perovskite phase with incorporated Cs content, x, as high as 0.74 and the expected composition&#8208;tunable photoluminescence (PL). Excess methylammonium oleate from the reaction mixture in the MAPbI3 nanocrystal dispersions was necessary to obtain fast Cs&#8208;MA cation exchange. The phase transformation and degradation kinetics of films of CsxMA1&#8208;xPbI3 nanocrystals were measured and modeled using an Avrami expression. The transformation kinetics were significantly slower than those of the parent CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 nanocrystals, with Avrami rate constants, k, at least an order of magnitude smaller. These results affirm that A&#8208;site cation alloying is a promising strategy for stabilizing iodide&#8208;based perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Enantiomeric Stereogenic Sulfur&#8208;Chiral Organic Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral ferroelectric crystals with intriguing features have attracted great interest and many with point or axial chirality based on the stereocarbon have been successively developed in recent years. However, ferroelectric crystals with stereogenic heteroatomic chirality have never been documented so far. Here, we discover and report a pair of enantiomeric stereogenic sulfur&#8208;chiral single&#8208;component organic ferroelectric crystals, Rs&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (Rs&#8208;tBuSA) and Ss&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfinamide (Ss&#8208;tBuSA) through the deep understanding of the chemical design of molecular ferroelectric crystals. Both enantiomers adopt chiral&#8208;polar point group 2 (C2) and exhibit mirror&#8208;image relationships. They undergo high&#8208;temperature 432F2&#8208;type plastic ferroelectric phase transition around 348 K. The ferroelectricity has been well confirmed by ferroelectric hysteresis loops and domains. Polarized light microscopy records the evolution of the ferroelastic domains, according with the fact that the 432F2&#8208;type phase transition is both ferroelectric and ferroelastic. The very soft characteristics with low elastic modulus and hardness reveals their excellent mechanical flexibility. This finding indicates the first stereosulfur chiral molecular ferroelectric crystals, opening up new fertile ground for exploring molecular ferroelectric crystals with great application prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Processing of Unsubstituted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Aromatic Polymers through Water&#8208;solubilization Using Aromatic Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated aromatic polymers (&#960;CAPs) are central components of functional materials yet suffer from insolubility without multiple covalent substituents on their backbones. We herein disclose a new strategy for the facile processing of unsubstituted heterocyclic &#960;CAPs (i.e., poly(para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;benzobisoxazole) and poly(benzimidazobenzo&#8208;phenanthroline)), independent of the polymer length, via non&#8208;covalent encircling with aromatic micelles, composed of bent aromatic amphiphiles, in water. The UV&#8208;visible studies reveal that the efficiencies of the present encircling method are ~10 to 50&#8208;fold higher than those using conventional amphiphiles under the same conditions. The AFM and SEM analyses of the resultant aqueous polymer composites show that otherwise insoluble &#960;CAPs form fine bundles (e.g., ~1 nm in thickness) in the tubular aromatic micelles, through efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. In the same way, pristine poly(para&#8208;phenylene) can be dissolved in water, displaying enhanced fluorescence (10&#8208;fold), relative to the polymer solid. Two types of unsubstituted &#960;CAPs are likewise co&#8208;encircled in water, indicated by UV&#8208;visible analysis. Importantly, aqueous processing of the encircled &#960;CAPs into free&#8208;standing single&#8208; or multicomponent films with submicrometer thickness is demonstrated through a simple filtration&#8208;annealing protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>A pro&#8208;Fluorescent Ubiquitin&#8208;based Probe to Monitor Cysteine&#8208;based E3 Ligase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein post&#8208;translational modification with ubiquitin (Ub) is a versatile signal regulating almost all aspects of cell biology, and an increasing range of diseases is associated with impaired Ub modification. In this light, the Ub system offers an attractive, yet underexplored route to the development of novel targeted treatments. A promising strategy for small molecule intervention is posed by the final components of the enzymatic ubiquitination cascade, E3 ligases, as they determine the specificity of the protein ubiquitination pathway. Here, we present UbSRhodol, an autoimmolative Ub&#8208;based probe, which upon E3 processing liberates the pro&#8208;fluorescent dye, amenable to profile the E3 transthiolation activity for recombinant and in cell&#8208;extract E3 ligases. UbSRhodol enabled detection of changes in transthiolation efficacy evoked by enzyme key point mutations or conformational changes, and offers an excellent assay reagent amenable to a high&#8208;throughput screening setup allowing the identification of small molecules modulating E3 activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Solid&#8208;State NMR with Structural and Biophysical Techniques to Design Challenging Protein&#8208;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several protein&#8208;drug conjugates are currently being used in cancer therapy. These conjugates rely on cytotoxic organic compounds that are covalently attached to the carrier proteins or that interact with them via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Human transthyretin (TTR), a physiological protein, has already been identified as a possible carrier protein for the delivery of cytotoxic drugs. Here we show the structure&#8208;guided development of a new stable cytotoxic molecule based on a known strong binder of TTR and a well&#8208;established anticancer drug. This example is used to demonstrate the importance of the integration of multiple biophysical and structural techniques, encompassing MST, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. In particular, we show that solid&#8208;state NMR has the ability to reveal effects caused by ligand binding which are more easily relatable to structural and dynamical alterations that impact the stability of macromolecular complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Biomimetic Extracellular Matrix for Cell Nanoencapsulation and Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell encapsulation has been studied for various applications ranging from cell transplantation to biological production. However, current encapsulation technologies focus on cell protection rather than cell regulation that is essential to most if not all cell&#8208;based applications. Here we report a method for cell nanoencapsulation and regulation using an ultrathin biomimetic extracellular matrix as a cell nanocapsule to carry nanoparticles (CN2). This method allows high&#8208;capacity nanoparticle retention at the vicinity of cell surface. The encapsulated cells maintain high viability and normal metabolism. When gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as a model to decorate the nanocapsule, light irradiation transiently increases the temperature, leading to the activation of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter and the regulation of reporter gene expression. As the biomimetic nanocapsule can be decorated with any or multiple NPs, CN2 is a promising platform for advancing cell&#8208;based applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Lewis&#8208;Paired CN Groups for Organic p&#8208;Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type chemical doping (p&#8208;doping) is a key technique to modulate optical, electrical, and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. However, typical functional groups in organic p&#8208;dopants have insufficient electron&#8208;withdrawing strength, and inevitable dopant diffusion in host matrices degrades doping stabilities. Herein, we develop extremely electron&#8208;withdrawing Lewis&#8208;paired CN groups as a new class of building blocks for designing unprecedentedly strong organic p&#8208;dopants with excellent doping stability. Various Lewis acids are paired with CN&#8208;functionalized conjugated molecules in the solution state, which strengthens the electron&#8208;withdrawing property of CN groups by almost twofold. The large&#8208;sized dopants facilitate outstanding doping stability against continuous heating and long&#8208;term atmospheric exposure, which is promising for practical applications in devices. Given the broad applicability of this simple combinatorial approach, it may impact many fields of (opto)electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene Backbone Enables Two&#8208;Dimensional Poly(arylene vinylene)s with High Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linear conjugated polymers have attracted significant attention in organic electronics in recent decades. However, despite intrachain &#960;&#8208;delocalization, interchain hopping represents their transport bottleneck. In contrast, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated polymers, as represented by 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs), can provide multiple conjugated strands to enhance the delocalization of charge carriers in space. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of thiophene&#8208;based 2D poly(arylene vinylene)s (PAVs, 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT and 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, BDT= benzodithiophene, BT=bithiophene, BP=biphenyl) via Knoevenagel polycondensation. Compared with 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, the fully thiophene&#8208;based 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT exhibits enhanced planarity and &#960;&#8208;delocalization with a small band gap (1.62 eV) and large electronic band dispersion, as revealed by the optical absorption and density functional theory calculations. Remarkably, temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz spectroscopy discloses a unique band&#8208;like transport and outstanding room&#8208;temperature charge mobility for 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BT (65 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1), which far exceeds that of the linear PAVs, 2DPAV&#8208;BDT&#8208;BP, and the reported 2D c&#8208;COFs in the powder form. This work highlights the great potential of thiophene&#8208;based 2D PAVs as candidates for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>When Weak Is Strong: A Plea for Low&#8208;Affinity Binders for Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein labeling is a cornerstone of fluorescence microscopy. This is achieved using covalent or high&#8208;affinity target labels, which leads to a loss in fluorescence signal with time. Here, we highlight the new avenue of using reversible fluorophore labels, which exhibit a low binding affinity to their target and constantly &#8220;renew&#8221; the fluorescence signal. This enables novel biophysical applications across imaging platforms.







Abstract
The exploitation of low&#8208;affinity molecular interactions in protein labeling is an emerging topic in optical microscopy. Such non&#8208;covalent and low&#8208;affinity interactions can be realized with various concepts from chemistry and for different molecule classes, and lead to a constant renewal of fluorescence signals at target sites. Further benefits are a versatile use across microscopy methods, in 3D, live and many&#8208;target applications. In recent years, several classes of low&#8208;affinity labels were developed and a variety of powerful applications demonstrated. Still, this research field is underdeveloped, while the potential is huge.

         <title>Switchable Fluorescent Light&#8208;Up Aptamers Based on Riboswitch Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of switchable fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers is created by adopting a conformational switching principle derived from natural riboswitches. The aptamers can be activated or deactivated with RNA triggers or small molecules like guanine and adenine, providing highly sensitive switches with minimal signal leakage.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) such as Spinach or Mango can bind small fluorogens and activate their fluorescence. Here, we adopt a switching mechanism otherwise found in riboswitches and use it to engineer switchable FLAPs that can be activated or repressed by trigger oligonucleotides or small metabolites. The fluorophore binding pocket of the FLAPs comprises guanine (G) quadruplexes, whose critical nucleotides can be sequestered by corresponding anti&#8208;FLAP sequences, leading to an inactive conformation and thus preventing association with the fluorophore. We modified the FLAPs with designed toehold hairpins that carry either an anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence within the loop region. The addition of an input RNA molecule triggers a toehold&#8208;mediated strand invasion process that refolds the FLAP into an active or inactive configuration. Several of our designs display close&#8208;to&#8208;zero leak signals and correspondingly high ON/OFF fluorescence ratios. We also modified purine aptamers to sequester a partial anti&#8208;FLAP or an anti&#8208;anti&#8208;FLAP sequence to control the formation of the fluorogen&#8208;binding conformation, resulting in FLAPs whose fluorescence is activated or deactivated in the presence of guanine or adenine. We demonstrate that switching modules can be easily combined to generate FLAPs whose fluorescence depends on several inputs with different types of input logic.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the slow water dissociation process limits the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In their Research Article (e202300873), Emiliano Cort&#233;s et&#8197;al. designed an atomically asymmetric local electric field using Ir&#8208;Ru dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to optimize the dissociation process by tuning the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation. As a result, IrRu DSACs exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10 mA/cm2&#160;current density in a single cell and a high stability over 300&#8197;h at 1 A/cm2&#160;in a membrane electrode assembly.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Driven Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a concept for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate that is driven by substoichiometric amounts of electrons, introduced electrochemically. This protocol enables access to a variety of nitro&#8208;derived molecules from unsaturated hydrocarbons including alkenes, alkynes, and arenes, in addition to promoting ipso&#8208;nitration reactions and nitrative cyclizations with high levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. The mechanism of the reaction is supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this reaction has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy to scale for decagram quantities, and exhibit exceptional substrate generality and functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Modulation of Uptake and Reactivity of Nitrogen Dioxide in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of NO2 is modulated in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3, which leads to reaction between NO2 and framework Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A higher NO2 dynamic uptake (6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) is achieved, compared with the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305 (2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
We report the modulation of reactivity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in a charged metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 in which unbound N&#8208;centres are methylated and the cationic charge counter&#8208;balanced by Cl&#8722; ions in the pores. Uptake of NO2 into MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 leads to reaction between NO2 and Cl&#8722; to give nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and NO3&#8722; anions. A high dynamic uptake of 6.58&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K is observed for MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 as measured using a flow of 500&#8197;ppm NO2 in He. In contrast, the analogous neutral material, MFM&#8208;305, shows a much lower uptake of 2.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The binding domains and reactivity of adsorbed NO2 molecules within MFM&#8208;305&#8208;CH3 and MFM&#8208;305 have been probed using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering and by electron paramagnetic resonance, high&#8208;field solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and UV/Vis spectroscopies. The design of charged porous sorbents provides a new platform to control the reactivity of corrosive air pollutants.

         <title>Bispalladium(II) Complexes of di&#8208;p&#8208;Pyrirubyrin Derivatives as Promising Near&#8208;Infrared Photoacoustic Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show the synthesis and mutually reversible, fully controlled transformations of bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrins. The regioselective conversion of di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin into dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin leads to the incorporation of an unprecedented &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocycle skeleton. Significantly, all reported compounds have outstanding spectroscopic properties, including a photoacoustic response in the near&#8208;infrared I&#8211;II range.







Abstract
The insertion of palladium(II) into di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin results in mutually convertible bimetallic complexes. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of one of them yielded bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin and, after demetallation, dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin, introducing for the first time the &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;one unit into the macrocyclic frame. Bispalladium(II) di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 6, bispalladium(II) dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 9, and dioxo&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;pyrirubyrin 10 absorb and emit light around 1000&#8197;nm and are characterized by high photostability. Thus, they are promising candidates for near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic dyes, ideally targeting (9) the wavelength of Yb&#8208;based fiber lasers. The incorporation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;pyridine moiety into expanded porphyrins opens a highly interesting area of research due to the attractive optical and coordination properties of the resulting molecules.

         <title>Charting the Chemical Reaction Space around a Multicomponent Combination: Controlled Access to a Diverse Set of Biologically Relevant Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charting the reaction space around a known Multicomponent Reaction (MCR) allows the development of new processes. In this way, a detailed study of the parameters involved in the Orru transformation leads to the generation of alternative connectivities featuring diversely substituted imidazolones, including GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) chromophores, coelenterazine derivatives, natural products, kinase inhibitors, and bioprobes.







Abstract
Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C&#8208;2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N&#8208;derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.

         <title>Postsynthetic Photochemical Modification and 2D Structuring of Zr&#8208;MOF Thin Films Containing Benzophenone Linker Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin, porous and highly oriented films of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with benzophenone linker molecules were prepared as a new platform for photochemical postsynthetic modification. Potential reactivities range from targeted functionalization of the inner and outer surface, through grafting&#8208;from polymerization to true 2D patterning of defined structures.







Abstract
For the fabrication of next&#8208;generation MOF&#8208;based devices the availability of highly adaptable materials in suitable shapes is crucial. Here, we present thin films of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) containing photoreactive benzophenone units. Crystalline, oriented and porous films of the zirconium&#8208;based bzpdc&#8208;MOF (bzpdc=benzophenone&#8208;4&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate) are prepared by direct growth on silicon or glass substrates. Via a subsequent photochemical modification of the Zr&#8208;bzpdc&#8208;MOF films, various properties can be tuned postsynthetically by covalent attachment of modifying agents. Apart from the modification with small molecules, also grafting&#8208;from polymerization reactions are possible. In a further extension, 2D structuring and photo&#8208;writing of defined structures is also possible, for example by using a photolithographic approach, paving the way towards micro&#8208;patterned MOF surfaces.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8211;Glass Composite Membranes with Preferential Permeation of Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supported metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8211;glass composite membrane prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler produces a monolithic structure that eliminates non&#8208;selective grain boundaries, resulting in a preferential ultrahigh C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569 GPU and C2H6/C2H4 paraffin/olefin selectivity of 7.16.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glass is an easy to process and self&#8208;supported amorphous material that is suitable for fabricating gas separation membranes. However, MOF glasses, such as ZIF&#8208;62 and ZIF&#8208;4 have low porosity, which makes it difficult to obtain membranes with high permeance. Here, a self&#8208;supported MOF crystal&#8211;glass composite (CGC) membrane was prepared by melt quenching a mixture of ZIF&#8208;62 as the membrane matrix and ZIF&#8208;8 as the filler. The conversion of ZIF&#8208;62 from crystal to glass and the simultaneous partial melting of ZIF&#8208;8 facilitated by the melt state of ZIF&#8208;62 make the CGC membrane monolithic, eliminating non&#8208;selective grain boundaries and improving selectivity. The thickness of CGC membrane can be adjusted to fabricate a membrane without the need of a support substrate. CGC membranes exhibit a C2H6 permeance of 41&#8201;569&#8197;gas permeation units (GPU) and a C2H6/C2H4 selectivity of 7.16. The CGC membrane has abundant pores from the glassy state of ZIF&#8208;62 and the crystalline ZIF&#8208;8, which enables high gas permeance. ZIF&#8208;8 has preferential adsorption for C2H6 and promotes C2H6 transport in the membrane, and thus the GCG membrane exhibits ultrahigh C2H6 permeance and good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding can play a significant role in designing complex bioinspired structures. Here, two different types of this interaction were employed to construct single and double helices from planar benzotellurazole amides.







Abstract
As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.

         <title>Intermolecular Enantioselective Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination by Cationic Copper Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective intermolecular benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond amination by using a chiral cationic copper catalyst and oxidant di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide is reported. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Chiral benzylic amines are privileged motifs in pharmacologically active molecules. Intramolecular enantioselective radical C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer has emerged as a straightforward, powerful tool for the synthesis of chiral amines, but methods for intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination remain elusive. Herein, we report a cationic copper catalytic system for intermolecular enantioselective benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H amination with peroxide as an oxidant. This mild, straightforward method can be used to transform an array of feedstock alkylarenes and amides into chiral amines with high enantioselectivities, and it has good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. More importantly, it can be used to synthesize bioactive molecules, including chiral drugs. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the amination reaction involves benzylic radicals generated by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>A Glycosidic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Based Mass&#8208;Spectrometry&#8208;Cleavable Cross&#8208;linker Enables In Vivo Cross&#8208;linking for Protein Complex Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosidic&#8208;bond&#8208;based mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker has been developed that enables in vivo cross&#8208;linking for analyzing protein complexes. The MS&#8208;cleavable glycosidic bond of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) improves the accuracy of identification while increasing the search throughput. In addition, in vivo cross&#8208;linking is enabled in the living cell microenvironment because of the high biocompatibility, bioorthogonality, and amphipathicity of TDS.







Abstract
Chemical cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful technology to analyze protein complexes. However, the progress of in vivo CXMS studies has been limited by cross&#8208;linking biocompatibility and data analysis. Herein, a glycosidic bond&#8208;based MS&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker of trehalose disuccinimidyl ester (TDS) was designed and synthesized, which was fragmented in MS under CID/HCD to simplify the cross&#8208;linked peptides into conventional single peptides via selective cleavage between glycosidic and peptide bonds under individual MS collision energy. Consequently, the cross&#8208;linking identification accuracy and throughput were significantly enhanced, and the popular MS mode of stepped HCD was allowed. In addition, TDS showed proper cell&#8208;penetrating properties while being highly water&#8208;soluble, making it non&#8208;DMSO dependent during solubilization. Collectively, TDS provides a promising toolkit for CXMS characterization of living systems with high biocompatibility and accuracy.

         <title>Structure and Bonding in Amorphous Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous red phosphorus (a&#8208;P) can be described on the atomic scale by combining emerging machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based and dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT approaches. The a&#8208;P models reported here complete the first&#8208;principles stability range of the phosphorus allotropes, and they allow for new insight into chemical bonding and electronic states.







Abstract
Amorphous red phosphorus (a&#8208;P) is one of the remaining puzzling cases in the structural chemistry of the elements. Here, we elucidate the structure, stability, and chemical bonding in a&#8208;P from first principles, combining machine&#8208;learning and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) methods. We show that a&#8208;P structures exist with a range of energies slightly higher than those of phosphorus nanorods, to which they are closely related, and that the stability of a&#8208;P is linked to the degree of structural relaxation and medium&#8208;range order. We thus complete the stability range of phosphorus allotropes [Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 11629] by now including the previously poorly understood amorphous phase, and we quantify the covalent and van der Waals interactions in all main phases of phosphorus. We also study the electronic densities of states, including those of hydrogenated a&#8208;P. Beyond the present study, our structural models are expected to enable wider&#8208;ranging first&#8208;principles investigations&#8212;for example, of a&#8208;P&#8208;based battery materials.

         <title>Electrical Pulse&#8208;Driven Periodic Self&#8208;Repair of Cu&#8208;Ni Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a programmable pulsed electrolysis strategy to achieve reliable Cu/Cu2O structure, where Cu is oxidized to CuO during oxidation pulse, then regenerating Cu/Cu2O upon reduction. Compared to static NO3&#8722; electroreduction on Cu, the generated Cu/Cu2O enables breaking the rate&#8208;determining step of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction, resulting in superior performance for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction sustainably produces ammonia and alleviates water pollution, yet is still challenging due to the kinetic mismatch and hydrogen evolution competition. Cu/Cu2O heterojunction is proven effective to break the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; step for efficient NH3 conversion, while it is unstable due to electrochemical reconstruction. Here we report a programmable pulsed electrolysis strategy to achieve reliable Cu/Cu2O structure, where Cu is oxidized to CuO during oxidation pulse, then regenerating Cu/Cu2O upon reduction. Alloying with Ni further modulates hydrogen adsorption, which transfers from Ni/Ni(OH)2 to N&#8208;containing intermediates on Cu/Cu2O, promoting NH3 formation with a high NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Faraday efficiency (88.0&#177;1.6&#8201;%, pH&#8197;12) and NH3 yield rate (583.6&#177;2.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) under optimal pulsed conditions. This work provides new insights to in situ electrochemically regulate catalysts for NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of DNA Amphiphiles is Driven by Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular DNA nanosheets resembling bilayer membranes are obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of triblock DNA amphiphiles incorporating Cy3 chromophores. The hydrophobic chromophores are found to interact in a sequence&#8208;dependent manner with the hydrophilic DNA on the sheet surface, generating a chiral &#8220;signature&#8221; only upon formation of the thermodynamically stable nanosheet morphology.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies of water&#8208;soluble block copolymers have been limited by a dearth of systematic studies that relate polymer structure to pathway mechanism and supramolecular morphology. Here, we employ sequence&#8208;defined triblock DNA amphiphiles for the supramolecular polymerization of free&#8208;standing DNA nanosheets in water. Our systematic modulation of amphiphile sequence shows the alkyl chain core forming a cell membrane&#8208;like structure and the distal &#960;&#8208;stacking chromophore block folding back to interact with the hydrophilic DNA block on the nanosheet surface. This interaction is crucial to sheet formation, marked by a chiral &#8220;signature&#8221;, and sensitive to DNA sequence, where nanosheets form with a mixed sequence, but not with a homogeneous poly(thymine) sequence. This work opens the possibility of forming well&#8208;ordered, bilayer&#8208;like assemblies using a single DNA amphiphile for applications in cell sensing, nucleic acid therapeutic delivery and enzyme arrays.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Photocage Based on a Ruthenium Complex for Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru complex&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by NIR light was designed and was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers which self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, Ru complexes are released from the nanoparticles and effectively inhibit tumor proliferation in mice via combined chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, demonstrating the promising anticancer applications of the Ru&#8208;based photocage in vivo.







Abstract
Conventional photocages only respond to short wavelength light, which is a significant obstacle to developing efficient phototherapy in vivo. The development of photocages activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light at wavelengths from 700 to 950&#8197;nm is important for in vivo studies but remains challenging. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a photocage based on a ruthenium (Ru) complex with NIR light&#8208;triggered photocleavage reaction. The commercial anticancer drug, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), was coordinated to the RuII center to create the Ru&#8208;based photocage that is readily responsive to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm. The photocage inherited the anticancer properties of THC. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we further engineered a self&#8208;assembled photocage&#8208;based nanoparticle system with amphiphilic block copolymers. Upon exposure to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm, the Ru complex&#8208;based photocages were released from the polymeric nanoparticles and efficiently inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Response with Radical Afterglow by Regulation of Spin Populations and Hole&#8208;Electron Distributions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive radical materials with afterglow were developed. Spin populations and hole&#8208;electron analyses revealed that appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for stability and electronic transitions of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type radicals. Further on, the stimulus&#8208;responsive behaviors and multistage energy transfers were fully explored to expand the radical emission property.







Abstract
No matter photoinduced organic radicals have been reported frequently, they are usually non&#8208;luminescent at ambient conditions. The internal mechanism on stability and electronic transitions of photoinduced radicals, is thus crucial for the development of relevant materials. Herein, a series of photoinduced radical emission systems were developed conveniently through doping benzoic acids into the hydrogen donor polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. Visual photoinduced radical emission and photochromism could be observed on Ph&#8208;3COOH@PVA film with the formation of cyclohexadienyl&#8208;type structure. For the first time, radical afterglow appeared with energy transfer from triplet state. The appropriate introduction of carboxylic groups to three nonadjacent carbon atoms on the benzene ring was the best for decreasing spin population and promoting electronic transitions of the radical. This study largely expands the radical emission property from both internal mechanism and practical application.

         <title>The Telluraboranes closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 and closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 with Exceptionally Long Body Diagonals: Synthetic and Bonding Motifs for Innovative Octahedral and Icosahedral Geometries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the first small&#8208;sized polyhedral telluraborane, i.e. closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5, has been achieved in a two&#8208;component, one&#8208;pot thermal reaction of diboron tetrachloride and tellurium tetrachloride. The co&#8208;pyrolysis also generates the icosahedral closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11. The assembly of electron&#8208;deficient polyhedral frameworks from small, electron&#8208;precise precursory molecules provides a unique entry into the field of heteroatom&#8208;containing boranes.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB5Cl5 (1) and twelve&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;TeB11Cl11 (2) telluraboranes have been prepared via co&#8208;pyrolysis of B2Cl4 with TeCl4 in vacuo at temperatures between 360&#8201;&#176;C and 400&#8201;&#176;C. Both compounds are sublimable, off&#8208;white solids, and they have been characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B&#8197;NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectroscopy. Both ab initio/GIAO/NMR and DFT/ZORA/NMR computations support octahedral and icosahedral geometries for 1 and 2, respectively, as expected due to their closo&#8208;electron counts. The octahedral structure of 1 has been confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on an incommensurately modulated crystal. The corresponding bonding properties have been analyzed in terms of the intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) approach. 1 is the first example of a polyhedral telluraborane with a cluster size smaller than 10 vertices.

Catalytic transformation of renewable plant oils into industrially relevant &#945;&#8208;olefins in the C3 to C10 regime is demonstrated. The biorefinery concept is comprised of a catalytic sequence of ethenolysis, double bond isomerization, and a subsequent ethenolysis, thereby cutting and rearranging the fatty acid chains into valuable chemical building blocks. A benign extraction and reaction solvent, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), is utilized.

         <title>Minimizing Temperature Bias through Reliable Temperature Determination in Gas&#8208;Solid Photothermal Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of temperature determination bias in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions was systematically uncovered. Further, a universal protocol was developed, including the reasonable system optimization for ameliorating the temperature distribution and temperature control of the catalyst layer, accompanied by cross&#8208;corroboration of multiple thermometry for reliable temperature assessment in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.







Abstract
Enormous advances in photothermal catalysis have been made over the years, whereas the temperature assessment still remains controversial in the majority of photothermal catalytic systems. Herein, we methodically uncovered the phenomenon of temperature determination bias arising from prominent temperature differences in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic systems, which extensively existed yet has been overlooked in most relevant cases. To avoid the interference of temperature bias, we developed a universal protocol for reliable temperature evaluation of gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalytic reactions, with emphasis on eliminating the temperature gradient and temperature fluctuation of catalyst layer via optimizing the reaction system. This work presents a functional and credible practice for temperature detection, calling attention to addressing the effects of temperature differences, and reassessing the actual temperature&#8208;based performances in gas&#8208;solid photothermal catalysis.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Elastin&#8208;Like Peptide&#8208;Based Targeted Nanoparticles for Enhanced Spheroid Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;responsive targeted nanoparticle based on elastin&#8208;like polypeptides and loaded with photosensitizers, is able to transform rapidly into a small nanocluster for enhanced penetration into spheroids. The nanocluster still has its targeting function and thus is highly efficient in both cargo delivery and cell&#8208;killing in photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
We describe here a near infrared light&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like peptide (ELP)&#8208;based targeted nanoparticle (NP) that can rapidly switch its size from 120 to 25&#8197;nm upon photo&#8208;irradiation. Interestingly, the targeting function, which is crucial for effective cargo delivery, is preserved after transformation. The NPs are assembled from (targeted) diblock ELP micelles encapsulating photosensitizer TT1&#8208;monoblock ELP conjugates. Methionine residues in this monoblock are photo&#8208;oxidized by singlet oxygen generated from TT1, turning the ELPs hydrophilic and thus trigger NP dissociation. Phenylalanine residues from the diblocks then interact with TT1 via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, inducing the re&#8208;formation of smaller NPs. Due to their small size and targeting function, the NPs penetrate deeper in spheroids and kill cancer cells more efficiently compared to the larger ones. This work could contribute to the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; nanomedicines with deeper penetration capacity for effective anticancer therapies.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Biomolecules with Carbon Nanotubes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensors for the neurotransmitter dopamine are reported. These sensors change their fluorescence lifetime and this is measured by pulsed excitation and single&#8208;photon counting. Lifetimes are sensitive to the concentration of dopamine, which can be used for imaging dopamine release by cells.







Abstract
Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are versatile near infrared (NIR) fluorescent building blocks for biosensors. Their surface is chemically tailored to respond to analytes by a change in fluorescence. However, intensity&#8208;based signals are easily affected by external factors such as sample movements. Here, we demonstrate fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of SWCNT&#8208;based sensors in the NIR. We tailor a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for NIR signals (&gt;800&#8197;nm) and employ time correlated single photon counting of (GT)10&#8208;DNA functionalized SWCNTs. They act as sensors for the important neurotransmitter dopamine. Their fluorescence lifetime (&gt;900&#8197;nm) decays biexponentially and the longer lifetime component (370&#8197;ps) increases by up to 25&#8201;% with dopamine concentration. These sensors serve as paint to cover cells and report extracellular dopamine in 3D via FLIM. Therefore, we demonstrate the potential of fluorescence lifetime as a readout of SWCNT&#8208;based NIR sensors.

         <title>Chemical Communication and Protocell&#8208;Matrix Dynamics in Segregated Colloidosome Micro&#8208;Colonies</title>

         <dc:description>
Janus&#8208;like covalent/ionic crosslinked hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;loaded protocells were constructed and used as integrated platforms for domain&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics.







Abstract
Despite an emerging catalogue of collective behaviours in communities of homogeneously distributed cell&#8208;like objects, microscale protocell colonies with spatially segregated populations have received minimal attention. Here, we use microfluidics to fabricate Janus&#8208;like calcium alginate hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;containing inorganic colloidosomes and investigate their potential as integrated platforms for domain&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics. Diffusive chemical signalling within the segregated communities gives rise to increased initial enzyme kinetics compared with a homogeneous distribution of protocells. We employ competing enzyme&#8208;mediated hydrogel crosslinking and decrosslinking reactions in different domains of the partitioned colonies to undertake selective expulsion of a specific protocell population from the community. Our results offer new possibilities for the design and construction of spatially organized cytomimetic consortia capable of endogenous chemical processing and protocell&#8208;environment interactivity.

         <title>Paired Oxidative and Reductive Catalysis: Breaking the Potential Barrier of Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H Alkenylation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired electrocatalysis strategy for alkane functionalization is reported for the first time, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. Importantly, C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation of alkanes with ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential (&#8776;0.25&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl) is achieved using this protocol, providing a modular method for versatile mono&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted olefins under mild conditions.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsic inertness of alkanes, strong oxidative conditions are typically required to enable their C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein, a paired electrocatalysis strategy was developed by integrating oxidative catalysis with reductive catalysis in one cell without interference, in which earth&#8208;abundant iron and nickel are employed as the anodic and cathodic catalysts, respectively. This approach lowers the previously high oxidation potential required for alkane activation, enabling electrochemical alkane functionalization at the ultra&#8208;low oxidation potential of &#8776;0.25&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl under mild conditions. Structurally diverse alkenes, including challenging all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted olefins, can be accessed using readily available alkenyl electrophiles.

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Spinel ZnCo2O4 through Filling Oxygen Vacancies with Fluorine for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we successfully filled the lattice oxygen vacancies of ZnCo2O4 with F atom, achieving the activation of lattice oxygen by regulating metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization, and the dominant oxygen evolution reaction mechanism on ZnCo2O4 can transform from adsorbate evolution mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism.







Abstract
The development of productive catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge requiring significant progress in both mechanism and material design. Conventionally, the thermodynamic barrier of lattice oxidation mechanism (LOM) is lower than that of absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) because the former can overcome certain limitations. However, controlling the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM by exploiting the intrinsic properties of the catalyst remains challenging. Herein, we incorporated F anions into the oxygen vacancies of spinel ZnCo2O4 and established a link between the electronic structure and the OER catalytic mechanism. Theoretical density calculations revealed that F upshifts the O 2p center and activates the redox capability of lattice O, successfully triggering the LOM pathway. Moreover, the high electronegativity of F anions is favourable for balancing the residual protonation, which can stabilize the structure of the catalyst.

         <title>A Space&#8208;Confined Polymerization Templated by Ice Enables Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sheets of a conjugated polymer were prepared via a space&#8208;confined polymerization method that uses ice as a template. The key step of this strategy is the transportation of monomer to ice crystal boundaries using micelles as carriers, followed by oxidative polymerization in a frozen state. After characterization, the 2D sheets were assembled to self&#8208;standing films and found to exhibit excellent performance when used as electrodes in supercapacitors.







Abstract
Despite significant progress in the preparation and characterization of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, the synthesis of 2D organic materials remains challenging. Here, we report a novel space&#8208;confined polymerization method that enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis of 2D sheets of a functional conjugated polymer, namely, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A key step in this method is the confinement of monomer to the boundaries of ice crystals using micelles. This spatial confinement directs the polymerization to form 2D PEDOT sheets with high crystallinity and controlled morphology. Supercapacitors prepared from the 2D PEDOT sheets exhibit outstanding performance metrics. In aqueous electrolyte, a high areal specific capacitance of 898&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 along with an excellent rate capability is achieved (e.g., capacitance retention of 67.6&#8201;% at a 50&#8208;fold higher current). Moreover, the 2D PEDOT&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.5&#8201;% after 30,000 cycles). Device performance is further improved when an organic electrolyte is used.

         <title>A Simple Approach to Solution&#8208;Processible Small&#8208;Molecule Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters for High&#8208;Performance Narrowband OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is developed, and the resulting narrowband emissive organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 27.1&#8201;% and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 31&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Most multi&#8208;resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters generally exhibit strong aggregation and relatively worse solubility due to their rigid and planar molecule structures, which is highly undesirable for solution&#8208;processible devices. Herein, a simple but feasible approach for solution&#8208;processible small&#8208;molecule MR&#8208;TADF emitters is developed by incorporating two MR&#8208;TADF units onto carbazole bridge bearing long alkyl chains. The obtained emitters demonstrate supreme film&#8208;forming capability and narrowband emissions with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 22&#8197;nm. The resulting solution&#8208;processed narrowband electroluminescent devices achieve maximum external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;%, which represents the highest efficiency among the solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters. This simple approach reveals great potential of developing solution&#8208;processible emitters for rigid and planar molecular structures.

         <title>Thiazolylazopyrazoles as Nonsymmetric Bis&#8208;Heteroaryl Azo Switches: High&#8208;Yield Visible&#8208;Light Photoisomerization and Increased Z&#8208;Isomer Stability by o&#8208;Carbonylation</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiazolylazopyrazoles are developed as nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches that achieve (near&#8208;)quantitative isomerization in both directions by o&#8208;substitution. The Z&#8208;isomer half&#8208;lives can be prolonged to several days through inducing attractive intramolecular interactions to an o&#8208;carbonyl group on the pyrazole. In contrast, o&#8208;methylation of the pyrazole results in a destabilizing effect.







Abstract
Following the progress on mono&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches (Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Ph), a few bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches (Het&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het) have been studied recently, whereas the nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl ones (Het1&#8208;N=N&#8208;Het2) that can combine the respective merits of each heterocycle, have received little attention. Here we report thiazolylazopyrazoles as nonsymmetric bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches that combine the visible&#8208;light switching character of the thiazole ring and the ease of o&#8208;substitution of the pyrazole ring. Thiazolylazopyrazoles can achieve (near&#8208;)quantitative visible&#8208;light isomerization in both directions and long Z&#8208;isomer thermal half&#8208;lives of several days. In contrast to the drastically destabilizing effect of o&#8208;methylation, o&#8208;carbonylation of the pyrazole ring can remarkably stabilize Z isomers by inducing attractive intramolecular interactions (dispersion, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N bond, and lone&#8208;pair&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction). Our work highlights the importance of the rational combination of two heterocycles and suitable structural substitution in developing bis&#8208;heteroaryl azo switches.

         <title>Not So Innocent After All: Interfacial Chemistry Determines Charge&#8208;Transport Efficiency in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial chemistry of a single&#8208;molecule junction plays a pivotal role in determining the final charge&#8208;transport efficiency. Internal charge reorganisation is responsible for the observed behaviour, and the results provide a general, intuitive strategy for the structural design of efficient molecular wires.







Abstract
Most studies in molecular electronics focus on altering the molecular wire backbone to tune the electrical properties of the whole junction. However, it is often overlooked that the chemical structure of the groups anchoring the molecule to the metallic electrodes influences the electronic structure of the whole system and, therefore, its conductance. We synthesised electron&#8208;accepting dithienophosphole oxide derivatives and fabricated their single&#8208;molecule junctions. We found that the anchor group has a dramatic effect on charge&#8208;transport efficiency: in our case, electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;pyridyl contacts suppress conductance, while electron&#8208;rich 4&#8208;thioanisole termini promote efficient transport. Our calculations show that this is due to minute changes in charge distribution, probed at the electrode interface. Our findings provide a framework for efficient molecular junction design, especially valuable for compounds with strong electron withdrawing/donating backbones.

         <title>Delayed Doublet Emission in a Cerium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report a CeIII complex with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which is realized by a small positive energy gap &#916;ETD between the doublet (D1) and triplet (T1) excited states. The &#916;ETD is deduced to be 0.220&#8197;eV from the Arrhenius plot. The mechanism discovered enriches our understandings about the excited state relaxation process and may bring insights into rational energy level regulation of doublet emission.







Abstract
Doublet emission from open&#8208;shell molecules has demonstrated its research and application value in recent years. However, understandings of the photoluminescence mechanism of open&#8208;shell molecules are far less than that of closed&#8208;shell molecules, leading to challenges in molecular design of efficient doublet emission systems. Here we report a cerium(III) 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbozol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl&#8208;tris(pyrazolyl)borate complex Ce(CzPhTp)3 with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which also represents the first example with metal&#8208;centered delayed photoluminescence. The energy gap between the doublet and triplet excited states of Ce(CzPhTp)3 is reduced by the management of the inner and outer coordination spheres, thereby promoting efficient energy transfer between the two excited states and activating the delayed emission. The photoluminescence mechanism discovered may provide a new way for the design of efficient doublet emission and bring insights into rational molecular design and energy level regulation in open&#8208;shell molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Here we report a Ce&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which is realized by a small positive energy gap &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TD&lt;/sub&gt; between the doublet (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and triplet (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) excited states. The &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TD&lt;/sub&gt; is deduced to be 0.220&#8197;eV from the Arrhenius plot. The mechanism discovered enriches our understandings about the excited state relaxation process and may bring insights into rational energy level regulation of doublet emission.

         <title>A General and Practical Route to Functionalized Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane&#8208;Heteroaryls Enabled by Photocatalytic Multicomponent Heteroarylation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report a conceptually different approach to access diverse arylated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs). A wide variety of alkyl radicals derived from alkyltrifluoroborates and alkylsilicates were successfully incorporated to form a range of synthetically valuable 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized heteroarylated BCPs. Moreover, more electron&#8208;deficient &#8901;CF2H or &#8901;CF3 radicals were also found to be amenable, affording fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heteroaryl BCPs







Abstract
1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) are an important class of BCP derivatives with widespread application in drug development. Most syntheses of these materials require multiple chemical steps via BCP electrophiles or nucleophiles derived from [1.1.1]propellane. Although one&#8208;step, multicomponent radical cross&#8208;coupling reactions could provide a more sustainable and rapid route to access diverse heteroarylated BCPs, current approaches are limited to tertiary alkyl radicals, leading to a decrease in their practical value. In this study, a conceptually different approach enabled by a radical multicomponent heteroarylation of [1.1.1]propellane to access functionalized heteroarylated BCPs is described. Importantly, this protocol is compatible with primary&#8208;, secondary&#8208;, and tertiary aliphatic radicals, as well as various fluoroalkyl radical sources, thus enabling rapid library generation of sought&#8208;after BCP derivatives for drug development.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Carbon&#8208;Sequestrated Seawater into Stoichiometric CO and HClO with Nitrogen&#8208;Doped BiOCl Atomic Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers can directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater into stoichiometric CO and HClO under visible light with selectivities greater than 90&#8201;%. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships.







Abstract
Seawater is one of the most important CO2 sequestration media for delivering value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels and active chlorine; however, this scenario is plagued by sluggish reaction rates and poor product selectivity. Herein, we first report the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped BiOCl atomic layers to directly split carbon&#8208;sequestrated natural seawater (Yellow Sea, China) into stoichiometric CO (92.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) and HClO (83.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light with selectivities greater than 90&#8201;%. Photoelectrons enriched on the exposed BiOCl{001} facet kinetically facilitate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction via surface&#8208;doped nitrogen bearing Lewis basicity. Photoholes, mainly located on the lateral facets of van der Waals gaps, promote the selective oxidation of Cl&#8722; into HClO. Sequestrated CO2 also maintains the pH of seawater at around 4.2 to prevent the alkaline earth cations from precipitating. The produced HClO can effectively kill typical bacteria in the ballast water of ocean&#8208;going cargo ships, offering a green and safe way for onsite sterilization.

         <title>Photocatalytic Metal Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer Mediated Allene Functionalization by Cobalt and Titanium Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is on the photo Co metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reaction for chemoselective allene functionalization by using Co&#8208;porphines as catalysts and the Hantzsch ester as an H atom and electron donor. The merger of Co MHAT and Ti catalysis under photoredox conditions enabled successful carbonyl allylation, providing access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Catalytic metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) reactions have proven to be a powerful method for alkene functionalization. This work reports the discovery of Co&#8208;porphines as highly efficient MHAT catalysts with a loading of only 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% for unprecedented chemoselective allene functionalization under photoirradiation. Moreover, the newly developed bimetallic strategy by the combination of photo Co&#8208;MHAT and Ti catalysis enabled the successful carbonyl allylation with a wide range of amino, oxy, thio, aryl, and alkyl&#8208;allenes providing expedient access to valuable &#946;&#8208;functionalized homoallylic alcohols in over 100 examples with exceptional regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanism studies and DFT calculations supported that selectively transferring hydrogen atoms from cobalt hydride to allenes and generating allyl radicals is the key step in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction for Preparing Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed to construct a fused multicyclic linkage with high rigidity and a large contortion. A novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization was developed based on this reaction to prepare PIMs with high molecular weights, high specific surface areas, and H2 separation performance.







Abstract
It is a formidable challenge in polycondensation to simultaneously construct multiple covalent bonds to prepare double&#8208;stranded polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with fused multicyclic linkages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction for successfully preparing double&#8208;stranded PIMs with fused multicyclic backbone structures. A self&#8208;accelerating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction was developed based on the [4+2] cycloaddition of sym&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyne (DIBOD) and ortho&#8208;quinone compounds. In this reaction, the cycloaddition of ortho&#8208;quinone with the first alkyne of DIBOD activates the second alkyne, which reacts with ortho&#8208;quinone at a rate constant 192 times larger than that of the original alkyne. Using this self&#8208;accelerating reaction to polymerize DIBOD and spirocyclic/cyclic difunctional ortho&#8208;quinone monomers, a novel stoichiometric imbalance&#8208;promoted step&#8208;growth polymerization method was developed to prepare PIMs. The resultant PIMs possess intrinsic ultramicropores with pore sizes between 0.45 to 0.7&#8197;nm, high specific surface areas above 646&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and good H2 separation performance.

Using this self-accelerating reaction to polymerize DIBOD and spirocyclic/cyclic difunctional &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-quinone monomers, a novel stoichiometric imbalance-promoted step-growth polymerization method was developed to prepare PIMs. The resultant PIMs possess intrinsic ultramicropores with pore sizes between 0.45 to 0.7&#8197;nm, high specific surface areas above 646&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and good H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetism in Nonplanar Zigzag Edge Termini of Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended 7&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon with unique termini structures was synthesized on Au(111) using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. A Kondo resonance was observed for termini with nonplanar zigzag edges even on a bare Au(111) surface. DFT calculations revealed that the recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag terminus resulted from its weak interaction with the Au(111) because of its nonplanar conformation.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and nanographenes synthesized by on&#8208;surface reactions using tailor&#8208;made molecular precursors offer an ideal playground for a study of magnetism towards nano&#8208;spintronics. Although the zigzag edge of GNRs has been known to host magnetism, the underlying metal substrates usually veil the edge&#8208;induced Kondo effect. Here, we report the on&#8208;surface synthesis of unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended 7&#8208;armchair GNRs using 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;12&#8208;(10&#8208;bromoanthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)tetraphene as the precursor. Characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy revealed unique rearrangement reactions leading to pentagon&#8208; or pentagon/heptagon&#8208;incorporated, nonplanar zigzag termini, which demonstrated Kondo resonances even on bare Au(111). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the nonplanar structure significantly reduces the interaction between the zigzag terminus and the Au(111) surface, leading to a recovery of the spin localization of the zigzag edge. Such a distortion of planar GNR structures offers a degree of freedom to control the magnetism on metal substrates.

         <title>Functionalized Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered carbocyclic rings are synthesized by stitching up all fjords of resorcin[4]arene derivatives through fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions and subsequent transformations of ketones. They are powerful and selective hosts to capture cesium ion to form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complexes with binding constants being up to 1.5&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 1.7&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2, respectively.







Abstract
Hydrocarbon belts have drawn great attention because of their unique structures and tantalizing properties. Although a few belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have been synthesized, belt molecules containing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain rare. Herein we report the construction and application of unprecedented zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis features fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions of resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived intermediates, which affords C4&#8208;symmetric tetrabenzobelt[4]arene[4]cyclooctatrienones. Stereoselective ketone reduction with LiAlH4 and nucleophilic addition with alkynyllithiums provide the corresponding tetrahydroxylated belts. The tetraol and its methyl ether are powerful and selective hosts to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with cesium ion, respectively, with binding constants up to (1.71&#177;0.33)&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2 and (1.50&#177;0.16)&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. In addition, enantiopure C4&#8208;symmetric belts can emit CPL with |glum| being around 0.01.

         <title>Designing Breathing Air&#8208;electrode and Enhancing the Oxygen Electrocatalysis by Thermoelectric Effect for Efficient Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a new breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using P&#8208;type and N&#8208;type thermoelectrocatalysts as charge and discharge electrodes, respectively. Benefiting from the thermoelectric generated Seebeck voltages and carrier accumulation, the intrinsic oxygen catalytic activity was impressively enhanced. The breathing ZAB displayed a remarkable charge/discharge voltage gap and energy efficiency.







Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and mutual interference of oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in the air electrode resulted in large charge/discharge overpotential and low energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, we designed a breathing air&#8208;electrode configuration in the battery using P&#8208;type Ca3Co4O9 and N&#8208;type CaMnO3 as charge and discharge thermoelectrocatalysts, respectively. The Seebeck voltages generated from thermoelectric effect of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 synergistically compensated the charge and discharge overpotentials. The carrier migration and accumulation on the cold surface of Ca3Co4O9 and CaMnO3 optimized the electronic structure of metallic sites and thus enhanced their intrinsic catalytic activity. The oxygen evolution and reduction overpotentials were enhanced by 101 and 90&#8197;mV, respectively, at temperature gradient of 200&#8201;&#176;C. The breathing Zn&#8208;air battery displayed a remarkable energy efficiency of 68.1&#8201;%. This work provides an efficient avenue towards utilizing waste heat for improving the energy efficiency of Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Redox Chemistry of p&#8208;Type Poly(vinyldimethylphenazine) Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material containing 5,10&#8208;dimethyldihydrophenazine as active moieties is presented. Its electrochemical characterization revealed an anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry. Based on the optimized formula of cathode and electrolyte solution, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyldihydrophenazine) (PVDMP) cathode delivered high voltage, high capacity and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free organic electrode materials have attracted vast research attention owing to their designable structures and tunable electrochemical properties. Although n&#8208;type cathode materials could be used in various metal&#8208;ion batteries, p&#8208;type ones with high potential can deliver high energy density. Herein, we report a new p&#8208;type polymeric cathode material, poly(2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine) (PVDMP), with a theoretical capacity of 227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. PVDMP featuring two&#8208;step redox reaction will be doped by two anions to maintain electroneutrality during oxidation, which resulted in an anion&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior of PVDMP&#8208;based cathode. The suitable dopant anion for PVDMP was selected and the doping mechanism was confirmed. Under the optimized condition, PVDMP cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C and even remains 150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3900&#8197;cycles. This work not only provides a new kind of p&#8208;type organic cathode materials but also deepens the understanding of its anion&#8208;dependent redox chemistry.

         <title>Unveiling One&#8208;to&#8208;One Correspondence Between Excited Triplet States and Determinate Interactions by Temperature&#8208;Controllable Blue&#8208;Green&#8208;Yellow Afterglow</title>

The one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between excited triplet states and the determinate intermolecular interactions has been established for the first time, by temperature&#8208;controllable blue&#8208;green&#8208;yellow afterglow with hierarchically unlocking intermolecular interactions, which was further confirmed and improved by the deuterated analogue, guiding the accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.







Abstract
Phosphorescence of organic materials is highly dependent on intermolecular interactions, for the sensitive triplet excitons toward environment and aggregated structures. However, until now, relationship between phosphorescence and intermolecular interactions is still unclear for complicated influence factors and uncontrollable aggregated behaviors. Herein, taking temperature as the controlled variable, the afterglow can continuously change from blue to green, then to yellow, even achieve the white emission with deuteration process. It is mainly due to the hierarchical architectures of molecular aggregates with rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, as well as gradually unlocking process of interactions with different energies. Accordingly, the one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence between the determinate interactions and excited triplet states have been established, guiding accurate design of desirable phosphorescence materials by hierarchical control of aggregated structures.

         <title>A Linear C=Ge=C Heteroallene with a Di&#8208;coordinated Germanium Atom

A stable 2&#8208;germapropadiene adopts a linear structure in solution and the solid state: It has a formally sp&#8208;hybridized central germanium atom and two orthogonal C=Ge &#960;&#8208;bonds. The linear geometry arises from the negative hyperconjugation of the bulky silyl substituents at the terminal carbon atoms. The germanium atom is highly electrophilic and the allene&#8208;type character of the molecule is fully characterized and confirmed by its reactivity.







Abstract
Allenes (&gt;C=C=C&lt;) are classified as cumulated dienes with a linear structure and an sp&#8208;hybridized central carbon atom. We have synthesized and isolated a stable 2&#8208;germapropadiene with bulky silyl substituents. The 2&#8208;germapropadiene allene moiety adopts a linear structure both in the solid state and in solution. An X&#8208;ray diffraction electron&#8208;density&#8208;distribution (EDD) analysis of this 2&#8208;germapropadiene confirmed the linear C=Ge=C geometry with a formally sp&#8208;hybridized germanium atom that bears two orthogonal C=Ge &#960;&#8208;bonds. Based on detailed structural and computational studies, we concluded that the linear geometry of the isolated 2&#8208;germapropadiene most likely arises from the negative hyperconjugation of the silyl substituents at the terminal carbon atoms. The 2&#8208;germapropadiene reacts rapidly with nucleophiles, indicating that the linearly oriented germanium atom is highly electrophilic.

         <title>Decoding the Fucose Migration Product during Mass&#8208;Spectrometric analysis of Blood Group Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis of glycans. Here, ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations are used to deduce the product of the internal glycan rearrangement of two model trisaccharides.







Abstract
Fucose is a signaling carbohydrate that is attached at the end of glycan processing. It is involved in a range of processes, such as the selectin&#8208;dependent leukocyte adhesion or pathogen&#8208;receptor interactions. Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques, which are commonly used to determine the structure of glycans, frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis. The rearrangement leading to these fragments&#8212;often referred to as fucose migration&#8212;has been known for more than 25&#8197;years, but the chemical identity of the rearrangement product remains unclear. In this work, we combine ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations to deduce the product of the rearrangement in the model trisaccharides Lewis x and blood group H2. The structural search yields the fucose moiety attached to the galactose with an &#945;(1&#8594;6) glycosidic bond as the most likely product.

         <title>Insights into the Oxidative Degradation Mechanism of Solid Amine Sorbents for CO2 Capture from Air: Roles of Atmospheric Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processes for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 uniquely operate outdoors in different weather conditions. The oxidative stability of amine&#8208;based sorbents is a critical parameter with economic and environmental impacts on DAC processes. Here we elucidate the impact of ubiquitous atmospheric water vapor on the oxidative stability of DAC sorbents, providing insights into the design of robust sorbents for the practical deployment of DAC technology.







Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) processes for extraction of CO2 from ambient air are unique among chemical processes in that they operate outdoors with minimal feed pretreatments. Here, the impact of humidity on the oxidative degradation of a prototypical solid supported amine sorbent, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on Al2O3, is explored in detail. By combining CO2 adsorption measurements, oxidative degradation rates, elemental analyses, solid&#8208;state NMR and in situ IR spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with 18O labeling of water, a comprehensive picture of sorbent oxidation is achieved under accelerated conditions. We demonstrated that the presence of water vapor can play an important role in accelerating the degradation reactions. From the study we inferred the identity and kinetics of formation of the major oxidative products, and the role(s) of humidity. Our data are consistent with a radical mediated autooxidative degradation mechanism.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Advantaged Stereoregular Recyclable Plastics Enabled by Aluminum&#8208;Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Dithiolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions. By proper ligand design and modification, the aluminum catalysts enabled the production of highly isotactic, stereocomplexed polythioester. The obtained dithiolactone&#8208;based plastic is a tough semicrystalline material, and exhibits complete recyclability.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable polymers that can depolymerize into their constituent monomers are attractive candidates to replace non&#8208;recyclable petroleum&#8208;derived plastics. However, the physical properties and mechanical strengths of depolymerizable polymers are commonly insufficient for practical applications. Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring&#8208;opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5&#8197;kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a Tm of 94.5&#8201;&#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum&#8208;based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance&#8208;advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.

Here we demonstrate that by proper ligand design and modification, aluminum complexes can catalyse stereoretentive ring-opening polymerization of dithiolactone, yielding highly isotactic polythioesters with molar masses up to 45.5&#8197;kDa. This material can form crystalline stereocomplex with a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 94.5&#8201;&#176;C, and exhibits mechanical performances comparable to petroleum-based low density polyethylene. Exposure of the polythioester to aluminum precatalyst used to synthesized it resulted in depolymerization to pristine chiral dithiolactone. Experimental and computational studies suggest that aluminum complexes have appropriate binding affinity with sulfide propagating species, thereby avoiding catalyst poisoning and minimizing epimerization reactions, which has not been accessible using other metal catalysts. Overall, aluminum catalysis provides access to performance-advantaged stereoregular recyclable plastics as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, thus incentivizing improved plastic sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[n]Cycloparaphenylene&#8208;Pillar[5]arene Bismacrocycles: Their Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Multiple Guest Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismacrocycles are presented. [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]As show multiple guest recognition and promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.02).







Abstract
Both pillar[n]arenes (P[n]As) and [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) play an important role in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report the precise synthesis of two multifunctional bismacrocycles [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A by integrating P[5]A into the [n]CPP backbone. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of the bismacrocycles was found to show a dramatic increase relative to the corresponding [n]CPPs. The chiral enantiomers (pR)/(pS)&#8208;[8]CPP&#8208;P[5]A were successfully isolated by chiral HPLC, and showed promising properties of circularly polarized luminescence (glum&#8776;0.02). In addition, [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A bismacrocycles are capable of binding pyridinium salts and fullerene derivatives with high affinity and specificity within the two distinct cavities. Transient absorption studies showed that photo&#8208;induced electron transfer occurs in [10]CPP&#8208;P[5]A&#8835;C60 complex. Our results suggest that [n]CPP&#8208;P[5]A are potentially useful in CPL&#8208;active materials, multiple guest recognition and supramolecular polymer preparation.

         <title>Virus&#8208;Like Particle&#8208;Induced cGAS&#8208;STING Activation and AIM2 Inflammasome&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a virus&#8208;like particle loaded with densely packed DNA and covered with cationic liposomes. It not only induces liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activates STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines, but it also triggers the formation of AIM2 inflammasome and induces gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis to boost antitumor immunity, thus realizing efficient immunotherapy and tumor growth inhibition.







Abstract
cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;mediated DNA sensing is demonstrated to be critical for launching antitumor immunity. However, DNA&#8208;based cGAS&#8208;STING agonists are rarely reported owing to low cell permeability, poor biostability and, especially, limited length of exogenous DNA. Here, we present a virus&#8208;like particle which is self&#8208;assembled from long DNA building blocks generated through rolling&#8208;circle amplification (RCA) and covered with cationic liposomes. Based on long and densely packed DNA structure, it could efficiently induce liquid phase condensation of cGAS and activate STING signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, this virus&#8208;like particle could also trigger the formation of AIM2 inflammasome to induce gasdermin D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, boosting antitumor immunity. Thus, this study provides a simple and robust strategy for cancer immunotherapy for clinical application. This is the first study to report the intrinsic immunogenicity of RCA products, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.

         <title>Controlled Continuous Evolution of Enzymatic Activity Screened at Ultrahigh Throughput Using Drop&#8208;Based Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel nCAS9&#8208;mutagenic polymerase&#8208;based continuous evolution platform for improvement of enzymatic activity that functions at ultra&#8208;high throughput. By cycling cells between growth, mutagenesis, and microfluidics&#8208;based sorting, we mimic natural evolution but at a pace that is orders of magnitude faster, yielding an alditol oxidase variant with 10.5&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency for waste product, glycerol as a substrate.







Abstract
Enzymes are highly specific catalysts delivering improved drugs and greener industrial processes. Naturally occurring enzymes must typically be optimized which is often accomplished through directed evolution; however, this is still a labor&#8208; and capital&#8208;intensive process, due in part to multiple molecular biology steps including DNA extraction, in vitro library generation, transformation, and limited screening throughput. We present an effective and broadly applicable continuous evolution platform that enables controlled exploration of fitness landscape to evolve enzymes at ultrahigh throughput based on direct measurement of enzymatic activity. This drop&#8208;based microfluidics platform cycles cells between growth and mutagenesis followed by screening with minimal human intervention, relying on the nCas9 chimera with mutagenesis polymerase to produce in vivo gene diversification using sgRNAs tiled along the gene. We evolve alditol oxidase to change its substrate specificity towards glycerol, turning a waste product into a valuable feedstock. We identify a variant with a 10.5&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Mapping the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Gasoline Process Over Zeolite Beta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal and complementary spectroscopic strategy (involving operando UV/Visible spectroscopy coupled to online mass spectrometry and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) delivers a mechanistic blueprint of the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline process by elucidating the impact of carbonylated and oxymethylene species.







Abstract
Decarbonizing the transportation sector is among the biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. CO2&#8208;neutral fuels, such as those obtained from renewable methanol, have the potential to account for a large share of the solution, since these could be directly compatible with existing power trains. Although discovered in 1977, the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;gasoline (MTG) process has hardly reached industrial maturity, among other reasons, because maximizing the production of gasoline range hydrocarbons from methanol has proved complicated. In this work, we apply multimodal operando UV/Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy coupled with an online mass spectrometer and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy to better understand the reaction mechanism over zeolites H&#8208;Beta and Zn&#8208;Beta. Significantly, the influential co&#8208;catalytic role of oxymethylene species is linked to gasoline formation, which impacts the MTG process more than carbonylated species.

         <title>Tungstate&#8208;mediated In&#8208;situ Passivation of Grain Boundary Grooves in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a simple &#8220;two&#8208;step&#8221; in situ reaction approach to construct stable tungstate/perovskite (PVSK) heterointerfaces at grain boundary grooves (GBGs) in perovskite solar cells. The proposed passivation involved strong ionic bonds with explicitly tuned band energetics in the heterointerface. Accordingly, the uncoordinated Pb2+ could be effectively passivated via the tungstate ions, meanwhile the type&#8208;I PVSK/tungstate heterointerfaces could reduce recombination loss via repelling carriers from grain boundaries back to the intra&#8208;grain section. Thus, the resulting sample showed improved device performance both in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n and n&#8208;i&#8208;p structure, which demonstrated the universality and validity of our passivation strategy.







Abstract
Possessed with advantageous optoelectronic properties, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solution&#8208;processed solar cells. The performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is significantly weakened by the carrier loss at grain boundary grooves (GBGs); however, it receives limited attention and there lacks effective approach to solve this issue. Herein, for the first time, we constructed the tungstate/perovskite heterointerface via a &#8220;two step&#8221; in situ reaction approach that provides effective defect passivation and ensures efficient carrier dynamics at the GBGs. The exposed perovskite at grain boundaries is converted to wide&#8208;band&#8208;gap PbWO4 via an in&#8208;situ reaction between Pb2+ and tungstate ions, which passivate defects due to the strong ionic bonding. Moreover, recombination loss is further suppressed via the heterointerface energetics modification based on an additional transformation from PbWO4 to CaWO4. PSCs based on this groove modification strategy showed good universality in both normal and inverted structure, with an improved efficiency of 23.25&#8201;% in the n&#8208;i&#8208;p device and 23.33&#8201;% in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device. Stable power output of the modified device could maintain 91.7&#8201;% after around 1100&#8197;h, and the device efficiency could retain 92.5&#8201;% after aging in air for around 2110&#8197;h, and 93.1&#8201;% after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C in N2 for 972&#8197;h.

         <title>Modulation of Colloidal Assembly Behavior Enables Printable Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved in perovskite frameworks is visualized by investigating the precursor species. The feasibility of modulating the quantum wells structure for the fabrication of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite photovoltaics is further verified.







Abstract
The multiple quantum wells (QWs) distribution in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films hinders charge transport due to the fundamental difficulty of controlling crystal growth from precursor solutions, yielding poorly homogeneous low&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially in upscaling fabrication. Here, efficient low&#8208;dimensional PSCs are realized by modulating the colloidal assembly behavior in the precursor solution to induce intermediate structures. In combination with in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, the assembly behavior of organic cations involved lead iodide&#8208;dominated colloidal soft framework is visualized by investigating the precursor species differences under hydrogen bonding interactions. Subsequently, solid&#8208;state reactions emerge and the formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite films exhibit significantly suppressed multiple QWs distribution. Encouragingly, the FA device (n=9, by meniscus&#8208;assisted coating) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.28&#8201;% for a size of 0.04&#8197;cm2 and a PCE of 15.35&#8201;% for a mini&#8208;module of 16.94&#8197;cm2 with superior stability.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable Metal Azolate Frameworks Showing Interesting Flexibilities for Highly Effective Bioethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As demonstrated by the extraordinary ethanol purification performances of a pore&#8208;opening adsorbent for various ethanol/water mixtures, the guest&#8208;dominated gating process, in which the preferentially&#8208;adsorbed guest serves as the gating component, is critical for achieving ultrahigh adsorption selectivity in large&#8208;pore adsorbents and avoiding the co&#8208;adsorption problem of pore&#8208;opening adsorbents.







Abstract
The ethanol/water separation challenge highlights the adsorption capacity/selectivity trade&#8208;off problem. We show that the target guest can serve as a gating component of the host to block the undesired guest, giving molecular sieving effect for the adsorbent possessing large pores. Two hydrophilic/water&#8208;stable metal azolate frameworks were designed to compare the effects of gating and pore&#8208;opening flexibility. Large amounts (up to 28.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) of ethanol with fuel&#8208;grade (99.5&#8201;%+) and even higher purities (99.9999&#8201;%+) can be produced in a single adsorption process from not only 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 but also 10&#8201;:&#8201;90 ethanol/water mixtures. More interestingly, the pore&#8208;opening adsorbent possessing large pore apertures showed not only high water adsorption capacity but also exceptionally high water/ethanol selectivity characteristic of molecular sieving. Computational simulations demonstrated the critical role of guest&#8208;anchoring aperture for the guest&#8208;dominated gating process.

         <title>Reversible Ammonium Ion Intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation with Crystal Water Promotion Effect in Layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O

VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O with a layered framework and two&#8208;dimensional channels has been demonstrated as the high&#8208;performance cathode material for aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, which delivered very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4&#8197;V and a high specific capacity of 154.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The crystal water in the layered host plays a key role in the structural stability and significantly promotes the NH4+ ion storage behavior.







Abstract
The non&#8208;metal NH4+ carrier has attracted tremendous interests for aqueous energy storage owing to its light molar mass and fast diffusion in aqueous electrolytes. Previous study inferred that NH4+ ion storage in layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O is impossible due to the removal of NH4+ from NH4VOPO4 leads to a phase change inevitably. Herein, we update this cognition and demonstrated highly reversible intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation behavior of NH4+ in layered VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O host. Satisfactory specific capacity of 154.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and very stable discharge potential plateau at 0.4&#8197;V based on reference electrode was achieved in VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O. A rocking&#8208;chair ammonium&#8208;ion full cell with the VOPO4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O//2.0&#8197;M NH4OTf//PTCDI configuration exhibited a specific capacity of 55&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, an average operating voltage of about 1.0&#8197;V and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability over 500&#8197;cycles with a coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99&#8201;%. Theoretical DFT calculations suggest a unique crystal water substitution process by ammonium ion during the intercalation process. Our results provide new insight into the intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of NH4+ ions in layered hydrated phosphates through crystal water enhancement effect.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Detection of Trace Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) exhibits significant and sensitive fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; behavior for benzene vapor by virtue of unique &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions, enabling visual detection of a trace level of benzene for the first time.







Abstract
Indoor detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration is necessary due to the serious toxicity hazards even at trace level. However, physisorbents usually exhibit weak interactions especially in the presence of trace concentrations of VOCs, thus exhibiting poor responsive signal. Herein, we report a new flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that exhibits interesting pore&#8208;opening behavior after immersing in H2O. The pore&#8208;opening phase shows significant (&#8776;116 folds) and extremely fast (&lt;1&#8197;minute) fluorescence enhancement after being exposed to saturated benzene vapor. The limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor can be calculated as 0.133&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. Thus this material represents the first MOF to achieve visual detection of trace benzene vapor by the naked eyes. Theoretical calculations and single&#8208;crystal structure reveal that the special &#8220;bilateral &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8221; interactions between the host and guest, which facilitate electron transfer and greatly enhance the intensity of fluorescence.

         <title>Photoinitiated Energy Transfer in Porous&#8208;Cage&#8208;Stabilised Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new material containing plasmonic silver nanoparticles was synthesized using only porphyrin&#8208;based porous organic cages as the ligand, which decorate the surface of the nanoparticle. The nanoparticle acts as a photosensitizer for the porphyrin cages by transferring its excited&#8208;state energy to the porphyrin. The photosensitization effect and porosity of the ligand enable superior photoelectrochemical water splitting compared to the individual components.







Abstract
We report a new composite material consisting of silver nanoparticles decorated with three&#8208;dimensional molecular organic cages based on light&#8208;absorbing porphyrins. The porphyrin cages serve to both stabilize the particles and allow diffusion and trapping of small molecules close to the metallic surface. Combining these two photoactive components results in a Fano&#8208;resonant interaction between the porphyrin Soret band and the nanoparticle&#8208;localised surface&#8208;plasmon resonance. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy revealed the silver nanoparticles transfer up to 37&#8201;% of their excited&#8208;state energy to the stabilising layer of porphyrin cages. These unusual photophysics cause a 2&#8208;fold current increase in photoelectrochemical water&#8208;splitting measurements. The composite structure provides a compelling proof of concept for advanced photosensitiser systems with intrinsic porosity for photocatalytic and sensing applications.

         <title>Linker Vacancy Engineering of a Robust ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;MOF for Hexane Isomers Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly robust ftw&#8208;type zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework has been constructed. Its linker vacancy sites are restored by post&#8208;synthetic linker insertion, which notably enhances its separation performance toward alkane isomers.







Abstract
Discrimination of physically similar molecules by porous solids represents an important yet challenging task in industrially relevant chemical separations. Precisely controlled pore dimension and/or tailored pore surface functionality are crucial to achieve high&#8208;efficiency separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for these challenging separations in light of their structural diversity as well as highly adjustable pore dimension/functionality. We report here a microporous, ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;based MOF structure, HIAM&#8208;410 (HIAM=Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials), built on hexanuclear Zr6 cluster and pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetracarboxylate (ptc4&#8722;). Its crystallographic structure has been determined using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique combined with Rietveld refinement against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, aided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. The compound features exceptional framework stability that is comparable to the prototype MOF UiO&#8208;66. Interestingly, the linker vacancies in the pristine MOF structure could be partially restored by post&#8208;synthetic linker insertion. Its separation capability of hexane isomers is enhanced substantially upon the linker vacancy engineering. The restored structure exhibits efficient splitting of monobranched and dibranched hexane isomers at both room temperature and industrially relevant temperature.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Polyhydroxylated Steroids by an Unsaturation&#8208;Functionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin were achieved from a key unsaturated steroidal skeleton in 14 and 15&#8197;steps overall, respectively, by employing an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy. The key unsaturated intermediate bearing a C19&#8208;hydroxy functionality was furnished in only four steps from a Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal through an efficient asymmetric dearomative cyclization reaction.







Abstract
Highly oxygenated cardiotonic steroids, such as ouabain, possess a wide spectrum of biological functions and remain significant synthetic challenges. Herein, we have applied an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy and developed a synthetic method in addressing the C19&#8208;hydroxylation issue for efficient synthesis of polyhydroxylated steroids. An effective asymmetric dearomative cyclization allowed the construction of the C19&#8208;hydroxy unsaturated steroidal skeleton in only four steps from the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal 7. The synthetic sequence featured C3&#8722;OH&#8208;directed hydrogenation/epoxidation, m&#8208;CPBA&#8208;triggered epoxidation/SN2&#8242; nucleophilic substitution, Birch reduction of an enone, and regioselective LiAlH4 reduction to furnish the polyhydroxy functionalities on the steroid skeleton with high stereochemical control and efficiency. This approach ultimately enabled the total synthesis of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin in 18 and 19 steps, respectively, overall. The synthesis of these polyhydroxylated steroids offers synthetic versatility and practicality in the search for new therapeutic agents.

         <title>Realizing Abundant Chirality Inversion of Supramolecular Nanohelices by Multiply Manipulating the Binding Sites in Molecular Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abundant chirality inversion has been realized by 1) manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives with different naphthalene derivatives (Mode&#8197;A or B), 2) synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives to simultaneously interact with two kinds of naphthalene derivatives (Mode&#8197;A+B), and 3) switching the interaction modes by varying solvent.







Abstract
The induction of diverse chirality regulation in nature by multiple binding sites of biomolecules is ubiquitous and plays an essential role in determining the biofunction of biosystems. However, mimicking this biological phenomenon and understanding at a molecular level its mechanism with the multiple binding sites by establishing an artificial system still remains a challenge. Herein, abundant chirality inversion is achieved by precisely and multiply manipulating the co&#8208;assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives (D/LPPF) with different naphthalene derivatives (NA, NC, NP, NF). The amide and hydroxy group of naphthalene derivatives prefer to bind with the carboxy group of LPPF, while carboxylic groups and fluoride atoms tend to bind with the amide moiety of LPPF. All these diverse interaction modes can precisely trigger helicity inversion of LPPF nanofibers. In addition, synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites from a single LPPF molecule to simultaneously interact with different naphthalene derivatives leads to chirality regulation. Typically, varying the solvent may switch the interaction modes and the switched new interaction modes can be employed to further regulate the chirality of the LPPF nanofibers. This study may provide a novel approach to explore chirality diversity in artificial systems by regulating the intermolecular binding sites.

Herein, abundant chirality inversion is achieved by precisely and multiply manipulating the co-assembled binding sites of phenylalanine derivatives (D/LPPF) with different naphthalene derivatives (NA, NC, NP, NF). The amide and hydroxy group of naphthalene derivatives prefer to bind with the carboxy group of LPPF, while carboxylic groups and fluoride atoms tend to bind with the amide moiety of LPPF. All these diverse interaction modes can precisely trigger helicity inversion of LPPF nanofibers. In addition, synergistically manipulating the carboxy and amide binding sites from a single LPPF molecule to simultaneously interact with different naphthalene derivatives leads to chirality regulation. Typically, varying the solvent may switch the interaction modes and the switched new interaction modes can be employed to further regulate the chirality of the LPPF nanofibers. This study may provide a novel approach to explore chirality diversity in artificial systems by regulating the intermolecular binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small&#8208;Bandgap Conjugated Polymers Based on an N&#8722;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homopolymer based on resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit exhibits ultra&#8208;small band gap of 0.82&#8197;eV and excellent stability. The selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property with high transparency in visible region makes the polymer suitable for transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass.







Abstract
Since the breakthrough of conductive polymers in 1977, scientists have made great efforts to create small band gap (Eg) conjugated polymers. Two general strategies to design small Eg conjugated polymers are quinoid structure and donor&#8208;acceptor structure. Ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers (Eg&lt;1.0&#8197;eV) always suffer from poor air stability because of high&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels. In this work, we report a new strategy to design ultrasmall Eg conjugated polymers by N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). The resulting polymer exhibits an Eg of 0.82&#8197;eV and an onset absorption wavelength of &gt;1500&#8197;nm. Moreover, the polymer exhibits excellent air stability because of its low&#8208;lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. An unprecedented property of this polymer is the selective light absorption in the infrared range (800&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) and high transparency in the visible range (400&#8211;780&#8197;nm). Using this property, for the first time, we demonstrate the application of conjugated polymers as transparent thermal&#8208;shielding coating layer on glass, which reduces indoor solar irradiation through window and consequently reduces power consumption for cooling of buildings and cars in summer.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photodynamic Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Therapy and Metastasis Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared photodynamic chemiluminescent probe (DBPOL) is designed to specifically detect the tumor biomarker lysyl oxidase (LOX) for chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) and follow&#8208;up monitoring of lung metastasis.







Abstract
There is growing interest in the development of chemiluminescence (CL) probes for phototheranostics because of their minimized tissue autofluorescence. However, due to a lack of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing chemiluminophores, current probes for NIR CL&#8208;guided phototherapy are based on nanoparticles made up of multiple components. We report bright unimolecular chemiluminophores with NIR absorptions and emissions, long CL half&#8208;lives and ideal photodynamic efficiency. One luminophore is modified into an activatable probe, DBPOL, with a turn&#8208;on CL signal and photodynamic activity that are specific to a cancer biomarker. The highly sensitive DBPOL allows CL&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy which completely inhibits tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse models, and can be applied for noninvasive monitoring of lung metastasis. We provide molecular guidelines for NIR&#8208;absorbing CL probes for imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy.

         <title>Shape&#8208; and Size&#8208;Tunable Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages through Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have established the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull internal alkynes. This reaction allows for the shape&#8208; and size&#8208;tunable synthesis of covalent organic cages (aryl ether cages) using push&#8208;pull internal diynes. Some aryl ether cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in their hydrophobic cavity by hydrogen bonding with the multiple ester moieties.







Abstract
Covalent organic cages have potential applications in molecular inclusion/recognition and porous organic crystals. Bridging arene units with sp3 atoms enables facile construction of rigid isolated internal vacancies, and various prismatic arene cages have been synthesized by kinetically controlled covalent bond formation. However, the synthesis of a tetrahedral one, which requires twice as much bond formation as prismatic ones, has been limited to a thermodynamically controlled dynamic SNAr reaction, and this reversible covalent bond formation made the resulting cage product chemically unstable. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;yielding and highly 1,3,5&#8208;selective room temperature [2+2+2] cycloaddition of push&#8208;pull alkynes and its application to the synthesis of chemically stable aryl ether cages of various shapes and sizes, including prismatic and tetrahedral forms. These aryl ether cages are highly crystalline and intertwine with each other to form regular packing structures. Some aryl ether cages encapsulated isolated water molecules in their hydrophobic cavity by hydrogen bonding with the multiple ester moieties.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;phase WO3 Cocatalysts on Hierarchical Si&#8208;based Photocathode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Li Extraction</title>

         <dc:description>
Hierarchical silicon&#8208;based photocathodes with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide cocatalysts achieve a highly efficient yield rate of metallic lithium and an excellent faradaic efficiency. This work provides a new strategy for the green extraction of waste lithium and the utilization of solar energy.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical lithium (Li) extraction can be expected to provide a useful recycle of Li+ from waste Li&#8208;containing battery, but the process is limited by the photocathodes with poor Li+ absorption and low yield rate. Here, we have designed a hierarchical silicon (Si)&#8208;based photocathode with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide (WO3) cocatalysts for photoelectrochemical Li extraction under 1 sun illumination, achieving a high Li yield rate of &#8776;223.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 91.9&#8201;% at 0.0817&#8197;V versus Li0/+ redox couple. The WO3 cocatalysts with the mixture of amorphous and crystalline phase accelerates the Li+ insertion and precipitation and enriches the concentration of Li+ at the photocathode surface. This robust photoelectrochemical Li extraction system provides a new insight on designing green and efficient route for cyclic utilization of Li resources in the sustainable energy field.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt Nanoparticles: Phase&#8208;Controlled Synthesis and Performance in Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered mesoporous intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles, including Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic phase and Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic phase, were successfully synthesized by a concurrent template method in presence of different Ga sources. The resulting mesoporous intermetallic Ga&#8208;Pt disclosed remarkably phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction electrocatalysis, with unexpected high activity of Ga1Pt1 compared to the Ga3Pt5 counterpart.







Abstract
The intermetallic phase control is a promising strategy to optimize the physicochemical properties of ordered intermetallic compounds and engineer their performance in various (electro)catalytic reactions. However, the intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance is still rarely reported because of the difficulty in synthesizing ordered intermetallics with precisely controlled phase structures at atomic level, especially having ordered mesoscopic structure/morphology. Here, we successfully reported a precise synthesis of two phase&#8208;pure mesoporous intermetallic gallium&#8208;platinum (meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt) nanoparticles, including meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 with an orthorhombic space group and meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 with a non&#8208;symmorphic chiral cubic space group. The intermetallic phase control of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt nanoparticles was realized by carefully tuning the induced Ga salts with different anions that optimized the free energies during the synthesis. The intermetallic phase&#8208;dependent catalytic performance of ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga&#8208;Pt was systematically evaluated for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis, with completely opposite catalytic performance in alkaline media. Interestingly, ordered meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga1Pt1 catalyst with chiral atomic arrangements disclosed unexpected high ORR activity and stability with 5.9 and 3.2 enhancement factors in mass activity compared to those of meso&#8208;i&#8208;Ga3Pt5 and commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Exploiting Reusable Edge&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Free Polyphthalocyanine Networks for Efficient Polymer Synthesis at Near Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screening of various edge&#8208;functionalities, naphthyl&#8208;edged polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc&#8208;n) are discovered with promising catalytic performance to promote efficient polymer synthesis. The metal&#8208;free PPc&#8208;n is suitable for rapid and controlled photopolymerization of various monomers under NIR light irradiation with high monomer conversions and excellent recyclable stability.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are highly advantageous for industrial applications owing to their distinctive merits including easy separation and effective recovery. However, utilizing heterogeneous photocatalysts to harness longer wavelength light remains a critical area of research. This contribution explores the use of edge&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free polyphthalocyanine networks (PPc&#8208;x) to promote efficient polymer synthesis under near infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Our screening process revealed that both phenyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;p) and naphthyl&#8208;edged PPc&#8208;x (PPc&#8208;n) offer promising performance for photopolymerization. With the assistance of ppm&#8208;level PPc&#8208;n catalyst, well&#8208;defined polymers were synthesized within a few hours under the regulation of three NIR lights, regardless of shielded by synthetic and biological barriers. An excellent control over the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution was achieved. Furthermore, PPc&#8208;x can be easily recovered and reused for multiple cycles, with negligible leaching and maintenance of the catalytic performance. This study expands a new avenue in developing versatile photocatalysts for the modern synthetic toolkits and offer benefits in diverse applications.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Unactivated Alkenes via Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Regioselective Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective catalysis using a chiral nickel complex has been developed via kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes. This hydroamination protocol produces a wide range of syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives derivatives and &#945;&#8208;alkylated unconjugated carbonyl olefins with high enantiomeric purity.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution is a powerful strategy for the isolation of enantioenriched compounds from racemic mixtures, and the development of selective catalytic processes is an active area of research. Here, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes via the enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselective hydroamination. This protocol affords both chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted butenamides and syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantiomeric purity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and selectivity factor up to &gt;684. The key to the excellent kinetic resolution efficiency is the distinctive architecture of the chiral nickel complex, which enables successful resolution and enantioselective C&#8722;N bond construction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the unique structure of the chiral ligand facilitates a rapid migratory insertion step with one enantiomer. This strategy provides a practical and versatile approach to prepare a wide range of chiral compounds.

         <title>DOPA Residues Endow Collagen with Radical Scavenging Capacity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bound dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is a component of tendon and meniscus tissue and originates from tyrosine oxidation. Both in situ and in vitro, DOPA proved to be a highly efficient radical scavenger, with the products of radical degradation being hydrogen peroxide and DOPA quinone. Thus, we suggest that the DOPA pathway is part of a tissue&#8208;inherent redox buffer system.







Abstract
Here we uncover collagen, the main structural protein of all connective tissues, as a redox&#8208;active material. We identify dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues, post&#8208;translational oxidation products of tyrosine residues, to be common in collagen derived from different connective tissues. We observe that these DOPA residues endow collagen with substantial radical scavenging capacity. When reducing radicals, DOPA residues work as redox relay: they convert to the quinone and generate hydrogen peroxide. In this dual function, DOPA outcompetes its amino acid precursors and ascorbic acid. Our results establish DOPA residues as redox&#8208;active side chains of collagens, probably protecting connective tissues against radicals formed under mechanical stress and/or inflammation.

         <title>Multi&#8208;layer 3D Chirality and Double&#8208;Helical Assembly in a Copper Nanocluster with a Triple&#8208;Helical Cu15 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;precise copper nanocluster containing a chiral triple&#8208;stranded helical core has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The nanocluster shows unique multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality and assembles into double&#8208;helical secondary structure with emergent distinct optical and catalytic properties.







Abstract
Conceptually mimicking biomolecules&#8217; ability to construct multiple&#8208;helical aggregates with emergent properties and functions remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here we report an atom&#8208;precise 18&#8208;copper nanocluster (NC), Cu18H(PET)14(TPP)6(NCS)3 (Cu18H) which contains a pseudo D3&#8208;symmetrical triple&#8208;helical Cu15 core. Structurally, Cu18H may be also viewed as sandwich type of sulfur&#8208;bridged chiral copper cluster units [Cu6&#8722;Cu6&#8722;Cu6], endowing three&#8208;layered 3D chirality. More importantly, the chiral NCs are aggregated into an infinite double&#8208;stranded helix supported by intra&#8208;strand homonuclear C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C dihydrogen contacts and inter&#8208;strand C&#8722;H/&#960; and C&#8722;H/S interactions. The unique multi&#8208;layered 3D chirality and the double&#8208;helical assembly of Cu18H are evocative of DNA. Moreover, the collective behaviours of the aggregated NCs not only exhibit crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effects in the deep&#8208;red region, but also efficiently catalyze electron transfer (ET) reaction. This study thus presents that hierarchical assemblies of atomically defined copper NCs could be intricate as observed for important biomolecules like DNA with emergent properties arising from aggregated behaviours.

&lt;p&gt;An atom-precise copper nanocluster containing a chiral triple-stranded helical core has been synthesized and structurally characterized. The nanocluster shows unique multi-layer 3D chirality and assembles into double-helical secondary structure with emergent distinct optical and catalytic properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually mimicking biomolecules&#8217; ability to construct multiple-helical aggregates with emergent properties and functions remains a long-standing challenge. Here we report an atom-precise 18-copper nanocluster (NC), Cu&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H(PET)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(TPP)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(NCS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;) which contains a pseudo &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical triple-helical Cu&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; core. Structurally, &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; may be also viewed as sandwich type of sulfur-bridged chiral copper cluster units [Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], endowing three-layered 3D chirality. More importantly, the chiral NCs are aggregated into an infinite double-stranded helix supported by intra-strand homonuclear C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C dihydrogen contacts and inter-strand C&#8722;H/&#960; and C&#8722;H/S interactions. The unique multi-layered 3D chirality and the double-helical assembly of &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; are evocative of DNA. Moreover, the collective behaviours of the aggregated NCs not only exhibit crystallization-induced emission enhancement (CIEE) and aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) effects in the deep-red region, but also efficiently catalyze electron transfer (ET) reaction. This study thus presents that hierarchical assemblies of atomically defined copper NCs could be intricate as observed for important biomolecules like DNA with emergent properties arising from aggregated behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A ruthenium&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by 760 nm NIR light via single&#8208;photon pathway is reported by Xuezhao Li, Wen Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218768). The photocage was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers, forming nanoparticles via self&#8208;assembly, which release the ruthenium complex&#8208;based photocages to inhibit tumor proliferation in vivo upon exposure to NIR light.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging is a powerful technique. In their Research Article (e202300682), Sebastian Kruss et&#8197;al. used single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as fluorescent probes/sensors for biomolecules in the near infrared (NIR) tissue transparency window. The SWCNTs were functionalized with DNA to render them selective for the important neurotransmitter dopamine. Time correlated single photon counting in a confocal microscope was used to read out fluorescence lifetime, which changed with dopamine concentration. This approach enabled the measurement of dopamine around cells. Thus, the fluorescence lifetime of SWCNTs becomes a new sensing strategy for bio(molecules).

Allylation. In their Communication (e202301839), Lukas J. Goo&#223;en et&#8197;al. report a simple manganese catalyst for the ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation of benzoic acids. The reaction can be combined with an in situ decarboxylation, giving access to allylarenes in substitution patterns that are otherwise hard to obtain.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers successfully implemented the key features of the natural enzyme CO dehydrogenase in an iron porphyrin architecture and designed a catalyst that allowed facile and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 products is challenging, as the thermodynamic reduction potentials for the different n&#8201;e&#8722;/n&#8201;H+ reductions of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers have taken inspiration from the active site of nickel CO dehydrogenase (Ni&#8208;CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by a urea moiety. These complexes show fast and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and the results suggest a Ni&#8208;CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metals binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilizes the reduced species by forming a bridged complex, facilitating the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free NiOx Nanocrystals: A Low&#8208;cost and Stable Hole Transport Material for Commercializing Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dopant&#8208;free non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective hole transport material in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, Zhang et&#8197;al. summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs and their applications in different perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Advancing inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for commercial applications given their compatibility with different bottom cells for tandem photovoltaics, low&#8208;temperature processability (&#8804;100&#8201;&#176;C), and promising operational stability. Although inverted PSCs have achieved an efficiency of over 25&#8201;% using doped or expensive organic hole transport materials (HTMs), their synthesis cost and stability still cannot meet the requirements for their commercialization. Recently, dopant&#8208;free and low&#8208;cost non&#8208;stoichiometric nickel oxide nanocrystals (NiOx NCs) have been extensively studied as a low&#8208;cost and effective HTM in perovskite optoelectronics. In this minireview, we summarize the synthesis and surface&#8208;functionalization methods of NiOx NCs. Then, the applications of NiOx NCs in other perovskite optoelectronics beyond photovoltaics are discussed. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future development of NiOx NCs for the commercialization of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions through Sulfur&#8208;Anchoring of Metal Catalysts on Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomena, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI phenomena made it possible to synthesize a variety of catalysts with enhanced performance.







Abstract
In supported metal catalysts, the supports would strongly interact with the metal components instead of just acting as a carrier, which greatly affects both of their synthesis and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. Carbon is considered as very important but inert support and thus hard to induce strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This mini&#8208;review highlights that sulfur&#8212;a documented poison reagent for metal catalysts&#8212;when doped in a carbon supports can induce diverse SMSI phenomenon, including electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), classic SMSI, and reactive metal&#8208;support interaction (RMSI). These SMSI between metal and sulfur&#8208;doped carbon (S&#8722;C) supports enables the catalysts with extraordinary resistance to sintering at high temperatures of up to 1100&#8201;&#176;C, which allows the general synthesis of single&#8208;atom, alloy cluster, and intermetallic compound catalysts with high dispersion and metal loading for a variety of applications.

This review proposes an integrated descriptor, Li+ transport throughput (
), to evaluate the practical properties of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;based batteries. We highlight three key aspects to realize high 
, via creating highly efficient cross&#8208;phase, cross&#8208;gap and cross&#8208;interface ion transport in solid&#8208;state battery systems.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, there still lacks an evaluation criterion to estimate real research status and compare overall performance of the developed SSLMBs. Herein, we propose a comprehensive descriptor, Li+ transport throughput (
), to estimate actual conditions and output performance of the SSLMBs. The 
 is defined as molar number of Li+ passing through unit area of electrode/electrolyte interface in an hour (mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) during cycling of battery, which is a quantizable value after taking complex aspects including cycle rate, electrode areal capacity and polarization into account. On this basis, we evaluate the 
 of liquid, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state and solid&#8208;state batteries, and highlight three key aspects to achieve high value of 
 via building highly efficient cross&#8208;phase, cross&#8208;gap and cross&#8208;interface ion transport in the solid&#8208;state battery systems. We believe that the new concept of 
 provides milestone guidelines towards large&#8208;scale commercialization of SSLMBs.

         <title>Charge Makes a Difference: Molecular Ionic Bismuth Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged molecular bismuth species encompass cationic and anionic complexes with organic and inorganic ligand spheres as well as ligand&#8208;free molecular clusters. This review provides an overview of their syntheses, structures, and bonding modes. It outlines how the heavy metal bismuth, with its capability of forming non&#8208;toxic compounds, can be understood as the key towards unique reactivity and sustainable applications.







Abstract
Key challenges in modern synthetic chemistry include the design of reliable, selective, and more sustainable synthetic methods, as well as the development of promising candidates for new materials. Molecular bismuth compounds offer valuable opportunities as they show an intriguing spectrum of properties that is yet to be fully exploited: a soft character, a rich coordination chemistry, the availability of a broad variety of oxidation states (at least +V to &#8722;I) and formal charges (at least +3 to &#8722;3) at the Bi atoms, and reversible switching between multiple oxidation states. All this is paired with the status of a non&#8208;precious (semi&#8722;)metal of good availability and a tendency towards low toxicity. Recent findings show that some of these properties only come into reach, or can be substantially optimized, when charged compounds are specifically addressed. In this review, essential contributions to the synthesis, analyses, and utilization of ionic bismuth compounds are highlighted.

A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition/enantioselective protonation with selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides is disclosed, which affords a series of chiral selenides in high to excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition/protonation with selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides is disclosed, which affords a series of chiral selenides in high to excellent enantioselectivity. As for both selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, the reaction enjoys broad substrate scopes. The present catalytic system is also successfully applied to asymmetric selenation of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. A [Cu&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;TANIAPHOS]&#8208;SePh species is characterized by its 77Se NMR spectra, which gives a chemical shift at &#948; 462&#8197;ppm. Moreover, a {[Cu&#8208;(R)&#8208;TOL&#8208;BINAP]&#8208;SePh}2 species is characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, which confirms the formation of Cu&#8722;Se bond in the reaction. Finally, the transformations of the thioamide group to amine and thioester are demonstrated to be straightforward.

         <title>Nanobody Loop Mimetics Enhance Son of Sevenless 1&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleotide Exchange on RAS
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptides based on the interacting loop of a nanobody were designed as downsized mimetics, by considering interactions with the RAS&#8201;:&#8201;son of sevenless&#8197;1 (SOS1) protein complex observed in their co&#8208;crystal structure. A biochemical assay, flanked by X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures and kinetic studies, demonstrated the modulation of nucleotide exchange activity of the RAS&#8201;:&#8201;SOS1 complex, together with high structural mimicry of the nanobody paratope.







Abstract
RAS proteins control various intracellular signaling networks. Mutations at specific locations were shown to stabilize their active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)&#8208;bound state, which is associated with the development of multiple cancers. An attractive approach to modulate RAS signaling is through its regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) son of sevenless 1 (SOS1). With the recent discovery of Nanobody14 (Nb14), which potently enhances SOS1&#8208;catalyzed nucleotide exchange on RAS, we explored the feasibility of developing peptide mimetics by structurally mimicking the complementarity&#8208;determining region&#8197;3 (CDR3). Guided by a biochemical GEF assay and X&#8208;ray co&#8208;crystal structures, successive rounds of optimization and gradual conformational rigidification led to CDR3 mimetics showing half of the maximal activation potential of Nb14 with an EC50 value of 29&#8197;&#956;M. Altogether, this study demonstrated that peptides able to modulate a protein&#8208;protein interaction can be obtained by structural mimicry of a Nb paratope.

         <title>Uniform Growth of Nanocrystalline ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;on Cellulose Nanocrystals: Useful Template for Microporous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) formed a ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure by sequential synthesis of a metal organic framework (MOF) on the surface of CNCs then a microporous organic polymer (MOP) on the surface of ZIF@CNC composites. The CNC materials functionalized with MOPs and ZIF&#8208;8 showed excellent catalytic performance in CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals were uniformly grown on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to give a hybrid material, ZIF@CNCs. By varying the stoichiometry of the components, it was possible to control the size of the ZIF&#8208;8 crystals grown on the CNC surface. Optimized ZIF@CNC (ZIF@CNC&#8208;2) was used as a template to synthesize a microporous organic polymer (MOP), ZIF@MOP@CNC. After etching the ZIF&#8208;8 with 6&#8197;M HCl solution, a MOP material with encapsulated CNCs (MOP@CNC) was formed. Zinc coordination into the porphyrin unit of the MOP yielded the ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle structure, Zn MOP@CNC, comprised of CNCs encapsulated within the Zn&#8208;MOP. In comparison to ZIF@CNC&#8208;2, Zn MOP@CNC showed better catalytic activity and chemical stability for CO2 fixation, converting epichlorohydrin to chloroethylene carbonate. This work demonstrates a novel approach to create porous materials through CNC templating.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Exchange by Homogeneous Iridium Catalysis in Aqueous Buffers with Deuterium or Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed, highly selective, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) in water or buffers is a new powerful tool for deuterium or tritium labelling of highly polar compounds and aqueous formulated targets.







Abstract
We have studied the highly selective homogeneous iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) with deuterium or tritium gas as an isotope source in water and buffers. With an improved water&#8208;soluble Kerr&#8208;type catalyst, we have achieved the first insight into applying HIE reactions in aqueous media with varying pH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations gave consistent insights in the calculated energies of transition states and coordination complexes, further explaining the observed reactivity and guidance on the scope and limitations for HIE reactions in water. Finally, we successfully adapted these findings to tritium chemistry.

With an improved water-soluble Kerr-type catalyst, we have achieved the first insight into applying HIE reactions in aqueous media with varying pH. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations gave consistent insights in the calculated energies of transition states and coordination complexes, further explaining the observed reactivity and guidance on the scope and limitations for HIE reactions in water. Finally, we successfully adapted these findings to tritium chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supercooled Liquids with Dynamic Room Temperature Phosphorescence Using Terminal Hydroxyl Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise strategy to develop a series of stable supercooled liquids (SCLs) is presented. The SCLs exhibit repeatable dynamic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence behavior by alternating stimulation with UV light and heat. This unique luminescence behavior is applied to demonstrate erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates.







Abstract
Dynamic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics, which inevitably suffer from poor processability, flexibility or stretchability. Herein, we report a concise strategy to develop supercooled liquids (SCLs) with dynamic RTP behavior using terminal hydroxyl engineering. The terminal hydroxyls effectively hinder the nucleation process of molecules for the formation of stable SCLs after thermal annealing. Impressively, the SCLs show reversible RTP emission via alternant stimulation by UV light and heat. Photoactivated SCLs have phosphorescent efficiency of 8.50&#8201;% and a lifetime of 31.54&#8197;ms under ambient conditions. Regarding the dynamic RTP behavior and stretchability of SCLs, we demonstrate the applications in erasable data encryption and patterns on flexible substrates. This finding provides a design principle for obtaining SCLs with RTP and expands the potential applications of RTP materials in flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Manganese(I) Catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H Allylation of Benzoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple manganese catalyst sets new standards in the ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation of benzoates, by allowing nearly complete selectivity for mono&#8208; over competing di&#8208;allylation. The reaction can be combined with an in situ decarboxylation, giving access to allylarenes in substitution patterns that are otherwise hard to obtain. The scope of the protocol is demonstrated by 44 diverse examples.







Abstract
The 3d&#8208;metal catalyst Mn(CO)5Br was found to efficiently promote ortho C&#8722;H allylations of arenecarboxylates in the presence of neocuproine as the ligand. Despite the simplicity of directing group and catalyst system, the selectivity goes well beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in that mono&#8208;allylated products are obtained exclusively with high selectivities for the least hindered ortho&#8208;position. The directing group can optionally be removed by in situ decarboxylation, opening up a regioselective entry to allyl arenes. The preparative utility of the process and its othogonality to other approaches was demonstrated by 44 products with otherwise hard&#8208;to&#8208;access substitution patterns, including 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;allylbenzene, 3&#8208;allylbenzofuran, or 5&#8208;allyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylnitrobenzene.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of cis&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinoids

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed and biomimetic cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl terpenols as a platform strategy for the synthesis of &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinoids is described. This synthesis features the most direct synthetic access to this product class and requires only 3 steps from readily available precursors with exceptionally low catalyst loadings of as low as 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% (MOM=methoxymethyl, IDPi=imidodiphosphorimidates).







Abstract
We report herein the catalytic asymmetric cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl terpenols to afford enantiomerically highly enriched &#916;9&#8208;cis&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinoid scaffolds in a single step. As powerful chiral catalysts strongly acidic imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPis) have been identified which furnish the products with good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Upon MOM&#8208;deprotection some naturally occurring cannabimimetica such as (&#8722;)&#8208;cis&#8208;&#916;9&#8208;tetrahydrocannabinol and (&#8722;)&#8208;perrottetinene as well as some unnatural analogues were made accessible along a merely 3&#8208;step biomimetic sequence (MOM=methoxymethyl).

         <title>Peroxygenase&#8208;Catalysed Selective Oxidation of Silanes to Silanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) efficiently hydroxylates organosilanes to the corresponding silanols. The methodology proposed here excels by its simplicity and high productivity. Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (PELE) simulations provide a rationale for the selectivities observed and put the basis for future AaeUPO engineering.







Abstract
A peroxygenase&#8208;catalysed hydroxylation of organosilanes is reported. The recombinant peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) enabled efficient conversion of a broad range of silane starting materials in attractive productivities (up to 300&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1), catalyst performance (up to 84&#8197;s&#8722;1 and more than 120&#8201;000 catalytic turnovers). Molecular modelling of the enzyme&#8208;substrate interaction puts a basis for the mechanistic understanding of AaeUPO selectivity.

         <title>Catalytic SNAr Hexafluoroisopropoxylation of Aryl Chlorides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyzed SNAr hexafluoroisopropoxylation of unactivated aryl chlorides and bromides was demonstrated. The catalyst activates the aromatic ring via &#951;6&#8208;coordination, dramatically facilitating the attack by weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol. Given that fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules, this method might find utility in medicinal and agricultural chemistry.







Abstract
Fluoroalkyl aryl ethers are valuable structural motifs in pharmaceuticals because compounds with these motifs are more metabolically stable and more lipophilic than their nonfluorinated analogues. However, hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers have not been extensively studied, presumably because of the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we describe a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitution of aryl chlorides or bromides, which act as the limiting reagents, with weakly nucleophilic hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol under mild reaction conditions. This method provides diverse hexafluoroisopropyl aryl ethers. We demonstrated the generality of this method by carrying out reactions of a large array of unactivated aryl halides, and we found that the success of the reactions relied on arene activation by means of &#951;6&#8208;coordination.

We demonstrated the generality of this method by carrying out reactions of a large array of unactivated aryl halides, and we found that the success of the reactions relied on arene activation by means of &#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective In Situ Analysis of Mature microRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles Using a DNA Cage&#8208;Based Thermophoretic Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging cancer biomarkers. Here we devised a DNA cage&#8208;based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs. This assay reached a limit of detection of 2.05&#8197;fM for mature miRNAs in EVs without the interference of pre&#8208;miRNAs, and an overall accuracy of 90&#8201;% for discriminating breast cancer patients and healthy donors.







Abstract
Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in different stages of cancer progression, yet it remains challenging to precisely detect mature miRNAs in EVs due to the presence of interfering RNAs (such as longer precursor miRNAs, pre&#8208;miRNAs) and the low abundance of tumor&#8208;associated miRNAs. By leveraging the size&#8208;selective ability of DNA cages and polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs, we devised a DNA cage&#8208;based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs with a low limit of detection (LoD) of 2.05&#8197;fM. Our assay can profile EV mature miRNAs directly in serum samples without the interference of pre&#8208;miRNAs and the need for ultracentrifugation. A clinical study showed that EV miR&#8208;21 or miR&#8208;155 had an overall accuracy of 90&#8201;% for discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy donors, which outperformed conventional molecular probes detecting both mature miRNAs and pre&#8208;miRNAs. We envision that our assay can advance EV miRNA&#8208;based diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Formyl Alkylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free protocol for the coupling reaction of aldehydes and alkyl halides was successfully developed with mesoionic carbenes (MICs) as catalysts. This versatile strategy delivers a large diversity of simple ketones as well as bio&#8208;active molecules by late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Ketones are among the most useful functional groups in organic synthesis, and they are commonly encountered in a broad range of compounds with various applications. Herein, we describe the mesoionic carbene&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of aldehydes with non&#8208;activated secondary and even primary alkyl halides. This metal&#8208;free method utilizes deprotonated Breslow intermediates derived from mesoionic carbenes (MICs), which act as super electron donors and induce the single&#8208;electron reduction of alkyl halides. This mild coupling reaction has a broad substrate scope and tolerates many functional groups, which allows to prepare a diversity of simple ketones as well as bio&#8208;active molecules by late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>Efficient Transformation of Polymer Main Chain Catalyzed by Macrocycle Metal Complexes via Pseudorotaxane Intermediate</title>

Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effect. Here, we show macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient transformation of main chain in polymer substrate, whereby higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Mechanistic studies suggest the reactions proceed via the formation of a pseudorotaxane intermediate.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis modification of polymers streamlines the synthesis of functionalized polymers, but is often incomplete due to the negative polymer effects. Developing efficient polymer reactions in artificial systems thus represents a long&#8208;standing objective in the fields of polymer and material science. Here, we show unprecedented macrocycle&#8208;metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed systems for efficient polymer reaction that result in 100&#8201;% transformation of the main chain functional groups presumably via a processive mode reaction. The complete polymer reactions were confirmed in not only intramolecular reaction (hydroamination) but also intermolecular reaction (hydrosilylation) by using Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;catalyzed systems. The most fascinating feature of the both reactions is that higher&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers reach completion faster. Various studies suggested that the reactions occur in the catalyst cavity via the formation of a supramolecular complex between the macrocycle catalyst and polymer substrate like pseudorotaxane, which should be of characteristic of the efficient polymer reactions progressing in a processive mode.

         <title>Combining MN6 Octahedra and PN5 Trigonal Bipyramids in the Mica&#8208;like Nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M=Al, In)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered silicate minerals are extremely versatile. The mica&#8208;like nitrides MP6N11 (M=Al, In) presented herein, containing the rare structural motifs of PN5 trigonal pyramids and MN6 octahedra, expand the sparse topic of nitridic layered silicate analogues. This opens a new field of research mimicking natural abundant minerals, promising a vast amount of new nitrides with intriguing materials properties.







Abstract
Layered silicates are a very versatile class of materials with high importance to humanity. The new nitridophosphates MP6N11 (M=Al, In), synthesized from MCl3, P3N5 and NH4N3 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction at 1100&#8201;&#176;C and 8&#8197;GPa, show a mica&#8208;like layer setup and feature rare nitrogen coordination motifs. The crystal structure of AlP6N11 was elucidated from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal diffraction data (space group Cm (no. 8), a=4.9354(10), b=8.1608(16), c=9.0401(18)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=98.63(3)&#176;), enabling Rietveld refinement of isotypic InP6N11. It is built up from layers of PN4 tetrahedra, PN5 trigonal bipyramids and MN6 octahedra. PN5 trigonal bipyramids have been reported only once and MN6 octahedra are sparsely found in the literature. AlP6N11 was further characterized by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX), IR and NMR spectroscopy. Despite the vast amount of known layered silicates, there is no isostructural compound to MP6N11 as yet.

         <title>Braided Fiber Current Collectors for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A multi&#8208;channel fiber current collector with both high electrical conductivity and loading content of active materials has been designed to produce fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy densities.







Abstract
Fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising power strategy for the rising wearable electronics. However, most fiber current collectors are solid with vastly increased weights of inactive materials and sluggish charge transport, thus resulting in low energy densities which have hindered the development of fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries in the past decade. Here, a braided fiber current collector with multiple channels was prepared by multi&#8208;axial winding method to not only increase the mass fraction of active materials, but also to promote ion transport along fiber electrodes. In comparison to typical solid copper wires, the braided fiber current collector hosted 139&#8201;% graphite with only 1/3 mass. The fiber graphite anode with braided current collector delivered high specific capacity of 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the overall electrode weight, which was 2 times higher than that of its counterpart solid copper wire. The resulting fiber battery showed high energy density of 62&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of Cleavable Polymers via Oxidation of Thioether Moieties and Thiol Click Reactions: A Click&#8208;Declick Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Block copolymers and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by click reactions. The polymer chains are cleaved by declick reactions between the oxidized thioethers on the polymer structures and the added thiol compounds.







Abstract
In the past decades click chemistries including thiol chemistries have found wide applications in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polymers. In this research, a click&#8208;declick strategy based on the oxidation of heteroaromatic thioethers and the substitution reactions between the oxidized groups and thiols, is proposed for the synthesis of the cleavable polymers. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, block copolymers (BCPs) and star&#8208;like polymers are synthesized by thiol&#8208;phenylsulfone substitution reactions, and heteroaromatic thioethers are produced at the junction points of the BCP chains or on the crosslinking sites of the star&#8208;like polymer. The thioethers can be oxidized to heteroaromatic sulfoxides or sulfones, depending on the oxidization condition. It is demonstrated that both sulfoxides or sulfones can have base catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reactions with thiols, leading to the cleavage of the polymers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lucidumone through Convenient One&#8208;pot Preparation of the Tetracyclic Skeleton by Claisen Rearrangement and Subsequent Intramolecular Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique strategy for the synthesis of lucidumone is described. Key transformation is a one&#8208;pot construction of a complex tetracyclic skeleton using a sequential Claisen rearrangement and an intramolecular aldol reaction. Other key features are stereocontrolled manipulations of functional groups on the bicyclo structure and efficient ether cyclization. An enantioselective synthesis is also described via a chiral transfer strategy in the Claisen rearrangement.







Abstract
The total synthesis of lucidumone (1), a Ganoderma meroterpenoid, was accomplished in racemic form from easily prepared 6 and 7 in 10 steps as the longest linear sequence. The synthesis was completed through one&#8208;pot preparation of the tetracyclic core skeleton by Claisen rearrangement followed by an intramolecular aldol reaction. The intramolecular aldol reaction allowed for the stereocontrolled construction of the bicyclo [2.2.2] octane skeleton fused to an indanone structure. The enantioselective total synthesis of 1 was also described via a chiral transfer strategy in the Claisen rearrangement.

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Potential&#8208;Driven Dissociation of N&#8208;Heterocycle/BF3 Adducts: A Possible Manifestation of the Electro&#8208;Inductive Effect</title>

         <dc:description>
In a non&#8208;redox fashion, applied potential dissociates acid&#8208;base N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 couples in the diffusion layer near an electrode. This effect was probed using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Recently, non&#8208;Faradaic effects were used to modify the electronic structure and reactivity of electrode&#8208;bound species. We hypothesize that these electrostatic perturbations could influence the chemical reactivity of electrolyte species near an electrode in the absence of Faradaic electron transfer. A prime example of non&#8208;Faradaic effects is acid&#8208;base dissociation near an interface. Here, we probed the near&#8208;electrode dissociation of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;BF3 Lewis adducts upon electrode polarization, well outside of the redox potential window of the adducts. Using scanning electrochemical microscopy and confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, we detected a potential&#8208;dependent depletion of the adduct near the electrode. We propose an electro&#8208;inductive effect where a more positive potential leads to electron withdrawal on the N&#8208;heterocycle. This study takes a step forward in the use of electrostatics at electrochemical interfaces for field&#8208;driven electrocatalytic and electro&#8208;synthetic processes.

         <title>Cooperative Sensitization Upconversion in Solution Dispersions of Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies of Mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 24, June 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Eu3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion from Eu3+ in non&#8208;deuterated solution dispersions. Upconversion quantum yields of 0.67&#8201;% were obtained under 980&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Lanthanide upconversion luminescence in nanoparticles has prompted continuous breakthroughs in information storage, temperature sensing, and biomedical applications, among others. Achieving upconversion luminescence at the molecular scale is still a critical challenge in modern chemistry. In this work, we explored the upconversion luminescence of solution dispersions of co&#8208;crystals composed of discrete mononuclear Yb(DBM)3Bpy and Eu(DBM)3Bpy complexes (DBM: dibenzoylmethane, Bpy: 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine). The 613&#8197;nm emission of Eu3+ was observed under excitation of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. From the series of molecular assemblies studied, the most intense luminescence was obtained for a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio of Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;Eu3+, resulting in a high quantum yield of 0.67&#8201;% at 2.1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The structure and energy transfer mechanism of the assemblies were fully characterized. This is the first example of an Eu3+&#8208;based upconverting system composed of two discrete mononuclear lanthanide complexes present as co&#8208;crystals in non&#8208;deuterated solution.
