      <title>Exploring a Fatigue&#8208;Free Layered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric for Photovoltaic Non&#8208;Volatile Memories</title>
      <dc:description>Ferroelectric materials, equipping a striking bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), have shown great potential for the next generation photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. However, further applications of conventional ferroelectric materials are hindered by their poor performance. The family of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics combining fascinating polarization and striking semiconducting properties presents significant possibilities. Herein, through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C  6  H  5  CH  2  NH  3  )  2  CsPb  2  Br  7&#160;  (  BCPB  ) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (  P  s  ) of 6.5 &#956;C/cm  2  and high Curie temperature up to 425 K. Meanwhile,  BCPB  shows splendid BPVE properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A/cm  2  ), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;10  5  ); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO  3  . Particularly, the unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of  P  s  and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 10  8  polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of  BCPB  in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. As a pioneering work, it offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well&#8208;known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50&#8208;70 vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the &#960;&#8208;surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.</dc:description>

      <title>Carboxylic Acid Reductase Can Catalyze Ester Synthesis in Aqueous Environments</title>
      <dc:description>Enzymatic esterification reactions under aqueous conditions are not common, as most of the well&#8208;known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity.&#160;This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR),&#160;an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg  2+  , and NADPH as co&#8208;substrates. When NADPH was replaced by a nucleophilic alcohol, CAR from&#160;  Mycobacterium marinum  can catalyze esterification under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Addition of imidazole, especially at pH 10.0, significantly enhanced ester production. In comparison to other esterification enzymes such as&#160;acyltransferase and lipase,&#160;CAR gave higher esterification yields in direct esterification under aqueous conditions. The scalability of CAR catalyzed esterification was demonstrated for the synthesis of cinoxate, an active ingredient in sunscreen, with an isolated yield of 32%. The CAR esterification reported here offers a new method for green esterification under high water content conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of Photoactive Polymers on Living Cell Surface via Bio&#8208;Palladium Catalysis for Modulating Biological Functions</title>
      <dc:description>Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. In this work, we develop a new bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy for in&#8208;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization reaction, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8208;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. Moreover, it can augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. By using this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be in&#8208;situ synthesized on the living cell surface, which paves a new way for modulating cell functions.</dc:description>

      <title>Docking of Cu(I) and Ag(I) in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Separation of Xenon</title>
      <dc:description>We present a metal docking strategy utilizing the precise spatial arrangement of organic struts as metal chelating sites in a MOF. Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8208;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units in MOF&#8208;303 [Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)] were used to chelate Cu(I) and Ag(I) with atomic precision and yield the metalated Cu&#8208; and Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 compounds [(CuCl)0.50&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2) and (AgNO3)0.49&#8208;Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)]. The coordination geometries of Cu(I) and Ag(I) were examined using 3D electron diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy techniques. The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus allowing for binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity. In particular, Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 exhibited Xe uptake of 59 cm3 cm&#8208;3 at 298 K and 0.2 bar with a selectivity of 10.4, placing it among the highest performing MOFs. It also gave up to 100% improvement of the dynamic separation performance in comparison to pristine MOF&#8208;303. This metalation strategy represents a new strategy for engineering MOFs to give high&#8208;performance gas separations.</dc:description>

      <title>Activating lattice oxygen at twisted surface in mesoporous CeO2 single crystal for efficient and durable catalytic CO oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Activating lattice oxygen linked to active sites at surface remains a fundamental challenge in many catalytic reactions. Here we create well&#8208;defined surface by directly growing porous CeO2 single crystals at 2 cm scale and confining Pt in lattice to construct isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at continuously&#8208;twisted surface in a monolith. We demonstrate significantly enhanced activation of lattice oxygen linked to Pt ions in contrast to Ce ions in local structures. We show complete CO oxidation with air at 67 &#176;C without degradation being observed after operation of 300 hours. The isolated Pt1/CeO2 sites at twisted surfaces not only contribute to the chemisorption of CO but also effectively activate the lattice oxygen linked to Pt ion for CO oxidation. The current work would open a new route to activate lattice oxygen by incorporating well&#8208;defined active structures confined at the surfaces.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A major challenge in photocatalysis consists in improving the efficiency, for example by harnessing a large portion of the solar spectrum.

Moreover, the optimum hydrogen (H2) production activity was about 52 and 64 times higher with respect to its pristine counterpart under the AM 1.5G and visible irradiation, respectively, being equivalent to the platinum&#8208;assisted PCN.

      <dc:description>Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites are attracting significant attention due to their chemical diversity and interesting optoelectronic properties. With a view to understanding both the optical and magnetic properties of these compounds, two series of Ru  IV  halides are presented here;  A  2  RuCl  6  and  A  2  RuBr  6  , where  A  is K, NH  4  , Rb or Cs.

Within a series, the energy of the ligand to metal charge&#8208;transfer increases as the unit cell expands with the larger  A  cation, and the band gaps are higher for the respective chlorides than for the bromides. The magnetic moments of the systems are temperature&#8208;dependent due to a non&#8208;magnetic ground state with  J  eff  = 0 caused by SOC.

      <title>Inhibition of urease, a Ni&#8208;enzyme: the reactivity of a key thiol with mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted catechols elucidated by kinetic, structural and theoretical studies</title>
      <dc:description>Urease is a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme able to catalyse the conversion of urea to ammonia and carbamate. Urea, the most used soil nitrogen fertiliser worldwide, is thus rapidly hydrolysed into species of nitrogen that can be taken up by plants, a function that, while essential, might also significantly decrease the efficiency of this process due to the release of gaseous species of nitrogen into the atmosphere, contributing to the green&#8208;house effect and to air pollution. Moreover, urease is also a virulence factor for ureolytic bacterial human pathogens that affect the health and livelihood of millions of people, especially, but not only, in developing nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. For these reasons, strategies for the efficient inhibition of urease activity by molecules that interact with the enzyme and counterbalance its negative effects must be pursued. Here, the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.</dc:description>

      <title>Charge&#8208;promoted self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins on an oxide surface</title>
      <dc:description>Metalation and self&#8208;metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self&#8208;metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;porphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinative binding of O2 at the active center of a copper&#8208;dependent enzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is abundant, it is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>C&#8211;H activation&#8208;based ring&#8208;forming methods constitute a powerful approach for the construction of complex molecular architectures, especially those containing a congested stereocenter.

The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity.

      <title>Oxidizing under Reductive Conditions: From Benzylic Ethers to Acetals with Perfect Atom&#8208;Economy by Titanocene(III)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>We describe a novel titanocene catalyzed method for the synthesis of acetals and hemiaminals from benzylic ethers and benzylic amines with pendant epoxides. The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single electron steps. The oxidative addition is constituted by an epoxide opening. A H&#8208;atom transfer to generate a benzylic radical serves as radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as reductive elimination. The reaction&#8208;mechanism was studied by high level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low&#8208;energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity can be deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures. Their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and by steric interactions between the titanocene&#8208;catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. A particularly interesting mechanistical aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes exert anti&#8208;breast cancer activity via inhibiting Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling</title>
      <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;coordinated organoiridium(III) complexes  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  , which contain C,N and S,S (dithione) chelating ligands, are found to inhibit breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis  via  targeting Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling for the first time. Treatment with  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  induce the degradation of LRP6, thereby decreasing the protein levels of DVL2, &#946;&#8208;catenin and activated &#946;&#8208;catenin, resulting in downregulation of Wnt target genes CD44 and survivin. Additionally,  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  can suppress cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, both complexes show the ability to inhibit sphere formation and mediate stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Importantly,  pbtIrSS  exerts potent anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis effects in mouse xenograft models through the blockage of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that  pbtIrSS  has great potential to be developed as a breast cancer therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism.</dc:description>

Treatment with  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  induce the degradation of LRP6, thereby decreasing the protein levels of DVL2, &#946;&#8208;catenin and activated &#946;&#8208;catenin, resulting in downregulation of Wnt target genes CD44 and survivin. Additionally,  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  can suppress cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, both complexes show the ability to inhibit sphere formation and mediate stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Importantly,  pbtIrSS  exerts potent anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis effects in mouse xenograft models through the blockage of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that  pbtIrSS  has great potential to be developed as a breast cancer therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Modular Synthesis of Organoboron Helically Chiral Compounds: Cutouts from Extended Helices</title>
      <dc:description>Two types of helically chiral compounds bearing one and two boron atoms were synthesized by a modular approach. Formation of the helical scaffolds was executed by the introduction of boron to flexible biaryl and triaryl derived from small achiral building blocks. All&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused azabora[7]helicenes feature exceptional configurational stability, blue or green fluorescence with quantum yields (&#934;fl) of 18&#8208;24% in solution, green or yellow solid&#8208;state emission (&#934;fl up to 23%) and strong chiroptical response with large dissymmetry factors of up to 1.12&#215;10&#8722;2. Azabora[9]helicenes consisting of angularly and linearly fused rings are blue emitters exhibiting &#934;fl of up to 47% in CH2Cl2 and 25% in the solid state. As revealed by the DFT calculations, their P&#8208;M interconversion pathway is more complex than of H1. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis shows clear differences in the packing arrangement of methyl and phenyl derivatives. These molecules are proposed as primary structures of extended helices.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Triplex and Quadruplex Assembled Nanosensors for Correlating K+ and pH in Lysosomes</title>
      <dc:description>It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K  +  and H  +  in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can respectively monitor K  +  and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K  +  and H  +  , respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200 mM K  +  and pH 5.0 to 8.2. Co&#8208;imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the efflux of K  +  was accompanied with the influx of H  +  , solving this long&#8208;standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Translation of Mycobacterium Survival Strategy to Develop a Lipo&#8208;peptide based Fusion Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>The entry of enveloped viruses requires the fusion of viral and host cell membranes.

Mycobacterium  survives inside the phagosome by inhibiting phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion with the help of a coat protein coronin 1. Structural analysis of coronin 1 and other WD40&#8208;repeat protein suggest that the trp&#8208;asp (WD) sequence is placed at distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif (more exposed) in coronin 1. The unique structural feature of coronin 1 was explored to identify a simple lipo&#8208;peptide sequence (myr&#8208;WD), which effectively inhibits membrane fusion by modulating the interfacial order, water penetration, and surface potential.

      <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell and  in situ  cell&#8208;based operation with nanopipette approach offers a possibility to elucidate the intracellular processes and may aid the improvement of therapy efficiency and precision. We present here a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette hybrid system that can achieve single&#8208;cell operation with high spatial/temporal resolution and negligible cell&#8208;damage. This strategy overcomes long&#8208;time obstacles in nanopipette single&#8208;cell studies as high electric potential (~1000 mV) or organic solvent is always used during operations, which would inevitably impose disturbance and damage to targeted cells. The light&#8208;triggered system promotes a potential&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive single&#8208;cell injection, resulting in a well&#8208;retained cell viability (90% survival rate). Moreover, the photo&#8208;driven injection enables a precisely dose&#8208;controllable single&#8208;cell drug delivery. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, significantly reduced lethal doses of doxorubicin (163&#8208;217 fg/cell) are demonstrated in corresponding cell lines, indicating a potential precision cell therapy strategy based on the photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette system.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>An efficient deracemization method for conversion of the racemate to the desirable (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer has been developed by coupling incompatible racemization and crystallization processes. By a library approach a derivative that crystallizes as a conglomerate in the solid phase has been identified. Racemization occurs via reversible hydrogenation over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) packed column at 130 &#176;C, whereas deracemization is achieved by alternating crystal growth/dissolution steps with temperature cycling between 5&#8208;15 &#176;C. These incompatible processes are combined by means of a flow system. Complete deracemization of the solid phase to the desired (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer (98% ee) takes place. Such an unprecedented deracemization by a decoupled crystallization/racemization approach can readily be turned into a practical process, and opens new opportunities for the development of essential enantiomerically pure building blocks that require harsh methods for racemization.</dc:description>

      <title>Breaking Platinum Nanoparticles to Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8208;C4 Co&#8208;catalysts for Enhanced Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
The single site of Pt&#8208;C4 in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Pt1&#8208;CN) is reported by a high&#8208;temperature calcination process. It features fast carrier migration with low resistance across the catalyst&#8211;solution interface. Benefiting from above merits and the tight contact between CuS semiconductor and Pt1&#8208;CN, the Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS gives a photocatalytic H2 generation rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an AQY of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530.







Abstract
Effective transfer and utilization of the photogenerated electrons are a key factor for achieving highly efficient H2 generation by photocatalytic water splitting. Apart from the activity of the co&#8208;catalyst, the interface between the co&#8208;catalyst and semiconductor is of particular importance. Guided by DFT calculations, single&#8208;atom (SA) Pt doped carbon nitride (CN) is successfully synthesized for use as the co&#8208;catalyst to the semiconducting CuS. The catalyst system (Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS) exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic performance for water splitting with a H2 production rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530. Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency is calculated to be 0.5&#8201;% under AM&#8197;1.5 illumination. This is the very first investigation of SA as the co&#8208;catalyst, which decreases the overpotential of CN during the water splitting and lowers interfacial resistance of the catalyst/co&#8208;catalyst and co&#8208;catalyst/electrolyte.

      <title>Racemic Monomer&#8208;Based One&#8208;Handed Helical Polymer Recognizes Enantiomers through Auto&#8208;Evolution of Its Helical Handedness Excess</title>
      <dc:description>The homochirality of bio(macro)molecules is a vital feature in living systems definitely responsible for their sophisticated functions. Obviously, any bio&#8208; and synthetic polymers composed of racemic monomers will show no chiral functions. Herein, we report that a racemic monomer&#8208;based optically&#8208;inactive polyacetylene folds into a one&#8208;handed helix assisted by a nonracemic alcohol, which can separate various enantiomers as a chiral stationary phase in chromatography. The chiral&#8208;resolving power is virtually identical to that of the enantiopure monomer&#8208;based one&#8208;handed helical polyacetylene. Because of its unique static memory of the induced helicity, the original racemic polyacetylene expresses an &#8220;auto&#8208;evolution&#8221; of its helical handedness over time, and at the same time, chirality of the nonracemic alcohol is discriminated accompanied by successive enhancement of its optical purity enantioselectively adsorbed on the helical polyacetylene due to the &#8220;chiral filter effect&#8221; as directly monitored by NMR, which contributes to further enhancing the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;excess of the helical polyacetylene.</dc:description>

      <title>Acceptor Engineering for Optimized ROS Generation Facilitates Reprogramming Macrophages to M1 Phenotype in Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted cancer immunotherapy.&#160;However, it still remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms relate to the corresponding macrophage polarization efficacy.&#160;In this contribution, we rationally design and synthesize three donor&#8208;acceptor structured photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;enhanced ROS generation. Their ROS&#8208;generating efficiencies can be adjusted by changing the acceptor, resulting in varied capabilities to activate macrophages. Surprisingly, we discover that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro&#8208;tumor type (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumor state (M1).&#160;  In vivo&#160;  experiments further prove that the AIEgen photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth in mice with a single PDT treatment, while the therapeutic outcome is significantly abolished in the mice with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the molecular designing guideline of macrophage&#8208;activatable photosensitizers and provides new insights into the working principle of macrophage activation in photodynamic immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Improving Overall Properties of Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials through Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>A major trade&#8208;off in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of pure organic materials is that the large luminescence dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) usually give rise to the suppression of luminescence efficiency (  &#934;  PL  ). Here, a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled system, driven by arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and octafluoronaphthalene (  OFN  ), was firstly reported to provide a solution to this problem. Two kinds of chiral PAHs based on pyrene and anthracene could co&#8208;assemble with  OFN  in hybrid solvents to form long&#8208;range ordered AP assemblies. The detailed process of AP interaction driving self&#8208;assembly was verified by the morphological measurement and fluorescence spectra. The AP assemblies exhibited chirality amplification not only in the excited state but also in the ground state. In addition, the AP assemblies showed enhanced luminescence efficiency compared with the individual chiral PAHs due to the energy barrier effect of  OFN  . The present strategy based on AP interaction could be applied to boost the development of highly efficient CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Persistent Radical Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and their Application in Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of persistent radical metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a significant challenge that underpins the expansion of their functionalities. Herein, via an  in situ  solvothermal method, a series of stable radical 2D MOFs have been assembled. The existence of (  m  &#8208;TTFTB)  3  (  m  &#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;tetrabenzoate) trimer building blocks is beneficial for the stability of radicals due to delocalization of the unpaired electron. The presence of hexanuclear rare earth (RE) cluster&#8208;based infinite one&#8208;dimensional chains further enhances the stability of the frameworks. The radical state of the middle TTF in the trimer has been observed by the change of central C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bond distances and the configuration of the TTF by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The radical characteristics are also confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Stability tests showed that these radials in the frameworks are stable even in non&#8208;aqueous/aqueous solutions and under acid/base environments (pH 1&#8208;12). Owing to the efficient light&#8208;absorption ability from intramolecular charge transfer, low thermal conductivity and outstanding stability, the radical 2D Dy&#8208;MOF shows excellent photothermal properties, an increase of 34.7 &#176;C within 240 seconds under one&#8208;sun illumination. The results demonstrate the stability of persistent radical MOFs by electron delocalization and their application in photothermal conversion, expanding their future applications in solar energy utilization, photothermal therapy, seawater desalination, photothermal catalysis and so on.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally Activated n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors Achieved by N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene Based Dopant</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular doping plays an important role in the modification of carrier density of organic semiconductors thus enhancing their optoelectronic performance. However, efficient n&#8208;doping remains challenging, especially due to the lack of strongly reducing and air&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Herein, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor, DMImC, is developed as a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with the excellent stability in air. Its thermolysis in situ regenerates free NHC and subsequently dopes typical organic semiconductors. In sequentially doped FBDPPV films, DMImC doesn&#8217;t disturb the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing of the polymer and achieves good miscibility with the polymer. As a result, a high electrical conductivity of up to 8.4 S cm&#8208;1 is obtained. Additionally, the thermally activated doping and the excellent air stability permit DMImC to be noninteractively co&#8208;processed with polymers in air. Our results reveal that DMImC can be served as an efficient n&#8208;dopant suitable for various organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupling of Cu(100) and (110) Facets Promotes Carbon Dioxide Conversion to Hydrocarbons and Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>Copper can efficiently electro&#8208;catalyze carbon dioxide reduction to C2+ products (e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH, and n&#8208;propanol). However, the correlation between the activity and active sites remains ambiguous, impeding further improvements in their performance. This paper describes the facet effect of copper crystal to promote CO adsorption and C&#8208;C coupling and consequently yield a superior selectivity for C2+ products. We achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87% and a large partial current density of 217 mA cm&#8208;2 toward C2+ products on Cu(OH)2&#8208;D at only &#8208;0.54 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow&#8208;cell electrolyzer. With further coupled to a Si solar cell, record&#8208;high solar conversion efficiencies of 4.47% and 6.4% are achieved for C2H4 and C2+ products, respectively. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the selective formation of C2+ products on Cu and paves the way for the practical application of electrocatalytic or solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>A Biomimetic DNA&#8208;Based Membrane Gate for Protein&#8208;Controlled Transport of Cytotoxic Drugs</title>
      <dc:description>
DNA nanotechnology can be used to rationally design a molecular gate to control the transport of small&#8208;molecule drugs across bilayer membranes. The DNA pore with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer lid opens in the presence of thrombin to increase the transport of the cytotoxic drug topotecan by 330&#8208;fold. The nanodevice could be adapted for a range of different protein triggers with applications in biosensing, research, and biomedicine.







Abstract
Chemistry is ideally placed to replicate biomolecular structures with tuneable building materials. Of particular interest are molecular nanopores, which transport cargo across membranes, as in DNA sequencing. Advanced nanopores control transport in response to triggers, but this cannot be easily replicated with biogenic proteins. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to build a synthetic molecular gate that opens in response to a specific protein. The gate self&#8208;assembles from six DNA strands to form a bilayer&#8208;spanning pore, and a lid strand comprising a protein&#8208;binding DNA aptamer to block the channel entrance. Addition of the trigger protein, thrombin, selectively opens the gate and enables a 330&#8208;fold increase inw the transport rate of small&#8208;molecule cargo. The molecular gate incorporates in delivery vesicles to controllably release enclosed cytotoxic drugs and kill eukaryotic cells. The generically designed gate may be applied in biomedicine, biosensing or for building synthetic cells.

      <title>Phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused Boroles: A Unique Coordination Mode and Weak B&#8211;N Coordination&#8208;Induced Dual Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Using 4&#8208;phenylpyridine or 2&#8208;phenylpyridine in place of biphenyl, two electron&#8208;poor phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused boroles,  [TipPBB1]  4  and  TipPBB2  were prepared.  [TipPBB1]  4  adopts a unique coordination mode and forms a tetramer with a cavity in both the solid state and solution. The boron center of  TipPBB2  is 4&#8208;coordinate in the solid state but the system dissociates in solution, leading to 3&#8208;coordinate borole species. Compared to its borafluorene analogues, the electron accepting ability of  TipPBB2  is largely enhanced by the pyridyl group.  TipPBB2  exhibits dual fluorescence in solution due to an equilibrium between free  TipPBB2  and a weak intermolecular coordination adduct with a second molecule. This equilibrium was further investigated by low temperature NMR and photophysical studies. Theoretical studies indicate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of  TipPBB2  localizes at the Tip group, in contrast to its borafluorene derivatives wherein the HOMOs are localized on borafluorene cores.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using 4&#8208;phenylpyridine or 2&#8208;phenylpyridine in place of biphenyl, two electron&#8208;poor phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused boroles,  [TipPBB1]  4  and  TipPBB2  were prepared.  [TipPBB1]  4  adopts a unique coordination mode and forms a tetramer with a cavity in both the solid state and solution. The boron center of  TipPBB2  is 4&#8208;coordinate in the solid state but the system dissociates in solution, leading to 3&#8208;coordinate borole species.

      <title>Efficient Catalysts for Green Synthesis of Adipic Acid from Biomass</title>
      <dc:description>Green synthesis of adipic acid from renewable biomass is a very attractive goal of sustainable chemistry. Herein, we report efficient catalysts for a two&#8208;step transformation of cellulose&#8208;derived glucose into adipic acid via glucaric acid. Carbon nanotube&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles are found to work efficiently for the oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. An activated carbon&#8208;supported bifunctional catalyst composed of rhenium oxide and palladium is discovered to be powerful for the removal of four hydroxyl groups in glucaric acid, affording adipic acid with a 99% yield. Rhenium oxide functions for the deoxygenation but is less efficient for four hydroxyl&#8208;group removal. The co&#8208;presence of palladium not only catalyzes the hydrogenation of olefin intermediates but also synergistically facilitates the deoxygenation. This work presents a green route for adipic acid synthesis, and offers a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis strategy for efficient deoxygenation.</dc:description>

      <title>2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyridinium: A Bulky, Highly Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituent Which Enhances Properties of Nickel(II) Ethylene Polymerization Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of Ni(II) and Pd(II) olefin polymerization catalysts can be enhanced by introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the supporting ligands rendering the metal centers more electrophilic. Reported here is a comparison of ethylene polymerization activity of a classical salicyliminato nickel catalyst substituted with the powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium (trippy) group to its&#8217; &#8211;CF  3  analog. The trippy substituent is substantially more electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#963;  meta  = 0.63) than the trifluoromethyl group (&#963;  meta  = 0.43) which results in a ca. 8&#8208;fold increase in catalytic turnover frequency. An additional advantage of trippy is its&#8217; high steric bulk relative to the trifluoromethyl group. This feature results in a four&#8208;fold increase in polymer molecular weight due to enhanced retardation of chain transfer. A significant increase in catalyst lifetime is observed as well.</dc:description>

      <title>Electron Transfer Process in Mixed Valence Compounds with Low&#8208;lying Energy Bridge in Different Oxidation States</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, the mixed valent compounds with the iso&#8208;cyanidometal&#8208;ligand bridge in different oxidation states are used as models for the investigation of ET process. Thus, we synthesized and fully characterized a series of trimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with [Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe]  n+  (n = 2 &#8208; 4), in which the one&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  3+  ) and two&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  4+  ) compounds possess an isocyanidometal&#8208;bridge whose energy is respectively lower and slightly higher than the terminal metal centers energies. For the  N  4  +  compounds, the bridge&#8208;state (Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  III  &#8208;Fe  II  ) and mixed valence states (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  II  or Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) could be simultaneous observed on the IR time&#8208;scale, supported by the ground state Potential Energy Surface (PES) that indicates as the number of methyl groups of Cp increases the ET excited mixed valence state becomes more and more stable. Whereas, for the  N  4  +  compounds, as the donor becomes stronger the ET excited bridge state (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) becomes more and more stable, and even becomes ground state due to the strong electronic coupling between Fe and Ru.

      <title>Multi&#8208;Layer &#960;&#8208;Stacked Molecules as Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>Multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacked emitters based on spatial confined donor/acceptor/donor (D/A/D) are developed for achieving high efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this case, dual donor moieties and single acceptor moiety are introduced to form two three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) emitters, DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which rely on spatial charge transfer (CT). Owing to the enforced face&#8208;to&#8208;face D/A/D pattern, effective CT interactions are realized, which lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 94.2% and 92.8% for two molecules. The resulting emitters exhibit the small singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  ) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. The maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0%/26.6% are realized for the devices based on DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which are higher than those of their D/A&#8208;type analogues.</dc:description>

In this case, dual donor moieties and single acceptor moiety are introduced to form two three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) emitters, DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which rely on spatial charge transfer (CT). Owing to the enforced face&#8208;to&#8208;face D/A/D pattern, effective CT interactions are realized, which lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 94.2% and 92.8% for two molecules. The resulting emitters exhibit the small singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  ) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. The maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0%/26.6% are realized for the devices based on DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which are higher than those of their D/A&#8208;type analogues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Control of Crystallinity and Stereocomplexation of Synthetic Carbohydrate Polymers from D&#8208; and L&#8208;Xylose</title>
      <dc:description>Manipulating the stereochemistry of polymers is a powerful method to alter their physical properties. Despite the chirality of monosaccharides, reports on the impact of stereochemistry in natural polysaccharides and synthetic carbohydrate polymers remain absent. Herein, we report the cocrystallization of regio&#8208; and stereoregular polyethers derived from D&#8208; and L&#8208;xylose, leading to enhanced thermal properties compared to the enantiopure polymers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stereocomplex between carbohydrate polymers of opposite chirality. In contrast, atactic polymers obtained from a racemic mixture of monomers are amorphous. We also show that the polymers hydroxyl groups are amenable to post&#8208;polymerization functionalization. These strategies afford a family of carbohydrate polyethers, the physical and chemical properties of which can both be controlled, and which opens new possibilities for polysaccharide mimics in biomedical applications or as advanced materials.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier&#8208;Hosting Potential Compensation&#8203;</title>
      <dc:description>Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from insufficient electrochemistry and low carrier&#8208;hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry with carrier&#8208;hosting potential compensation, high&#8208;energy Mg2+  /Na+  hybrid batteries are achieved. Typically, an unprecedented Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3(MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4  (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, realizing a reliable high&#8208;voltage operation. This operation enables more sufficient (de)intercalation of hybrid carriers (Mg2+/Na+  ), thereby enhancing the reversible capacity remarkably (233.4 mA h g&#8722;1  at 0.5 A g&#8722;1  , 92.7 Wh kg&#8722;1  electrode  , i.e. 1.75&#8208;fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes). Simultaneously, resorting to the relatively high Na+  &#8208;hosting potential in electrodes, the low Mg  2+  &#8208;hosting potential flaw is well&#8208;compensated. This synergistically widens/elevates the discharge plateau of the full battery up to 1.50 V. After 1350 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  , a low capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle is obtained, and the plateau is well retained. Mechanism study further reveals an unusual phase transformation of FVO to Fe2V3  and the low&#8208;lattice&#8208;strain pseudocapacitive (de)intercalation chemistry of MVCP. The proposed strategy would promote the exploration of other high&#8208;energy aqueous hybrid batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Almost 100% peroxymonosulfate conversion to singlet oxygen on single&#8208;atom CoN2+2 sites</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom CoN  4  active sites have demonstrated excellent efficiency in peroxymonosulfate activation. However, the identification of CoN  4  active sites and the detailed singlet oxygen generation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate activation still remain ambiguous. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species by atomically dispersed cobalt anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. As assisted by experimental and DFT calculations, CoN  2+2  was the definite active sites. Singlet oxygen was the absolutely predominant reactive oxygen species that the proportion was 98.89%. Different from the traditional CoN  4  configuration, the CoN  2+2  active sites transformed the pathway of peroxymonosulfate activation and facilitated the singlet oxygen generation. Spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed peroxymonosulfate on Co single atoms was prevented due to the energy barriers caused by weak positive Co atoms and CoN  2+2  coordination, determining PMS oxidation in non&#8208;radical pathway and simultaneous singlet oxygen generation. The generated singlet oxygen showed efficient activity for degradation of several organic pollutants in a broad pH range.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclic &#960;&#8208;Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters  1  and  2  , which possess two and four anthracene units, respectively, are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded  1  as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Cyclic &#960;&#8208;cluster  1  exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on  1  affords its photoisomer  1  &#8217; having C&#8211;C bonds that are longer than 1.65 &#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion to  1  under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of photoisomer  1  &#8217; (colorless) to  1  (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.</dc:description>
