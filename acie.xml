      <title>Evidence of phenolic pool as a key intermediate for zeolite&#8208;catalyzed lignin pyrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during&#160;catalytic conversion of biomass. However, no direct evidence has been reported on its full picture in molecular level, due to the huge challenges in probing the reactive and low volatile phenolic oligomers with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. Herein, we reported online detection and structural identification of phenolic pool by utilizing an in situ atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the phenolic pool is formed through monomers' repolymerization with an equidistant grouped pattern, and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke. The exploration of the real reactive species is also of great importance for the rational design and synthesis of advanced catalysts with high activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Flow Electrolyzer Mass Spectrometry with a Gas Diffusion Electrode Design</title>
      <dc:description>Operando mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to probe reaction intermediates near the surface of catalyst in electrochemical systems. For electrochemical reactions involving gas reactants, conventional operando mass spectrometry struggles in detecting reaction intermediates because the batch&#8208;type electrochemical reactor can only handle a very limited current density due to the low solubility of gas reactant(s). Herein, we developed a new technique, namely flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design, which enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities (&gt;100 mA cm&#8208;2). As a case study, we investigated the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) on polycrystalline copper and elucidated the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation. Combining FEMS and isotopic labelling, we showed that the oxygen in the as&#8208;formed acetaldehyde intermediate originates from the reactant CO, while ethanol and n&#8208;propanol contained mainly solvent oxygen. The observation highlights the complexity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed eCORR and provides direct experimental evidence into an isotopic scrambling mechanism, where acetaldehyde is going through oxygen exchange before further reduction to ethanol.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Single&#8208;Site Nanozyme for Tumor&#8208;Specific Amplified Cascade Enzymatic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity (nanozyme) are at the targeted frontier for therapeutic interventions. However, it still remains a formidable challenge to selectively kill tumor cells through enzymatic reactions, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Herein, a new strategy is presented by developing single&#8208;site cascade enzymatic reaction for tumor&#8208;specific therapy while avoiding off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. Copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu&#8208;HCF) nanozyme with active single&#8208;site copper exhibits cascade enzymatic activity (i.e., glutathione oxidase and peroxidase) within tumor microenvironment. Results show that Cu&#8208;HCF single&#8208;site nanozymes (SSNEs) first exert tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase ability through depleting intracellular glutathione and converting single&#8208;site CuII species to CuI for subsequent amplified peroxidase activity via Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8208;Weiss reaction, and thus substantial highly toxic hydroxyl radicals are generated for tumor cell apoptosis. Our work demonstrates that SSNEs could amplify the killing efficacy of singlet oxygen species and suppress the tumor growth in vivo, providing a promising self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;site nanozyme for amplified cascade enzymatic anticancer application.</dc:description>

      <title>How Oxygen&#8208;binding Enhances Long&#8208;range Electron Transfer: Lessons from Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
      <dc:description>Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing activation and O  2  reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET, is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. Interestingly, we find that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O  2  , directly leads to LPMO&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;O  2  &#8226;  , bypassing formation of the generally suggested LPMO&#8208;Cu(I) species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and has far&#8208;reaching implications in LPMO catalysis, as well as the O  2  or CO binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Sub&#8208;3 nm Ultrafine Cu2O for Visible Light&#8208;driven Nitrogen Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic N  2  fixation to NH  3  with water as the reducing agent represents a promising future strategy for ammonia synthesis, motivating the discovery of efficient photocatalysts that offer high sunlight utilization and catalytic efficiency to N  2  fixation. Cu  2  O, a low&#8208;cost, visible light&#8208;responsive semiconductor photocatalyst represents an ideal candidate for visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of N  2  to NH  3  from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, but remaining unexplored in this field yet. Noticeably, a majority of Cu  2  O photocatalysts synthesized to date with large lateral sizes (typically tens to hundreds of nanometers) generally suffer from severe electron&#8208;hole recombination and limited surface sites, restricting its photocatalytic activity for potential N  2  fixation. Ultrafine photocatalysts with lateral dimensions ~1&#8208;3 nm offer distinct advantages over conventional nanoparticle&#8208;based photocatalysts in this context, though the controlled synthesis of ultrafine photocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of uniformly sized and ultrafine Cu  2  O platelets with lateral size &lt; 3 nm  via  the  in&#8208;situ  topotactic reduction of a Cu(II)&#8208;containing layered double hydroxide with ascorbic acid. The supported ultrafine Cu  2  O offered excellent performance and stability for the visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of N  2  to NH  3  (the Cu  2  O&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized rate as high as 4.10 mmol gCu  2  O  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  at &#955; &gt; 400 nm), with the origin of the high activity being long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;excited electrons in trap states, an abundance of exposed active sites and the underlying support structure. This work guides the future design of ultrafine catalysts for NH  3  synthesis and other applications.</dc:description>

Noticeably, a majority of Cu  2  O photocatalysts synthesized to date with large lateral sizes (typically tens to hundreds of nanometers) generally suffer from severe electron&#8208;hole recombination and limited surface sites, restricting its photocatalytic activity for potential N  2  fixation. Ultrafine photocatalysts with lateral dimensions ~1&#8208;3 nm offer distinct advantages over conventional nanoparticle&#8208;based photocatalysts in this context, though the controlled synthesis of ultrafine photocatalysts remains challenging. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of uniformly sized and ultrafine Cu  2  O platelets with lateral size &amp;lt; 3 nm  via  the  in&#8208;situ  topotactic reduction of a Cu(II)&#8208;containing layered double hydroxide with ascorbic acid. The supported ultrafine Cu  2  O offered excellent performance and stability for the visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reduction of N  2  to NH  3  (the Cu  2  O&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized rate as high as 4.10 mmol gCu  2  O  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  at &#955; &amp;gt; 400 nm), with the origin of the high activity being long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;excited electrons in trap states, an abundance of exposed active sites and the underlying support structure. This work guides the future design of ultrafine catalysts for NH  3  synthesis and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tandem Mn&#8208;I exchange and homocoupling processes mediated by a synergistically operative lithium manganate</title>
      <dc:description>Pairing lithium and manganese(II) to form lithium manganate [Li  2  Mn(CH  2  SiMe  3  )  4  ] (  2b  ) enables the efficient direct Mn&#8208;I exchange of aryliodides, affording transient (aryl)lithium manganate intermediates which in turn undergo spontaneous C&#8208;C homocoupling at room temperature to furnish a range of symmetrical (bis)aryls in good yields under mild reaction conditions.

These studies have illuminated how Li and Mn work together in a synergistic manner to facilitate both the Mn&#8208;I exchange and the C&#8208;C bond forming steps. Both steps are carefully synchronised, with the alkyliodide ICH  2  SiMe  3  &#160;concomitantly generated during the Mn&#8208;I exchange, being essential to enable the aryl homocoupling process by acting as an  in&#8208;situ  generated oxidant.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic molecular crystals attracts great attention. The features of the persistent luminescence strongly depend on the electronic properties of the molecular components, mainly p&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores, and on their molecular packing in the crystal. Here, a new strategy is developed by rationally designing two isomeric molecular phosphors incorporating and combining for the first time a bridge for &#963;&#8208;conjugation between the D and A units and a structure&#8208;directing unit for H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Quantum chemical calculations highlight the critical role played by the two degrees of freedom of the s&#8208;conjugated bridge, on the chromophore optical properties. The molecular crystals exhibit RTP quantum yields up to 20% and lifetimes up to 520 ms. On the other hand, the crystal structures of the efficient phosphorescent materials establish the existence of an unprecedented well&#8208;organization of the emitters into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rectangular &#8216;columnar&#8208;like&#8217; supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding.

This approach enabled not only the first organocatalytic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones but also the first C3&#8208;nucleophilic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols.

      <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides are promising light emitters. However, it is still challenging to accurately design their structures with targeted photoluminescence properties. Here, high pressure is adopted to engineer the self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission of 0D (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium). Under initial compression, the simultaneous contraction and distortion of photoactive [Pb3Br11]5&#8208; vary the equilibrium of STE emissions between different excited states, tuning the emission color from yellow green to cyan. Notably, sufficient structural distortion under continuous compression leads to the formation of more and deeper STE states, exhibiting an unprecedented broadband white&#8208;light emission.

      <title>Spectroscopic and electrokinetic evidence for a bifunctional mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential anodic reaction in many energy storage processes. OER is most often proposed to occur via a mechanism involving four consecutive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps, which imposes a performance limit due to the scaling relationship of various oxygen intermediates. A bifunctional OER mechanism, in which the energetically demanding step of the attack of hydroxide on a metal oxo unit is facilitated by a hydrogen atom transfer to a second site, has the potential to circumvent the scaling relationship. However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8208;O bond forming step is the OH  &#8208;  attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a Ni  III  &#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive PCET steps. The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Acquiring High&#8208;Tc Layered Metal Halide Ferroelectrics via Cage&#8208;Confined Ethylamine Rotators</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest in the field of optoelectronics, due to the combination of excellent semiconducting and ferroelectric properties. Curie temperature (  T  c  ) below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on  T  c  tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)  2  (EA)Pb  2  Br  7  (  2L  ; IBA =  isob  utylammonium), and (IBA)  2  (EA)  2  Pb  3  Br  10  (  3L  ). Intriguingly,  T  c  is successfully tuned from 326 K (  2L  ) to 370 K (  3L  ) with increased layer&#8208;thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that  the improvement of  T  c  is due to the higher phase transition energy barrier triggered by cage&#8208;confined EAs rotators with increased layer&#8208;thickness.  This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;  T  c  2D OIHP ferroelectrics. In light of &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; strategy, one can expect more 2D OIHP ferroelectrics with promising performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic Recognition and Optical Sensing of Carboxylic Acids in Water by Using a Buried Salt Bridge and the Hydrophobic Effect</title>
      <dc:description>Buried salt bridges widely exist in protein structures, but are rarely used in synthetic systems for molecular recognition in water. By mimicking the binding pocket of bioreceptors, we designed and synthesized a pair of  endo  &#8208;functionalized macrocyclic hosts with secondary ammoniums in a hydrophobic cavity.

      <title>The Origin of Selective Adsorption of CO2 on Merlinoite Zeolites</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we describe the CO2  adsorption behavior at 25&#8208;75 &#176;C and 0&#8722;1.0 bar of various alkali cation&#8208;exchanged forms of merlinoite (framework type MER) zeolites with Si/Al = 2.3 and 3.8. The adsorption isotherms at 25 &#176;C on the Na+  , K+  , Rb+  , and Cs+  forms of MER zeolite with Si/Al = 2.3 are characterized by a clear step, the CO2  pressure of which differs notably according to the type of their extraframework cations. Structural analysis shows that CO2  adsorption on the former three zeolites includes the relocation of gating cations with high site occupancy and the remarkable concomitant structural breathing. We define this unusual adsorption phenomenon as a cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing mechanism. The overall results suggest that the actual mechanism of selective CO2  adsorption on intermediate&#8208;silica small&#8208;pore zeolites can change from cation gating to cooperative cation gating&#8208;breathing to breathing, depending on a combination of their topological and compositional (framework Al content and extraframework cation type and concentration) flexibilities.</dc:description>

The incorporation of disulfide bonds allows the triggered mechanical opening and release of siRNA in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH) in tumors to knockdown genes key to cancer progression.

      <title>Multi&#8208;mode Color&#8208;tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Single Component Coordination Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Materials with tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties have wide applications in security signs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encrypting and other fields, which have attracted great attention. However, the majority of reported tunable LPL materials are pure organic molecules or polymers. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers displaying color&#8208;tunable LPL were synthesized by the self&#8208;assembly of HTzPTpy ligand with different cadmium halides (X = Cl, Br, and I). In solid state, their LPL emission colors can be tuned by the time&#8208;evolution, as well as excitation and temperature variation, realizing multi&#8208;mode dynamic color tuning from green to yellow or green to red, and representing the first example in single component coordination polymer materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the modification of LPL is due to the balanced action from single molecule and aggregate triplet excited states aroused by external heavy&#8208;atom effect. The results suggest that the rational introduction of different halide anions into coordination polymers to realize multi&#8208;color LPL is promising for different domain applications, including imaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and security protection.</dc:description>

      <title>Carboxyboronate as a Versatile in situ CO surrogate in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>The application of carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate as an in situ CO surrogate for various palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations is described. Carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate was previously shown to be a bench&#8208;stable boron&#8208;containing building block for the synthesis of borylated heterocycles. The present study demonstrates that, in addition to its utility as a precursor to heterocycle synthesis, carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate is an excellent in situ CO surrogate that is tolerant of reactive functionalities such as amines, alcohols, and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. Its wide functional group compatibility is highlighted in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of aryl halides. A variety of amides, esters, (hetero)aromatic ynones, and bis(hetero)aryl ketones were synthesized in good to excellent yields in a one&#8208;pot fashion.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The application of carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate as an in situ CO surrogate for various palladium&#8208;catalyzed transformations is described. Carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate was previously shown to be a bench&#8208;stable boron&#8208;containing building block for the synthesis of borylated heterocycles. The present study demonstrates that, in addition to its utility as a precursor to heterocycle synthesis, carboxy&#8208;MIDA&#8208;boronate is an excellent in situ CO surrogate that is tolerant of reactive functionalities such as amines, alcohols, and carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. Its wide functional group compatibility is highlighted in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminocarbonylation, alkoxycarbonylation, carbonylative Sonogashira coupling, and carbonylative Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of aryl halides. A variety of amides, esters, (hetero)aromatic ynones, and bis(hetero)aryl ketones were synthesized in good to excellent yields in a one&#8208;pot fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxides activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged U(III)/U(IV) and U(III)/U(III) complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8208;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of U(III) and U(II), respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the U(III)/U(III) oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands. These results provide insight into the chemistry of low oxidation state metal oxides and demonstrate the use of oxo&#8208;bridged U(III)/U(III) complexes as a strategy to explore U(II) reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Diarylacetnitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State via a Radical Chain&#8208;transfer Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>Since the beginning of the history of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited due to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using diarylacetonitrile as a fluorescent molecular probe via this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.</dc:description>

Among them, double perovskites with Cs  2  AgInCl  6  composition, often doped with various elements, have been under the spotlight for their intriguing optical properties, viz., self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards crystals and nanocrystals, also aiming at exploring many alloy compositions with various monovalent and trivalent cations other than Ag  +  and In  3+  . Hence, we offer this perspective on the recent developments on Cs  2  AgInCl  6  bulk crystals and nanocrystals and take a close look at their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects. We also discuss progress on computational studies aiming at understanding the thermodynamic stability, the role of defects, and the origin of photoluminescence in relation to the STEs and the direct bandgap character.

      <dc:description>Studies on neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutic engineering have shown great potentials in treating infection and inflammation disorders. Conventional neutrophil labeling methods are time&#8208;consuming and often result in undesired contamination and activation since neutrophils are terminal&#8208;differentiated cells with a half&#8208;life span of only 7 h. A simple, fast and biocompatible strategy to construct engineered neutrophils is highly desirable but remains difficult to achieve. In this study, we present an AIEgen&#8208;lipid conjugate, which can efficiently label harvested neutrophils in 30&#8208;second with no washing step required. This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in vitro and in vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Dearomatizing [4+1] Spiroannulation of Naphthols: Discovery of Structurally Non&#8208;Traditional Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The development of streamlined synthetic routes to spirofluorene derivatives, in particular those with a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system, is an appealing task in the field of organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct [4+1] spiroannulation of ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts to construct spirofluorenyl naphthalenones (SFNP) under mild reaction conditions. This spiroannulation not only directly transforms the hydroxyl group into the carbonyl group, but also tolerates reactive functional groups such as the halo groups, which provide an opportunity to rapidly assemble structurally non&#8208;traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials that feature a carbonyl group with an adjacent spirofluorenyl unit as the acceptor. As an illustrated example, the OLED device utilizing the assembled  DMAC&#8208;SFNP  as the host material exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5 V and an ultra&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 32.2%. This work not only gives us an inspiration for designing structurally non&#8208;traditional TADF materials, but also displays the charm of C&#8722;H activation as a revolutionary synthetic strategy in the innovation of optoelectronic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Quantitative Imaging of Native Microbiota Distribution in the Gut</title>
      <dc:description>Due to the challenges to acquire detailed spatial information of gut bacteria in situ, microbiota&#8217;s three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distributions in the gut remain largely uncharted. Here, we propose a tissue clearing&#8208;based and D&#8208;amino acid labeling&#8208;facilitated (TiDaL) strategy that combines a novel microbiota in vivo labeling protocol, CUBIC&#8208;based tissue clearing and whole&#8208;mount tissue imaging, to achieve 3D imaging of indigenous gut microbiota. We demonstrate high resolution 3D acquisition of their biogeography in different gut sections, and present quantitative spatial details in relation to the host epithelium. We unexpectedly observe microbiota in the small intestine crypts which were thought to be bacteria&#8208;free. Moreover, significant bacterial overgrowth in the first two&#8208;thirds of the small intestine is detected in an enteritis model. We expect that this quantitative 3D imaging strategy for native gut microbiota will provide insightful information into the host&#8208;microbiota interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Cerium vanadate nanozyme with specific superoxide dismutase activity regulates mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis in neuronal cells</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal&#8208;containing enzymes (metallonanozymes) are of therapeutic importance to treat various diseases. However, it is still not clear whether such nanozymes can completely substitute the function of natural enzymes in living cells. In this work, we show for the first time that a cerium vanadate (CeVO  4  ) nanozyme can substitute the function of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) in the neuronal cells even when the natural enzyme is down&#8208;regulated by specific gene silencing. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1 and SOD2&#8208;depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. Further, the nanozyme effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative stress.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Low Cost Industrial Organic Pigment Coating</title>
      <dc:description>Surface passivation of perovskite thin films has been established as a promising approach to improving both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). While remarkable progress has been achieved with various surface passivating agents, long&#8208;term stability of PSCs has not been fully addressed. Here, we report a new strategy for surface passivation of PSCs using a low cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA). The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl)&#8208;quinacridone (TBOC&#8208;QA), followed by facile thermal annealing to convert TBOC&#8208;QA to insoluble QA. With the halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead Iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9% recorded for the unmodified devices. Density functional theory calculations revealed strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, which effectively reduced the surface defects of halide perovskite thin films and suppressed the nonradiative recombination. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to remarkably enhanced contact angle from 35.6&#8304; for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2&#8304; for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. As a result, the stabilities of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were greatly enhanced, retaining about 90 % of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000 hours storage under ambient conditions. The universality of this passivation strategy was evaluated by extending MAPbI3 systems to triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite systems, which further confirm the effectiveness of industrial pigment passivation of PSCs with enhanced efficiency and stability.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ assembly of choline acetyltransferase ligands by a hydrothiolation reaction reveals key determinants for inhibitor design</title>
      <dc:description>The potential drug target choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) catalyzes the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons, T&#8208;cells, and B&#8208;cells. Herein, we show that arylvinylpyridiniums (AVPs), the most widely studied class of ChAT inhibitors, act as substrate in an unusual coenzyme A&#8208;dependent hydrothiolation reaction. This&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;synthesis yields an adduct that is the actual enzyme inhibitor. The adduct is deeply buried in the active site tunnel of ChAT and interactions with a hydrophobic pocket near the choline binding site have major implications for the molecular recognition of inhibitors. Our findings clarify the inhibition mechanism of AVPs, establish a drug modality that exploits a target&#8208;catalysed reaction between exogenous and endogenous precursors, and provide new directions for the development of ChAT inhibitors with improved potency and bioactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Isomerization Reactions in Anionic Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Borates and Control of Properties and Reactivities in the resulting CoII Complexes through Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>We present here anionic borate based bi&#8208;mesoionic carbene compounds of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidene type (with additional cyclohexyl or phenyl substituents on borate) that undergo C&#8208;N isomerization reactions. The isomerized compounds are excellent ligands for Co  II  centers. Strong agostic interactions with the &#8222;C&#8208;H&#8220;&#8208;groups of the cyclohexyl substituents result in an unusual low spin square planar Co  II  complex, which is unreactive towards external substrates. Such agostic interactions are absent in the complex with phenyl substituents on the borate backbone. That complex displays a high spin tetrahedral Co  II  center, which is reactive towards external substrates including dioxygen. A combined synthetic, crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical approach is used to investigate the compounds. We conclusively show here that the structure and properties of these Co  II  complexes can be strongly influenced through interactions in the secondary coordination sphere. Additionally, we unravel a unique ligand rearrangement for these classes of anionic mesoionic carbene based ligands.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Prodrug and drug delivery systems are two effective strategies for improving the selectivity of chemotherapeutics. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged as promising carriers in targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, but have not yet been integrated with the prodrug strategy.

Their co&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were prepared as a smart carrier. Prodrug&#8208;loaded MIP specifically and sustainably accumulated at the tumor site and then gradually released. Unlike conventional prodrug designs, which often require in&#8208;liver bioconversion, our MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent. Thus, this study opened a new access to the development of smart prodrug delivery nanoplatforms.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with both coordination linkages and covalent linkages is prepared by coordinating Cu(I) with pyrazolate for an aldehyde&#8208;functionalized trinuclear complex, and subsequent imine condensation with p&#8208;phenylenediamine, a reaction typical for covalent organic framework (COF) synthesis.

In addition to the redox catalytic activity inherited from the complex, FDM&#8208;71 features effective photosensitizing activity.

      <title>Cooperative Carbon Dioxide Adsorption in Alcoholamine&#8208; and Alkoxyalkylamine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperative CO2 chemisorption is achieved in a metal&#8211;organic framework functionalized with structurally diverse alcoholamines and alkoxyalkylamines. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that CO2 adsorption occurs via the formation and propagation of hydrogen bond&#8208;stabilized carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate structures.







Abstract
A series of structurally diverse alcoholamine&#8208; and alkoxyalkylamine&#8208;functionalized variants of the metal&#8211;organic framework Mg2(dobpdc) are shown to adsorb CO2 selectively via cooperative chain&#8208;forming mechanisms. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectra and optimized structures obtained from van der Waals&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption profiles can be attributed to the formation of carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate chains that are stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions within the framework pores. These findings significantly expand the scope of chemical functionalities that can be utilized to design cooperative CO2 adsorbents, providing further means of optimizing these powerful materials for energy&#8208;efficient CO2 separations.

      <dc:description>
Biomimetic breathing micelles which can simultaneously inhale nitric oxide and exhale carbon monoxide are developed by T. You, J. Hu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010009). The breathing micelles show a combinatorial anti&#8208;inflammatory performance in the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, outperforming any single ingredient of the breathing micelles and commercially available NSAIDs such as dexamethasone.

      <title>The Triplet Hydroxyl Radical Complex of Phosphorus Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
A triplet radical&#8208;radical complex consisting of a hydroxyl radical and phosphorus monoxide (.OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP.), which serves as an important intermediate in the combustion of phosphines, has been captured in solid Ar&#8208;matrices at 2.8&#8197;K. Its interconversion with metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) has also been observed.







Abstract
Phosphorus monoxide (.PO) is a key intermediate in phosphorus chemistry, and its association with the hydroxyl radical (.OH) to yield metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) contributes to the chemiluminescence in the combustion of phosphines. When photolyzing cis&#8208;HOPO in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 2.8&#8197;K, the simplest dioxophosphorane HPO2 and an elusive hydroxyl radical complex (HRC) of .PO form. This prototypical radical&#8208;radical complex reforms into cis&#8208;HOPO at above 12.0&#8197;K by overcoming a barrier of 0.28&#177;0.02&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The vibrational spectra of this HRC and its D&#8208; and 18O&#8208;isotopologues suggest a structure of .OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP., for which a triplet spin multiplicity with a binding energy of &#8722;3.20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 has been computed at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level.

      <dc:description>
Intermolecular bond formations among Pt atoms in oligomers of PtII complexes are induced by photo&#8208;irradiation. Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved absorption measurements for aqueous solutions of K2[Pt(CN)4] recorded clear oscillations of transient absorption in the first few picoseconds with complex dynamics. The oscillations arise from the Pt&#8722;Pt stretch motions of the S1 trimer and S1 tetramer. The analysis of the oscillations provides clear assignments of the oligomers, as described by M.

      <title>Ion Selectivity of Water Molecules in Subnanoporous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Water&#8208;Treatment Membranes: A Structural Study of Hydrogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in a self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membrane obtained using soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy indicate that structural consistency among associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules contributes to ion selectivity. MgSO4 with high permeability (73&#8201;%) has hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of hydrating water closer than those of NaCl with low permeability (30&#8201;%) to those in the water&#8208;treatment membrane.







Abstract
We demonstrate hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membranes obtained using synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy. The ion selectivity of these water treatment membranes is usually understood by the size compatibility of nanochannels in the membrane with the Stokes radius of hydrated ions, or by electrostatic interaction between charges inside the nanochannels and such ions. However, based on a comparison between the hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water molecules in the nanochannels of the water treatment membrane and those surrounding the ions, we propose a definite contribution of structural consistency among the associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules to the ion selectivity. Our observation delivers a novel concept to the design of water treatment membranes where water molecules in the nanochannel can be regarded as a part of the material that controls the ion selectivity.

      <title>Advancing the logic of chemical synthesis: C&#8211;H activation as strategic and tactical disconnections for C&#8211;C bond construction</title>
      <dc:description>The design of synthetic routes via retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. In this context, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8211;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners . Despite its interest and proven efficacy however, its uptake in the total synthesis has been tepid, partially owing to their apparent synthetic intractability and inapplicability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for their implementation. These issues are addressed in this review, where we guide the identification of retrosynthetic opportunities to incorporate C&#8211;H activation processes for the generation of C&#8211;C bonds. By comparing and analyzing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches against recent C&#8211;H activation methods, this review demonstrates how the successful implementation of C&#8211;H activation&#8208;enabled C&#8211;C bond construction has led to the realization of more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, we identify shortcomings due to limitations in existing C&#8211;H activation processes, and project how some of the total syntheses highlighted in this review can be further economized by adopting emerging next&#8208;generation C&#8211;H activation technologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Bifunctional Effects of Cation Additive on Na&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aprotic Na&#8210;O  2  batteries have attracted growing interest due to their low overpotentials and high energy density. Their cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency are limited, however, by Na dendrite formation and superoxide (O  2  &#8208;  ) degradation. Here, we present a bifunctional cation additive, tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA  +  ), to simultaneously protect the Na anode and stabilize the superoxide. The adsorption of TBA  +  on the Na anode suppresses the dendrite formation in the Na plating and ensures stable anode cycling at high current density in both Ar and oxygen atmospheres. In addition, the aprotic Na&#8210;O  2  batteries with TBA  +  show increased Coulombic efficiency as well as good rate capability. These are rewarded by the fast desolvation kinetics of O  2  &#8208;  and suppression of the disproportionation reaction of O  2  &#8208;  with TBA  +  , as confirmed by  Ab initio  molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory calculations. This bifunctional effect of this cation additive paves a new avenue for development of Na&#8210;O  2  batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Color&#8208; and Dimension&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Harvesting Organic Charge&#8208;Transfer Alloys for Controllable Photon&#8208;Transport Photonics</title>
      <dc:description>An electron donor/acceptor pair comprising perylene (Pe) and 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene (DCA) was specifically designed to construct organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) alloys via weak CT interaction through a solution co&#8208;assembly route.

      <title>Precise Fixation of an NO molecule inside Carbon Nanopores: A Long&#8208;Range Electron&#8208;Nuclear Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>A [60]fullerene&#8208;based carbon nanopore was synthesized to realize the placing of two molecules of nitric oxide (NO) at an accurate distance. A linear orientation of the two NO molecules inside the assembled nanopores was confirmed crystallographically.

      <title>Utilization of Lanthipeptide Synthetases is a General Strategy for the Biosynthesis of 2&#8208;Aminovinyl&#8208;Cysteine Motifs in Thioamitides</title>
      <dc:description>Thioamitide natural products are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translational modified peptides (RiPPs) with potent antiproliferative and pro&#8208;apoptotic activities. Their biosynthesis remains largely unknown, especially for the characteristic C&#8208;terminal 2&#8208;aminovinyl&#8208;cysteine (AviCys) motifs. Herein, we report the discovery that homologs of class III lanthipeptide synthetases (LanKC  t  s) encoded outside putative thioamitide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) fully dehydrate the precursor peptides. Remarkably, LanKCt enzymes bind tightly to cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside thioamitide BGCs, and the resulting enzyme complex complete the macrocyclization of AviCys rings. Furthermore, our studies reveal that LanKC  t  enzymes are present in the genomes of many thioamitide&#8208;producing strains and participate in the generation of AviCys macrocycles, therefore serving as a general biosynthetic strategy. Together, our study reveals an unprecedented system that lanthipeptide synthetases outside thioamitide BGCs participate in their biosynthesis by specific association with cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside BGCs, and thus paves the way for the bioengineering of this class of bioactive natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>The bonding and transformation of a ligand&#8208;protected gold nanohydride cluster</title>
      <dc:description>Gold is the most inert metal and does not react with H  2  to form bulk hydrides. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a gold nanohydride protected by diphosphine ligands, [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  [dppo = 1,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)octane]. The Au  22  core consists of two Au  11  units bonded by eight Au atoms not coordinated by the diphosphine ligands. The four H atoms are found to bridge the eight uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface. Each Au  11  unit can be viewed as a tetravalent superatom forming four delocalized Au&#8208;H&#8208;Au bonds, similar to the quadruple bond first discovered in the [Re  2  Cl  8  ]  2&#8211;  inorganic cluster. The [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  nanohydride is found to lose H atoms over an extended time via H combination (H  2  ), proton (H  +  ) and hydride (H  &#8211;  ) transfers.

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Iron Oxide in Molten Salts to Fe/Fe3C Modified Carbon for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for water electrolysis and electrochemical conversion of CO  2  . Integrating electrochemical fixation of CO  2  and electrochemical metallurgy to prepare advanced OER electrocatalyst is a promising solution to promote carbon neutrality and renewable energy. Herein, the electrochemical reduction of CO  2  and Fe  2  O  3  are combined in molten salts to prepare cathodic Fe  3  C&#8208;based electrocatalyst and anodic oxygen at 600 &#176;C with enhanced current efficiency. The resulting Fe  3  C&#8208;based electrocatalyst outperforms precious electrocatalyst towards the OER operation in 1 M KOH due to a dynamic structural evolution to form an interface of Fe  3  C&#8208;FeOOH.</dc:description>

      <title>Dinuclear Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates Composed of Tetradentate Ligands with Al(III) Chromophores: Optical Resolution and Multi&#8208;color Circularly Polarized Luminescence Properties</title>
      <dc:description>New chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, composed of tetradentate ligands with aluminum (III) ions, are described. These are synthesized in two steps using inexpensive pyrrole derivatives, hydrazine, and aluminum chloride. These molecular architectures (ALPHY) show multi&#8208;color (cyan, yellow, and orange) photoluminescence in solution and in the solid&#8208;states which depends on the substituents of the ligands. The photoluminescence quantum yields of helicates were up to 54%. The right&#8208;handed (  P  ) and left&#8208;handed (  M  ) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization in some solvents and are mirror images according to circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an absolute luminescence dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) of up to the 10  &#8211;3  order. Mixing the different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL characters. This study offers a glimpse into the potential applications of chromophores with diverse photophysical properties.</dc:description>
