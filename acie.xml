      <title>Assembly of Complex 1,4&#8208;Cycloheptadienes by (4+3) Cycloaddition of Rhodium(II) and Gold(I) Non&#8208;Acceptor Carbenes</title>
      <dc:description>The formal (4+3) cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;dienes with Rh(II) and Au(I) non&#8208;acceptor vinyl carbenes, generated from vinylcycloheptatrienes or alkoxyenynes, respectively, leads to 1,4&#8208;cycloheptadienes featuring complex and diverse substitution patterns, including natural dyctiopterene C&#8217; and a hydroxylated derivative of carota&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene. A complete mechanistic picture is presented, in which Au(I) and Rh(II) non&#8208;acceptor vinyl carbenes were shown to undergo a&#160; vinylcyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement or a direct (4+3) cycloaddition &#160;that takes place in a non&#8208;concerted manner.</dc:description>

      <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical Benzylic C&#8211;H Amination</title>
      <dc:description>C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling represents an ideal strategy to synthesize various amines but remains challenging due to the requirement for sacrificial chemical oxidants and the difficulty in controlling the regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective electrochemical amination reaction that can convert benzylic C&#8211;H bonds to C&#8211;N linkages via H  2  evolution without need for external oxidants or metal catalysts. The synthetic strategy involves anodic cleavage of benzylic C&#8211;H to form a carbocation intermediate, which is then trapped with an amine nucleophile leading to C&#8211;N bond formation. Key to the success is to include HFIP as a cosolvent to modulate the oxidation potentials of the alkylbenzene substrate and the aminated product to avoid overoxidation of the latter.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbenaporphyrines: No Longer Missing Ligands in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Chemistry</title>

Here, a novel polyphenol&#8208;based nanocomplex is thus designed to evoke highly efficacious cancer immunosurveillance while localizing therapy on primary tumor and to minimize systemic side effects.

The combination of gossypol from cotton plant and photosensitizer Ce6 can induce chemotherapeutic/photodynamic immunogenic cancer cell death upon laser irradiation, which is supported by rich maturation of dendritic cells, concentrated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and significant inhibition of distant untreated tumors. Finally, an assistance of the programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy can enhance the anti&#8208;tumor immune stimulation of our nanoplatform to a higher level.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based smart prodrug delivery system for specific targeting, prolonged retention and tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered release</title>
      <dc:description>Prodrug and drug delivery systems are two effective strategies for improving the selectivity of chemotherapeutics. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged as promising carriers in targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, but have not yet been integrated with the prodrug strategy. Herein we report an MIP&#8208;based smart prodrug delivery system for specific targeting, prolonged retention and tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered release. 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluorocytidine (DFCR) and sialic acid (SA) were used as a prodrug and a marker for tumor targeting, respectively. Their co&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were prepared as a smart carrier. Prodrug&#8208;loaded MIP specifically and sustainably accumulated at the tumor site and then gradually released. Unlike conventional prodrug designs, which often require in&#8208;liver bioconversion, our MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent. Thus, this study opened a new access to the development of smart prodrug delivery nanoplatforms.</dc:description>

      <title>An Imine&#8208;Linked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Reactive Oxygen Species Generator</title>
      <dc:description>A new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with both coordination linkages and covalent linkages is prepared by coordinating Cu(I) with pyrazolate for an aldehyde&#8208;functionalized trinuclear complex, and subsequent imine condensation with p&#8208;phenylenediamine, a reaction typical for covalent organic framework (COF) synthesis. This MOF&#215;COF collaboration yields FDM&#8208;71 with honeycomb layers stacked in eclipsed fashion. After dissociating the Cu(I)&#8211;pyrazolate coordination in FDM&#8208;71, the obtained organic components carry the information of structural defects, and thus vacancy identity (aldehyde&#8208;based unit vacancy and amine&#8208;based unit vacancy) and concentration are definitely resolved. In addition to the redox catalytic activity inherited from the complex, FDM&#8208;71 features effective photosensitizing activity. The two functions integrated in one well&#8208;defined structure is demonstrated by its high efficiency in decomposing H&#8322;O&#8322; and consequent excitation of O&#8322; to reactive oxygen species.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperative Carbon Dioxide Adsorption in Alcoholamine&#8208; and Alkoxyalkylamine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperative CO2 chemisorption is achieved in a metal&#8211;organic framework functionalized with structurally diverse alcoholamines and alkoxyalkylamines. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that CO2 adsorption occurs via the formation and propagation of hydrogen bond&#8208;stabilized carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate structures.







Abstract
A series of structurally diverse alcoholamine&#8208; and alkoxyalkylamine&#8208;functionalized variants of the metal&#8211;organic framework Mg2(dobpdc) are shown to adsorb CO2 selectively via cooperative chain&#8208;forming mechanisms. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectra and optimized structures obtained from van der Waals&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations indicate that the adsorption profiles can be attributed to the formation of carbamic acid or ammonium carbamate chains that are stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions within the framework pores. These findings significantly expand the scope of chemical functionalities that can be utilized to design cooperative CO2 adsorbents, providing further means of optimizing these powerful materials for energy&#8208;efficient CO2 separations.

      <title>In Situ Exploration of the Structural Transition during Morphology&#8208; and Efficiency&#8208;Conserving Halide Exchange on a Single Perovskite Nanocrystal</title>
      <dc:description>Controlled fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures with unique physicochemical properties is vital for future technologies. In this study, transformation from red&#8208;emitting metal halide perovskite CH  3  NH  3  PbI  3  nanocrystals (NCs) to green&#8208;emitting CH  3  NH  3  PbBr  3  NCs was achieved without significant morphological changes and loss of photoluminescence (PL) efficiency via a controlled halide exchange reaction. In situ single&#8208;particle PL imaging along with detailed structural and elemental characterizations revealed that sudden cooperative transitions between two light&#8208;emitting states via intermediate dark states with &gt;100 s durations during halide exchange originate from two distinct defect&#8208;mediated reconstruction processes with different activation energies (0.072 and 0.40 eV), leading to an isokinetic temperature of ~314 K, across a solid&#8208;state miscibility gap between the I&#8208; and Br&#8208;rich phases inside a single NC.</dc:description>

In this study, transformation from red&#8208;emitting metal halide perovskite CH  3  NH  3  PbI  3  nanocrystals (NCs) to green&#8208;emitting CH  3  NH  3  PbBr  3  NCs was achieved without significant morphological changes and loss of photoluminescence (PL) efficiency via a controlled halide exchange reaction. In situ single&#8208;particle PL imaging along with detailed structural and elemental characterizations revealed that sudden cooperative transitions between two light&#8208;emitting states via intermediate dark states with &amp;gt;100 s durations during halide exchange originate from two distinct defect&#8208;mediated reconstruction processes with different activation energies (0.072 and 0.40 eV), leading to an isokinetic temperature of ~314 K, across a solid&#8208;state miscibility gap between the I&#8208; and Br&#8208;rich phases inside a single NC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Triplet Hydroxyl Radical Complex of Phosphorus Monoxide</title>
      <dc:description>
A triplet radical&#8208;radical complex consisting of a hydroxyl radical and phosphorus monoxide (.OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP.), which serves as an important intermediate in the combustion of phosphines, has been captured in solid Ar&#8208;matrices at 2.8&#8197;K. Its interconversion with metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) has also been observed.







Abstract
Phosphorus monoxide (.PO) is a key intermediate in phosphorus chemistry, and its association with the hydroxyl radical (.OH) to yield metaphosphorous acid (cis&#8208;HOPO) contributes to the chemiluminescence in the combustion of phosphines. When photolyzing cis&#8208;HOPO in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 2.8&#8197;K, the simplest dioxophosphorane HPO2 and an elusive hydroxyl radical complex (HRC) of .PO form. This prototypical radical&#8208;radical complex reforms into cis&#8208;HOPO at above 12.0&#8197;K by overcoming a barrier of 0.28&#177;0.02&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The vibrational spectra of this HRC and its D&#8208; and 18O&#8208;isotopologues suggest a structure of .OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OP., for which a triplet spin multiplicity with a binding energy of &#8722;3.20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 has been computed at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level.

      <title>Ion Selectivity of Water Molecules in Subnanoporous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Water&#8208;Treatment Membranes: A Structural Study of Hydrogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in a self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membrane obtained using soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy indicate that structural consistency among associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules contributes to ion selectivity. MgSO4 with high permeability (73&#8201;%) has hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of hydrating water closer than those of NaCl with low permeability (30&#8201;%) to those in the water&#8208;treatment membrane.







Abstract
We demonstrate hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membranes obtained using synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy. The ion selectivity of these water treatment membranes is usually understood by the size compatibility of nanochannels in the membrane with the Stokes radius of hydrated ions, or by electrostatic interaction between charges inside the nanochannels and such ions. However, based on a comparison between the hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water molecules in the nanochannels of the water treatment membrane and those surrounding the ions, we propose a definite contribution of structural consistency among the associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules to the ion selectivity. Our observation delivers a novel concept to the design of water treatment membranes where water molecules in the nanochannel can be regarded as a part of the material that controls the ion selectivity.

     alt="Ion Selectivity of Water Molecules in Subnanoporous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Water&#8208;Treatment Membranes: A Structural Study of Hydrogen Bonding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in a self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membrane obtained using soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy indicate that structural consistency among associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules contributes to ion selectivity. MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with high permeability (73&#8201;%) has hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of hydrating water closer than those of NaCl with low permeability (30&#8201;%) to those in the water&#8208;treatment membrane.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membranes obtained using synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy. The ion selectivity of these water treatment membranes is usually understood by the size compatibility of nanochannels in the membrane with the Stokes radius of hydrated ions, or by electrostatic interaction between charges inside the nanochannels and such ions. However, based on a comparison between the hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water molecules in the nanochannels of the water treatment membrane and those surrounding the ions, we propose a definite contribution of structural consistency among the associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules to the ion selectivity. Our observation delivers a novel concept to the design of water treatment membranes where water molecules in the nanochannel can be regarded as a part of the material that controls the ion selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advancing the logic of chemical synthesis: C&#8211;H activation as strategic and tactical disconnections for C&#8211;C bond construction</title>
      <dc:description>The design of synthetic routes via retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. In this context, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8211;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners . Despite its interest and proven efficacy however, its uptake in the total synthesis has been tepid, partially owing to their apparent synthetic intractability and inapplicability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for their implementation. These issues are addressed in this review, where we guide the identification of retrosynthetic opportunities to incorporate C&#8211;H activation processes for the generation of C&#8211;C bonds. By comparing and analyzing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches against recent C&#8211;H activation methods, this review demonstrates how the successful implementation of C&#8211;H activation&#8208;enabled C&#8211;C bond construction has led to the realization of more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, we identify shortcomings due to limitations in existing C&#8211;H activation processes, and project how some of the total syntheses highlighted in this review can be further economized by adopting emerging next&#8208;generation C&#8211;H activation technologies.</dc:description>

      <title>Bifunctional Effects of Cation Additive on Na&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aprotic Na&#8210;O  2  batteries have attracted growing interest due to their low overpotentials and high energy density. Their cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency are limited, however, by Na dendrite formation and superoxide (O  2  &#8208;  ) degradation. Here, we present a bifunctional cation additive, tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA  +  ), to simultaneously protect the Na anode and stabilize the superoxide. The adsorption of TBA  +  on the Na anode suppresses the dendrite formation in the Na plating and ensures stable anode cycling at high current density in both Ar and oxygen atmospheres. In addition, the aprotic Na&#8210;O  2  batteries with TBA  +  show increased Coulombic efficiency as well as good rate capability. These are rewarded by the fast desolvation kinetics of O  2  &#8208;  and suppression of the disproportionation reaction of O  2  &#8208;  with TBA  +  , as confirmed by  Ab initio  molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory calculations. This bifunctional effect of this cation additive paves a new avenue for development of Na&#8210;O  2  batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Utilization of Lanthipeptide Synthetases is a General Strategy for the Biosynthesis of 2&#8208;Aminovinyl&#8208;Cysteine Motifs in Thioamitides</title>
      <dc:description>Thioamitide natural products are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translational modified peptides (RiPPs) with potent antiproliferative and pro&#8208;apoptotic activities. Their biosynthesis remains largely unknown, especially for the characteristic C&#8208;terminal 2&#8208;aminovinyl&#8208;cysteine (AviCys) motifs.

Remarkably, LanKCt enzymes bind tightly to cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside thioamitide BGCs, and the resulting enzyme complex complete the macrocyclization of AviCys rings. Furthermore, our studies reveal that LanKC  t  enzymes are present in the genomes of many thioamitide&#8208;producing strains and participate in the generation of AviCys macrocycles, therefore serving as a general biosynthetic strategy. Together, our study reveals an unprecedented system that lanthipeptide synthetases outside thioamitide BGCs participate in their biosynthesis by specific association with cysteine decarboxylases encoded inside BGCs, and thus paves the way for the bioengineering of this class of bioactive natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>The bonding and transformation of a ligand&#8208;protected gold nanohydride cluster</title>
      <dc:description>Gold is the most inert metal and does not react with H  2  to form bulk hydrides. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a gold nanohydride protected by diphosphine ligands, [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  [dppo = 1,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)octane]. The Au  22  core consists of two Au  11  units bonded by eight Au atoms not coordinated by the diphosphine ligands. The four H atoms are found to bridge the eight uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gold is the most inert metal and does not react with H  2  to form bulk hydrides. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a gold nanohydride protected by diphosphine ligands, [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  [dppo = 1,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)octane]. The Au  22  core consists of two Au  11  units bonded by eight Au atoms not coordinated by the diphosphine ligands. The four H atoms are found to bridge the eight uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface. Each Au  11  unit can be viewed as a tetravalent superatom forming four delocalized Au&#8208;H&#8208;Au bonds, similar to the quadruple bond first discovered in the [Re  2  Cl  8  ]  2&#8211;  inorganic cluster. The [Au  22  H  4  (dppo)  6  ]  2+  nanohydride is found to lose H atoms over an extended time via H combination (H  2  ), proton (H  +  ) and hydride (H  &#8211;  ) transfers.

      <title>Elucidation of the Chemical Role of the Pyroclastic Materials on the State of Conservation of Mural Paintings from Pompeii</title>

      <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes show a pronounced tendency to form higher&#8208;order structures, such as &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers and aggregates with aromatic binding partners. Reliable methods for determining the structure of these non&#8208;covalent adducts are scarce. Here, we demonstrate that artificial square&#8208;planar Cu(pyridine)  4  complexes, covalently incorporated into tetramolecular G&#8208;quadruplexes, can be used as rigid spin labels for detecting dimeric structures by measuring intermolecular Cu  2+  &#8208;Cu  2+  distances  via  pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy. A series of G&#8208;quadruplex dimers of different spatial dimensions, formed in tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail or head&#8208;to&#8208;head stacking mode, were unambiguously distinguished. Measured distances are in full agreement with results of molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, intercalation of two well&#8208;known G&#8208;quadruplex binders, PIPER and telomestatin, into G&#8208;quadruplex dimers resulting in sandwich complexes was investigated with the new method, and previously unknown binding modes were discovered.

      <dc:description>Nimorazole belongs to the imidazole&#8208;based family of antibiotics to fight against anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, nimorazole is now in Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe for potential use as a hypoxia radiosensitizer for treatment of head and neck cancers. We envision the use of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole as a theragnostic hypoxia contrast agent that can be potentially deployed in the next&#8208;generation MRI&#8208;LINAC systems. Here, we report the first but very important steps to create long&#8208;lasting (for tens of minutes) hyperpolarized state on three  15  N sites of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole with T  1  of up to ~6 minutes. The nuclear spin polarization was boosted by ~67000&#8208;fold at 1.4 T (corresponding to  P  15N  of 3.2%) via  15  N&#8208;  15  N spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization technique relying on simultaneous exchange of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole and parahydrogen on polarization transfer Ir&#8208;IMes catalyst. The isomeric side product of [  15  N  3  ]nimorazole synthesis was hyperpolarized too.

      <title>Emission&#8208;Tunable Amorphous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymers Based on Thermoreversible Dynamic Covalent Bond</title>
      <dc:description>Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are useful for photoelectric, biochemical devices and bioimaging sensors. In the last few years, dynamic covalent chemistry has aroused substantial attention as it offers a way to create intelligent materials with feedback and response functions. Through Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between dienes and dienophiles, three polymers&#160;are synthesized and can be reversibly transformed by thermally reversible dynamic covalent bonds. All polymers show decent RTP emission with different colors. For poly&#8208;Br&#8208;An solid, the absolute phosphorescence quantum yield reaches up to 12%. This study provides a new method to rationally design and synthesize emission&#8208;tunable organic RTP materials via dynamic covalent bonds.</dc:description>

In the last few years, dynamic covalent chemistry has aroused substantial attention as it offers a way to create intelligent materials with feedback and response functions. Through Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between dienes and dienophiles, three polymers&#160;are synthesized and can be reversibly transformed by thermally reversible dynamic covalent bonds. All polymers show decent RTP emission with different colors. For poly&#8208;Br&#8208;An solid, the absolute phosphorescence quantum yield reaches up to 12%. This study provides a new method to rationally design and synthesize emission&#8208;tunable organic RTP materials via dynamic covalent bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Discovery of Key TIPS&#8208;Naphthalene for Efficient Visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV Photon Upconversion under Sunlight and Room Light</title>
      <dc:description>While many studies have been done on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;based photon upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) to produce visible light with high efficiency, the efficient TTA&#8208;UC from visible to UV light, despite its importance for a variety of solar and indoor applications, remains a challenging task. Here, we report the highest visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV TTA&#8208;UC efficiency of 20.5% based on the discovery of an excellent UV emitter, 1,4&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)naphthalene (TIPS&#8208;Nph). TIPS&#8208;Nph is an acceptor with desirable features of high fluorescence quantum yield and high singlet generation efficiency by TTA. In addition, TIPS&#8208;Nph has a low enough triplet energy level to be sensitized by Ir(C6)2(acac), a superior donor that does not quench UV emission. The combination of TIPS&#8208;Nph and Ir(C6)2  (acac) realizes the efficient UV light production even with weak light sources such as an AM 1.5 solar simulator and room LEDs.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting material (HTM) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce, and their molecular design principles are still unclear.

Upon incorporating rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, the resulting molecular HTMs  TQ3  and  TQ4  show completely different molecular arrangement as well as charge transporting capabilities. Comparing with  TQ3  , the coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline based  TQ4  endows enriched intermolecular interactions and stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, thus achieving a higher hole mobility of 2.08 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  . It also shows matched energy levels and high thermal stability for application in PSCs.

      <title>Optimized active layer morphologies via ternary copolymerization of polymer donors for 17.6% efficiency organic solar cells with enhanced fill factor</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays, the commercially available polymer donor PM6 has been applied widely in organic solar cells (OSCs) and achieved the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversation efficiencies (PCEs). To fully explore its photovoltaic potential in OSCs, fine regulating the molecular structure to further optimize the related active layer morphologies is of considerable significance. Herein, we demonstrated a simple random ternary copolymerization approach to develop a terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 by carefully incorporating the third 5,5'&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz, 20 mol%) unit into the molecular backbone of PM6 (PM6&#8208;Tz00). It is found that this method can properly tailor the molecular ordering, orientation, and aggregation properties without obviously affecting absorption and energy levels of polymer donors, and then effectively optimize the active layer morphology with a small molecule acceptor Y6, as well as the electrical properties of the related devices, ultimately improving fill factor (FF) and thus boosting PCE. As a result, the PM6&#8208;Tz20&#8208;based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 17.1% with a significantly enhanced FF of 0.77, which is much higher than that of the controlled OSCs based on PM6 (PCE=15.7% and FF=0.72). Notable, using Ag (220 nm) instead of Al (100 nm) as cathode, the champion PCE was further improved to 17.6% due to the increase of photocurrent. These are among the best results for the binary OSCs reported to date. Our work provides a simple but effective approach to optimize blend morphologies of OSCs for higher photovoltaic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br): New Halides with Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response Induced by Acetate Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are the key component in solid state laser. New SHG effective halides, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br), have been rationally synthesized by introducing acetate groups into lead halide perovskites under moderate solvothermal conditions. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br) feature highly oriented anionic chains constructed by distorted [PbX4O2] (X = I, Br) polyhedrons. Both the theoretical studies and the dipole moment calculations uncover that their SHG effects are mainly originated from the distorted [PbX4O2] (X = I, Br) polyhedrons. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2I5 exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second harmonic generation (SHG) response (8&#215;KDP) and large birefringence (0.26@ 1064 nm). Moreover, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2X5 (X = I, Br) also possess high laser damage threshold (LDT) which are almost 27 and 41 times that of AgGaS2, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineered Coatings via the Assembly of Amino&#8208;Quinone Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Engineering coatings with precise physicochemical properties allows for control over the interface of a material and its interactions with the surrounding environment. However, assembling coatings with well&#8208;defined properties on different material classes remains a challenge. Herein, we report a co&#8208;assembly strategy to precisely control the structure and properties (e.g., thickness, adhesion, wettability, and surface potential) of coatings on various materials (27 substrates examined) using quinone and polyamine building blocks. By increasing the length of the amine building blocks from small molecule diamines to branched amine polymers, we can tune the properties of the films, including the thickness (from ~5 to ~50 nm), interfacial adhesion (0.05 to 5.54 nN), water contact angle (130 to 40&#176;), and surface potential (&#8722;42 to 28 mV). The films can be post&#8208;functionalized through the in situ formation of diverse nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanocrystals. Our approach provides a platform for the rational design of engineered, substrate&#8208;independent coatings for various applications.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In contrast to the wealth of asymmetric transformations for generating central chirality from alkyl radicals, the enantiocontrol over the allenyl radicals for forging axial chirality represents an uncharted domain. The challenge arises from the unique elongated linear configuration of the allenyl radicals that necessitates the stereo&#8208;differentiation of remote motifs away from the radical reaction site. We herein describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric radical 1,4&#8208;carboalkynylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes via the coupling of allenyl radicals with terminal alkynes, providing diverse synthetically challenging tetrasubstituted chiral allenes. A chiral N,N,P&#8208;ligand is crucial for both the reaction initiation and the enantiocontrol over the highly reactive allenyl radicals. The reaction features a broad substrate scope, covering a variety of (hetero)aryl and alkyl alkynes and 1,3&#8208;enynes as well as radical precursors with excellent functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

      <title>CoNi Alloy Nanoparticles Embedded in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Carbon for the Highly Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton via a Charge&#8208;Transfer Effect</title>
      <dc:description>Separation of xenon and krypton is one of the greatest challenges in the gas industries due to their close molecular structure and similar properties. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation using chemically stable carbon adsorbents is a promising technology. Herein, we propose a new strategy for Xe/Kr separation using MOF&#8208;derived metallic carbon adsorbents. M&#8208;Gallate (M = Ni, Co) were used as precursors to fabricate CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded carbon adsorbents by one&#8208;step auto&#8208;reduction pyrolysis. The optimal NiCo@C&#8208;700 exhibits record&#8208;high IAST selectivity (24.1) and Henry&#8217;s selectivity (20.1) of Xe/Kr among reported carbon adsorbents. The density functional theory calculations, local density of states calculation, charge density difference and Bader charge analysis reveal the great affinity with Xe benefits from the presence of Ni or CoNi nanoparticles as a result of more charge transfer from Xe than Kr to metal, thus providing higher binding energy. Breakthrough experiments further verify NiCo@C&#8208;700 a promising candidate for Xe/Kr separation.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of (Hetero&#8208;)aromatic Nitriles from C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds</title>
      <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free activation of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to value&#8208;added products is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Herein, we report the use of the commercially available organic dye 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPP) for the conversion of methylarenes to the corresponding aryl nitriles via a photocatalytic process. Applying this methodology, a variety of cyanobenzenes have been synthesized in good to excellent yield under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free conditions. We demonstrate the scope of the method with over 50 examples including late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules (celecoxib) and complex structures such as L&#8208;menthol, amino acids and cholesterol derivatives. Further, the presented synthetic protocol is applicable for gram&#8208;scale reactions. In addition to methylarenes, selected examples for the cyanation of aldehydes, alcohols and oximes are demonstrated as well. Detailed mechanistic investigations have been carried out using time&#8208;resolved luminescence quenching studies, control experiments and NMR spectroscopy as well as kinetic studies, all supporting the proposed catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>The Size&#8208;Accelerated Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>The factors responsible for the kinetic resolution of alcohols by chiral pyridine derivatives have been elucidated by measurements of relative rates for a set of substrates with systematically growing aromatic side chains using accurate competitive linear regression analysis. Increasing the side chain size from phenyl to pyrenyl results in a rate acceleration of more than 40 for the major enantiomer. Based on this observation a new catalyst with increased steric bulk has been designed that gives enantioselectivity values of up to  s  = 250. Extensive conformational analysis of the relevant transition states indicates that alcohol attack to the more crowded side of the acyl&#8208;catalyst intermediate is favoured due to stabilizing CH&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Experimental and theoretical results imply that enantioselectivity enhancements result from accelerating the transformation of the major enantiomer through attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) rather than retarding the transformation of the minor isomer through repulsive steric forces.</dc:description>

      <title>Exploring the Organometallic Route to Molecular Spin Qubits: the [CpTi(cot)] case</title>
      <dc:description>The coherence time of the 17&#8208;electron, mixed sandwich complex  [CpTi(cot)], (&#951;  8  &#8208;cyclooctatetraene)(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)&#8208; titanium, was found to reach 34 ms at 4.5 K in a frozen deuterated toluene solution. This result represents a remarkable coherence time for a highly protonated molecule. We here confirm that the intramolecular distances between the Ti and H atoms provide a good compromise between instantaneous and spin diffusion sources of decoherence. In addition,  ab initio  calculations at the molecular and crystal packing levels reveal that the characteristic low&#8208;energy ring rotations of the sandwich framework do not yield a detrimental spin&#8208;lattice relaxation because of their small spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Much shorter and almost temperature&#8208;independent phase memory times  T  m  were observed when [CpTi(cot)] was diluted in the diamagnetic (16&#8208;electron) crystalline host [CpTi(cht)], (&#951;  7  &#8208;cycloheptatrienyl)(&#951;  5  &#8208;cyclopentadienyl)titanium. Such finding reinforces the deactivating role of both intermolecular interactions involving the hydrogen atoms of neighboring molecules and cluster formation in the host crystal lattice. The volatility of [CpTi(cot)] and the accessibility of the semi&#8208;occupied, non&#8208;bonding d  z  2  orbital make this neutral compound an ideal candidate for single&#8208;qubit addressing on surface and quantum sensing in combination with scanning probe microscopies.</dc:description>

      <title>An amphiphilic sulfonatocalix[5]arene as a novel activator for membrane transport of lysine&#8208;rich peptides and proteins</title>
      <dc:description>Lysine (K) is an important target residue for protein and peptide delivery across membranes. K is the most frequently exposed residue in proteins, leading to high demand for the development of K&#8208;specific transport activators. However, designing activators for K&#8208;rich peptides and proteins is more challenging than for arginine&#8208;rich species because of the kosmotropic nature of K and its recognition difficulty. In this study, we designed a new amphiphilic sulfonatocalix[5]arene (sCx5&#8208;6C) as a K&#8208;specific transport activator. sCx5&#8208;6C was tailored with two key elements, recognition of K and the ability to embed into membranes. We measured the membrane transport efficiencies of &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;  l  &#8208;lysine, heptalysine, and histones across artificial membranes and of &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;  l  &#8208;lysine into live cells, activated by sCx5&#8208;6C. The results demonstrate that sCx5&#8208;6C acts as an efficient activator for translocating K&#8208;rich peptides and proteins, which cannot be achieved by known arginine&#8208;specific activators.</dc:description>

      <title>The &#8216;Hidden&#8217; Reductive [2 + 2 + 1]&#8208;Cycloaddition Chemistry of 2&#8208;Phosphaethynolate Revealed by Reduction of a Th&#8208;OCP Linkage</title>
      <dc:description>The reduction chemistry of the newly emerging 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate (OCP)&#8722; is not well explored, and there remains many unanswered questions about this ligand in this context. Here, we report that reduction of [Th(TrenTIPS)(OCP)] (2, TrenTIPS = [N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)]3&#8722;) with RbC8 produces via [2 + 2 + 1] cycloaddition an unprecedented hexathorium complex [{Th(TrenTIPS)}6(m&#8208;OC2P3)2(m&#8208;OC2P3H)2Rb4] (5) featuring four five&#8208;membered [C2P3] phosphorus&#8208;heterocycles, which can be converted to a rare oxo [{Th(TrenTIPS)(&#956;&#8208;ORb)}2] (6) and the known cyclometallated complex [Th{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2(CH2CH2SiPri2CHMeCH2)}] (4) by thermolysis, providing an unprecedented example of reductive cycloaddition reactivity in the chemistry of 2&#8208;phosphaethynolate. This has permitted us to isolate intermediates which might normally remain unseen leading to the erroneous assumption of a concerted fragmentation process for (OCP)&#8208; and not cycloaddition products that then decompose with [Th(TrenTIPS)O]&#8722; essentially acting as a protecting&#8208; then leaving&#8208;group. In contrast, when KC8 or CsC8 are used, the phosphinidiide C&#8208;H bond activation product [{Th(TrenTIPS)}Th{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2[CH2CH2SiPri2CH(Me)CH2C(O)m&#8208;P]}] (3) and the oxo complex [{Th(TrenTIPS)(&#956;&#8208;OCs)}2] (7) were isolated.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The chemoselective cleavage of a six&#8208;membered aromatic ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminium(I) complex. This type of selectivity is unprecedented. In every example of transition metal mediated C&#8211;C sigma&#8208;bond activation reported to date, the reaction occurs at the central four&#8208;membered ring of biphenylene. Insight into the origin of chemoselecitivty was obtained through a detailed mechanistic analysis (isolation of an intermediate, DFT studies, activation strain analysis).

      <dc:description>It is commonly considered that Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) fibrils are heavily involved in the neurological diseases. Establishing an external model based on the core recognition motif (diphenylalanine, FF) of A&#946; would be of significance in understanding the assembly and disassembly of A&#946; fibrils in living system.

It is found that the different stacking modes (H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregates) of additives and the microenvironment of chiral carbon play vital roles for the selectively chiral transfer or amplification of L&#8208;FmocFF.

      <dc:description>It is extremely challenged to grow single crystal halide perovskite films (SCHPFs) with not only desired transport properties but also large lateral size with much thinner thickness. Here, we report the growth of freestanding single crystal CsPbBr  3  SCHPFs with thickness less than 100 nm and a lateral size close to centimeter for the first time. A new model for growth kinetics (&#936;= Aexp[&#8208;(E  A  &#8208;E  s  )/(k  B  T)]) is proposed to address the surface energy and temperature effect on the growth rate of ultrathin CsPbBr  3  single&#8208;crystal film. The experimental results and DFT calculations both demonstrated that the surfactant plays a critical role in modifying the surface energy and achieving anisotropic growth. This work opens new opportunities for high&#8208;quality SCHPFs with large lateral size and controllable thickness that may find wide applications for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Water&#8208;Stable DMASnBr3 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite for Effective Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Water&#8208;stable metal halide perovskites could foster tremendous progresses in several research fields where their superior optical properties can make differences. In this work we report clear evidence of water stability in a lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite, namely DMASnBr3, obtained by means of diffraction, optical and x&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Such unprecedented water&#8208;stability has been applied to promote photocatalysis in aqueous medium, in particular by devising a novel composite material by coupling DMASnBr3 to g&#8208;C3N4, taking advantage from the combination of their optimal photophysical properties. The prepared composites provide an impressive hydrogen evolution rate &gt;1700 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 generated by the synergistic activity of the two composite costituents. DFT calculations provide insight into this enhancement deriving it from the favorable alignment of interfacial energy levels of DMASnBr3 and g&#8208;C3N4. The demonstration of an efficient photocatalytic activity for a composite based on lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite in water paves the way to a new class of light&#8208;driven catalysts working in aqueous environments.</dc:description>
