         <title>Installing a Green Engine to Drive an Enzyme Cascade: a Light&#8208;Powered in vitro Biosystem for Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many existing in vitro  biosystems harness power from the chemical energy embedded in substrates, co&#8208;substrates, and light or electric energy provided from abiotic parts, causing the issue of compromising the atom economy, incompatibility between biological and abiotic parts, and most importantly, incapability to spatiotemporally co&#8208;regenerate ATP and NADPH. Herein, we develop a light&#8208;powered in vitro  biosystem for poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) synthesis using natural thylakoid membranes (TMs) to co&#8208;regenerate ATP and NADPH for a five&#8208;enzyme cascade. Through effective coupling of cofactor regeneration and mass conversion, 20 mM PHB from 50 mM sodium acetate was yielded with a molar conversion efficiency of carbon of 80.0 % and the light energy conversion efficiency of 3.04 %, much higher than efficiencies of similar in vitro  PHB synthesis biosystems. This suggests the promise of installing TMs as a green engine to drive more enzyme cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals: A Critical Overview of Experimental Elastic Tensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review presents a critical and comprehensive overview of current experimental measurements of complete elastic constant tensors for molecular crystals. For a large fraction of these molecular crystals detailed comparisons are made with elastic tensors obtained using the corrected small basis set Hartree&#8208;Fock method S&#8208;HF&#8208;3c, and these are shown to be competitive with many of those obtained from more sophisticated density functional theory plus dispersion (DFTD) approaches. These detailed comparisons between S&#8208;HF3c, experimental and DFT&#8208;D computed tensors make use of a novel rotation&#8208;invariant spherical harmonic description of the Young&#8217;s modulus, and identify outliers among sets of independent experimental results. The result is a curated database of experimental elastic tensors for molecular crystals, which we hope will stimulate more extensive use of elastic tensor information &#8208; experimental and computational &#8208; in studies aimed at correlating mechanical properties of molecular crystals with their underlying crystal structure. This is particularly relevant in current studies that exploit techniques such as nanoindentation and micro&#8208;focused mapping experiments on bent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrene Photochemistry of Manganese N&#8208;Haloamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese complexes supported by macrocyclic tetrapyrrole ligands represent an important platform for nitrene transfer catalysis and have been applied to both C&#8211;H amination and olefin aziridination catalysis. The reactivity of the transient high&#8208;valent Mn nitrenoids that mediate these processes renders characterization of these species challenging. Here we report the synthesis and nitrene transfer photochemistry of a family of Mn(III)  N  &#8208;haloamide complexes. The  S  = 2  N  &#8208;haloamide complexes are characterized by  1  H NMR, UV&#8208;vis, IR, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopies, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photolysis of these complexes results in the formal transfer of a nitrene equivalent to both C&#8211;H bonds, such as the a&#8208;C&#8211;H bonds of tetrahydrofuran, and olefinic substrates, such as styrene, to afford aminated and aziridinated products, respectively. Low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy and analysis of kinetic isotope effects for C&#8211;H amination indicate halogen&#8208;dependent photoreactivity: Photolysis of  N  &#8208;chloroamides proceeds via initial cleavage of the Mn&#8211;N bond to generate Mn(II) and amidyl radical intermediates; in contrast, photolysis of  N  &#8208;iodoamides proceeds via N&#8211;I cleavage to generate a Mn(IV) nitrenoid (  i.e.  , {MnNR}  7  species). These results establish  N  &#8208;haloamide ligands as viable precursors in the photosynthesis of metal nitrenes and highlight the power of ligand design to provide access to reactive intermediates in group&#8208;transfer catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Heterogeneous Scandium Lewis Acid Catalysts for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While continuous&#8208;flow reactions with chiral heterogeneous catalysts provide a highly efficient method to synthesize optically active compounds, chiral heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis has been less extensively explored. We have developed the first example of chiral heterogeneous Sc catalysts, which demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions of isatins with indoles. Noncovalent interactions between chiral Sc complexes and heteropoly acid&#8208;anchored amine&#8208;functionalized SiO  2  as support were utilized for the synthesis. The heteropoly acid was found to be crucial for the preparation, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. The chiral ligand could be easily tuned without chemical modification and the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of a biologically active compound was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>General Tolerance of Galactosyltransferases toward UDP&#8208;galactosamine Expands Their Synthetic Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accessing large numbers of structurally diverse glycans and derivatives is essential to functional glycomics. We showed a general tolerance of galactosyltransferases toward uridine&#8208;diphosphate&#8208;galactosamine (UDP&#8208;GalN), which is not a commonly used sugar nucleotide donor. The property was harnessed to develop a two&#8208;step chemoenzymatic strategy for facile synthesis of novel and divergent N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)&#8208;glycosides and derivatives in preparative scales. The discovery and the application of the new property of existing glycosyltransferases expand their catalytic capabilities in generating novel carbohydrate linkages, thus prompting the synthesis of diverse glycans and glycoconjugates for biological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered Reversible Disassembly of an Engineered Protein Nanocage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel protein nanocage has been developed capable of on&#8208;demand reversible disassembly via simple buffer exchanges under mild conditions. Data presented herein also show the nanocage is capable of in vivo and in vitro cargo loading, suggesting a broad range of possible applications in biocatalysis, bionanotechnology, and biomedicine. Additional findings include structure determination and protein design verification via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy.







Abstract
Protein nanocages play crucial roles in sub&#8208;cellular compartmentalization and spatial control in all domains of life and have been used as biomolecular tools for applications in biocatalysis, drug delivery, and bionanotechnology. The ability to control their assembly state under physiological conditions would further expand their practical utility. To gain such control, we introduced a peptide capable of triggering conformational change at a key structural position in the largest known encapsulin nanocompartment. We report the structure of the resulting engineered nanocage and demonstrate its ability to disassemble and reassemble on demand under physiological conditions. We demonstrate its capacity for in vivo encapsulation of proteins of choice while also demonstrating in vitro cargo loading capabilities. Our results represent a functionally robust addition to the nanocage toolbox and a novel approach for controlling protein nanocage disassembly and reassembly under mild conditions.

         <title>A Coral&#8208;Like FeP@NC Anode with Increasing Cycle Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Particle Refinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Refinement of FeP nanoparticles can result in a gradually increase in the graphitization degree and interface magnetization. Furthermore, it provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity during cycling.







Abstract
We present a coral&#8208;like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D carbon framework (FeP@NC). Due to the highly continuous N&#8208;doped carbon framework and a spring&#8208;buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, a sodium&#8208;ion battery with the FeP@NC composite exhibits an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 82.0&#8201;% in 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles. Also, particle refinement leads to a capacity increase during cycling. The FeP nanoparticles go through a refining&#8211;recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which results in a gradually increase in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more active sites for Na+ storage and contributes to a rising capacity with cycling. The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Luminescent Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks for Multicolor Particle Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy is established using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and dye molecules. Tunable and customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) is achieved on inorganic, organic, and biological particles, with potential applications in the physical and life sciences.







Abstract
The development of fluorescence labeling techniques has attracted widespread interest in various fields, including biomedical science as it can facilitate high&#8208;resolution imaging and the spatiotemporal understanding of various biological processes. We report a supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy using luminescent metal&#8208;phenolic networks (MPNs) constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and common and commercially available dyes. The rapid labeling process (&lt;5&#8197;min) produces ultrathin coatings (&#8776;10&#8197;nm) on diverse particles (e.g., organic, inorganic, and biological entities) with customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) simply through the selection of fluorophores. The fluorescent coatings are stable at pH values from 1 to 8 and in complex biological media owing to the dominant &#960; interactions between the dyes and MPNs. These coatings exhibit negligible cytotoxicity and their strong fluorescence is retained even when internalized into intracellular compartments. This strategy is expected to provide a versatile approach for fluorescence labeling with potential in diverse fields across the physical and life sciences.

         <title>Ambimodal Transition States in Diels&#8211;Alder Cycloadditions of Tropolone and Tropolonate with N&#8208;Methylmaleimide**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cycloaddition of tropolone with maleimide in the presence of weak base involves an ambimodal transition state that leads directly to both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts.







Abstract
The Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of tropolone and its conjugate base with N&#8208;methylmaleimide have been explored computationally and experimentally. Previous studies of the [4+2] cycloaddition under basic conditions show that both endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained in similar, but variable amounts. Density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) explorations of potential energy surfaces, and molecular dynamics trajectories show that the reaction involves an ambimodal transition state for the reaction of the ammonium tropolonate with N&#8208;methylmaleimide, and that similar amounts of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;products are obtained. The thermal reaction, studied experimentally in detail here for the first time, is predicted to form the endo&#8208;adduct through an ambimodal transition state. The exo&#8208;adduct can be formed from the same transition state, but requires a hydrogen shift, that hinders this reaction dynamically. Longer reaction times give a small excess of the exo&#8208;product, which is thermodynamically more stable.

         <title>Organophosphine&#8208;Sandwiched Copper Iodide Cluster Enables Charge Trapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction based on biligand&#8208;sandwiched copper iodide nanocluster is constructed as charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories featuring large memory windows and energy&#8208;saving operation. Spatial electronic anisotropy of the lamellar structure and steric and insulating effects of phosphine ligands effectively hinder intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping as a basis of real single&#8208;molecule devices.







Abstract
Herein, we report a feasible molecular design of the binuclear clusters featuring the n&#8208;p&#8208;n heterojunction of biligand&#8208;sandwiched inorganic units, which can be used as the effective charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories with the large memory windows and the energy&#8208;saving operation. We found that the hole confinement on the p&#8208;type inorganic units is enhanced by spatial electronic anisotropy provided by the peripheral n&#8208;type organic phosphine ligands. The steric hindrance of the coordination sites, the insulating effect of the carbon&#8208;phosphorous single bonds and the parallel dual&#8208;ligand coordination mode jointly elongate the interunit distances to nanometer scale and restrain the intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping. Our results show that the spatial effect is crucial to further amplifying the electronic differences between organic and inorganic units for function enhancement.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a feasible molecular design of the binuclear clusters featuring the n-p-n heterojunction of biligand-sandwiched inorganic units, which can be used as the effective charge trapper in ambipolar transistor memories with the large memory windows and the energy-saving operation. We found that the hole confinement on the p-type inorganic units is enhanced by spatial electronic anisotropy provided by the peripheral n-type organic phosphine ligands. The steric hindrance of the coordination sites, the insulating effect of the carbon-phosphorous single bonds and the parallel dual-ligand coordination mode jointly elongate the interunit distances to nanometer scale and restrain the intramolecular electronic communications, leading to the tunable and reliable charge trapping. Our results show that the spatial effect is crucial to further amplifying the electronic differences between organic and inorganic units for function enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Lipid Droplet Dynamics through a Buffer Strategy with a Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Sensitive Fluorogenic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a probe, LD&#8208;FG, for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by using structure illumination microscopy. LD&#8208;FG allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic response. The replacement of photobleached LD&#8208;FG with fresh probe molecules from outside the LDs ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized.







Abstract
Although super&#8208;resolution imaging offers an opportunity to visualize cellular structures and organelles at the nanoscale level, cellular heterogeneity and unpredictability still pose a significant challenge in the dynamic imaging of live cells. It is thus vital to develop better&#8208;performing and more photostable probes for long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging. Herein, we report a probe, LD&#8208;FG, for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). LD&#8208;FG allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic response. The replacement of photobleached LD&#8208;FG by intact probe molecules outside the LDs ensures the long&#8208;time stability of the fluorescence imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized. Using this probe, two LD coalescence modes were discovered. The dynamic imaging also allowed us to propose a new model of LD maturation during adipocyte differentiation, i.e., a fast LD coalescence followed by a slow ripening step. The excellent performance of LD&#8208;FG makes the buffer strategy an effective method for designing fluorescent probes for cell dynamic imaging.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Thick Wafer&#8208;Size NiO Films with Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy allows wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films to be grown with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale (0.92&#8197;nm) for the first time. The sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior







Abstract
Adding ferromagnetism into semiconductors attracts much attentions due to its potential usage of magnetic spins in novel devices, such as spin field&#8208;effect transistors. However, it remains challenging to stabilize their ferromagnetism above room temperature. Here we introduce an atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy to grow wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale (0.92&#8197;nm) for the first time. Surface lattice defects break the magnetic symmetry of NiO and produce surface ferromagnetic behaviors. Our sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 157&#8197;emu/cc and coercivity of 418&#8197;Oe. Attributed to wafer size, the easily&#8208;transferred NiO thin film is further verified in a magnetoresistance device. Our work provides a sub&#8208;nanometric platform to produce wafer&#8208;size ferromagnetic NiO thin films as atomic layer magnetic units in future transparent magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>A Phase Inversion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Fabrication of Helical Microfibers towards Versatile Artificial Abdominal Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) technology is developed to continuously produce stretchable high&#8208;strength polycaprolactone (PCL) helical microfibers with controllable structures. The helical microfibers are weaved into strong, bi&#8208;oriented stretchable, flexible and biocompatible artificial skins meshes, which can be used to prevent abdominal incisional hernia formation and promote wound healing.







Abstract
Microfluidic spinning technology (MST), incorporating microfluidics with chemical reactions, has gained considerable interest for constructing anisotropic advanced microfibers, especially helical microfibers. However, these efforts suffer from the limited material choices, restricting their applications. Here, a new phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) method is proposed for producing helical microfibers. This method undergoes a physicochemical phase inversion process, which is capable of efficiently manufacturing strong (tensile stress of more than 25&#8197;MPa), stretchable, flexible and biocompatible helical microfibers. The helical microfibers can be used to fabricate bi&#8208;oriented stretchable artificial abdominal skin, preventing incisional hernia formation and promoting the wound healing without conglutination. This research not only offers a universal approach to design helical microfibers but also provides a new insight into artificial skin.

         <title>Tuning and Directing Energy Transfer in the Whole Visible Spectrum through Linker Installation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable energy transfer with designable direction, from second linkers to pristine MOFs or from pristine MOFs to second linkers, was achieved in the whole visible spectrum via installing color&#8208;full emissive second linkers into the full&#8208;color emissive pristine MOFs.







Abstract
While limited choice of emissive organic linkers with systematic emission tunability presents a great challenge to investigate energy transfer (ET) over the whole visible light range with designable directions, luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) may serve as an ideal platform for such study due to their tunable structure and composition. Herein, five Zr6 cluster&#8208;based LMOFs, HIAM&#8208;400X (X=0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM&#8208;400X as a pristine scaffold for linker installation. Six full&#8208;color emissive 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based dicarboxylic acids (L) were successfully installed into HIAM&#8208;400X matrix to form HIAM&#8208;400X&#8208;L, in which the ET can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two&#8208;dimensional space in tuning the emission via ET in LMOFs.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced, Self&#8208;Traced Nanomotors on the Surface of Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;based motors moving on the silicon surface are demonstrated. Their movement leaves a trace engraved on the silicon surface, representing an exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. Their velocity can be greatly enhanced by the plasmon resonance. Moreover, the traces generated by the movement of gold nanosphere dimers and trimers also provide a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale silicon patterns.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven nanomotors have attracted much attention due to their potential applications. The movement of conventional nanomotors typically occurs in the solution phase, which limits their application fields. Utilizing visible light to drive nanomotors at the solid&#8211;liquid interface represents a grand challenge due to the large friction force between the nanomotor and the solid surface. Based on the attractive plasmon resonance of Au nanocrystals, for the first time, plasmon&#8208;enhanced Au nanocrystal&#8208;based nanomotors moving at the silicon&#8211;aqueous solution interface have been developed. Such nanomotors move with a clear trace engraved on the Si surface, representing an excellent and exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. In addition, the nanomotor trace on the Si surface also provides a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale Si patterns, which is central to many applications, including microelectronics, sensing, information storage, and optoelectronics.

Moreover, the traces generated by the movement of gold nanosphere dimers and trimers also provide a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale silicon patterns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-driven nanomotors have attracted much attention due to their potential applications. The movement of conventional nanomotors typically occurs in the solution phase, which limits their application fields. Utilizing visible light to drive nanomotors at the solid&#8211;liquid interface represents a grand challenge due to the large friction force between the nanomotor and the solid surface. Based on the attractive plasmon resonance of Au nanocrystals, for the first time, plasmon-enhanced Au nanocrystal-based nanomotors moving at the silicon&#8211;aqueous solution interface have been developed. Such nanomotors move with a clear trace engraved on the Si surface, representing an excellent and exceptional self-traced nanomotor system. In addition, the nanomotor trace on the Si surface also provides a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale Si patterns, which is central to many applications, including microelectronics, sensing, information storage, and optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cathodic Electrodeposition of MOF Films Using Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films were made by cathodic electrodeposition using hydrogen peroxide as a pro&#8208;base whose single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials thus preventing the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extending the range of possible metal nodes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be made by cathodic electrodeposition, where a Br&#248;nsted base is formed electrochemically which deprotonates the MOF linkers that are present in solution as undissociated/partially dissociated weak acids. However, the co&#8208;deposition of metal and the narrow range of possible metal nodes limit the scope of this method. In this work, we propose the use of hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide assisted cathodic deposition or HPACD), to overcome these limitations. Electrochemical measurements indicate that in DMF, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to superoxide anions that deprotonate the carboxylic ligands. This single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials than all previous reported methods. This prevents the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extends the range of possible metal nodes. Various pure MOF films (HKUST&#8208;1, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) and MOF&#8208;5) were prepared via this approach. HPACD was also used for the preparation of patterned MOF films and of flexible Cu&#8208;BTC coated paper membranes which reject 99.1&#8201;% of Rose Bengal from water with a permeance of 8.4&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1.

         <title>Tailored Chiral Copper Selenide Nanochannels for Ultrasensitive Enantioselective Recognition and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral penicillamine&#8208;modified Cu2&#8722;xSe/AAO heterostructure membrane nanochannel was fabricated for the enantioselective detection of naproxen based on an electrochemical system.







Abstract
We constructed a tailorable membrane channel system consisting of penicillamine molecules intercalated in copper selenide nanoparticles (Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs), which exhibited circular dichroism (CD) bands in the near infrared region (CD, 800&#8211;1600&#8197;nm) with a maximum intensity of 164.5&#8197;mdeg at 1440&#8197;nm. The chiral ligand hybridized to the surface of achiral Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs by breaking the intrinsic symmetry of Cu2&#8722;xSe NPs and further large&#8208;scale assembly induced strong optical activity. The fabricated multilayer chiral membrane achieved an increased rectification ratio (RR) up to 114. The integration of penicillamine allowed for high enantioselective recognition against naproxen,which displayed high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.027&#8197;nM.

         <title>Nitrosobenzene&#8208;Enabled Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Construction of Atropisomeric N&#8208;Arylbenzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzimidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis is presented. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Described herein is an imidazole ring formation strategy for the synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles by means of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Two sets of conditions were developed to transform two classes of 2&#8208;naphthylamine derivatives into structurally diverse N&#8208;arylbenzimidazole atropisomers with excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as high levels of enantiocontrol. It is worth reflecting on the unique roles played by the nitroso group in this domino reaction. It functions as a linchpin by first offering an electrophilic site (N) for the initial C&#8722;N bond formation while the resulting amine performs the nucleophilic addition to form the second C&#8722;N bond. Additionally, it could facilitate the final oxidative aromatization as an oxidant. The atropisomeric products could be conveniently elaborated to a series of axially chiral derivatives, enabling the exploitation of N&#8208;arylbenzimidazoles for their potential utilities in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>A Systematic Study of the Effects of Complex Structure on Aryl Iodide Oxidative Addition at Bipyridyl&#8208;Ligated Gold(I) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An assessment of the effects of complex structure on the oxidative addition mechanism of aryl iodides at bipyridyl&#8208;ligated AuI&#8208;centers is described. It is shown that the hemilability of the bipy ligand and the electropositivity of the Au&#8208;center are important factors, leading to facile oxidative addition with electron&#8208;poor ligands and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides. These unusual observations contrast established Pd&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
A combined theoretical and experimental approach has been used to study the unusual mechanism of oxidative addition of aryl iodides to [bipyAu(C2H4)]+ complexes. The modular nature of this system allowed a systematic assessment of the effects of complex structure. Computational comparisons between cationic gold and the isolobal (neutral) Pd0 and Pt0 complexes revealed similar mechanistic features, but with oxidative addition being significantly favored for the group&#8197;10 metals. Further differences between Au and Pd were seen in experimental studies: studying reaction rates as a function of electronic and steric properties showed that ligands bearing more electron&#8208;poor functionality increase the rate of oxidative addition; in a complementary way, electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides give faster rates. This divergence in mechanism compared to Pd suggests that Ar&#8722;X oxidative addition with Au can underpin a broad range of new or complementary transformations.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly Induced Cell Membrane Phase Separation for Improved Peptide Drug Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vivo self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization and anticancer efficacy. KYp self&#8208;assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation and leakage on the cell membrane. The peptide drugs internalization is 2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide nanoparticle.







Abstract
Therapeutic peptides have been widely concerned, but their efficacy is limited by the inability to penetrate cell membranes, which is a key bottleneck in peptide drugs delivery. Herein, an in vivo self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization. A phosphopeptide KYp is synthesized, containing an anticancer peptide [KLAKLAK]2 (K) and a responsive moiety phosphorylated Y (Yp). After interacting with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), KYp can be dephosphorylated and self&#8208;assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein&#8208;lipid phase separation on cell membrane. Consequently, KYp internalization is 2&#8208;fold enhanced compared to non&#8208;responsive peptide, and IC50 value of KYp is approximately 5 times lower than that of free peptide.

     alt="In Vivo Self-Assembly Induced Cell Membrane Phase Separation for Improved Peptide Drug Internalization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in vivo self-assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization and anticancer efficacy. KYp self-assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein-lipid phase separation and leakage on the cell membrane. The peptide drugs internalization is 2-fold enhanced compared to non-responsive peptide nanoparticle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic peptides have been widely concerned, but their efficacy is limited by the inability to penetrate cell membranes, which is a key bottleneck in peptide drugs delivery. Herein, an in vivo self-assembly strategy is developed to induce phase separation of cell membrane that improves the peptide drugs internalization. A phosphopeptide KYp is synthesized, containing an anticancer peptide [KLAKLAK]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (K) and a responsive moiety phosphorylated Y (Yp). After interacting with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), KYp can be dephosphorylated and self-assembles in situ, which induces the aggregation of ALP and the protein-lipid phase separation on cell membrane. Consequently, KYp internalization is 2-fold enhanced compared to non-responsive peptide, and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of KYp is approximately 5 times lower than that of free peptide. Therefore, the in vivo self-assembly induced phase separation on cell membrane promises a new strategy to improve the drug delivery efficacy in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molten Salt Electrochemical Modulation of Iron&#8211;Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen consisting of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with highly grafted Fe3C nanoparticles is an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries owing to the facilitated adsorption&#8211;conversion process of lithium polysulfides.







Abstract
Sulfur hosts with rationally designed chemistry to confine and convert lithium polysulfides are of prime importance for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A molten salt electrochemical modulation of iron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen is herein demonstrated as formation of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with grafted Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@C@Fe3C), which is rationalized as an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Fe3C over nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon contributes to enhanced adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. The sulfur&#8208;loaded Fe3C@C@Fe3C electrodes hence show a high capacity, good cyclic stability, and enhanced rate performance. This work highlights the unique chemistry of metal carbides on facilitating adsorption&#8211;conversion process of lithium polysulfides, and also extends the scope of molten salt electrolysis to elaboration of energy materials.

         <title>A DNA Nanoflower&#8208;Assisted Separation&#8208;Free Nucleic Acid Detection Platform with a Commercial Pregnancy Test Strip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bound then free: DNA nanoflowers are used to immobilize a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#8208;modified DNA strand (hCG&#8208;DNA), which can be released by DNA amplicons from loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) via toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) and detected with an off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf pregnancy test strip (PTS) in a separation&#8208;free one&#8208;step process. The method is capable of achieving single&#8208;base resolution.







Abstract
There is a constant drive for affordable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) technologies for the detection of infectious human diseases. Herein, we report a simple platform for DNA detection that takes advantage of four techniques: commercially available pregnancy test strips (PTS), amplicon generation via loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, and noncovalent immobilization of DNA on paper surface with DNA nanoflowers. This simple, separation&#8208;free platform is highly specific, as demonstrated with the detection of rtL180M, a single&#8208;nucleotide polymorphism observed in hepatitis&#8197;B virus (HBV) associated with antiviral drug resistance. It is very sensitive, capable of detecting the targeted mutation at 2&#8197;copies&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1. It is able to correctly identify the unmutated and rtL180M genome types of HBV in clinical samples. Given its wide adaptability, we expect this platform can be easily modified for the detection of genetic variations associated with various pathogens and human diseases.

         <title>Molecular Encapsulation of Naphthalene Diimide (NDI) Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers: A Tool for Understanding Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates a novel synthetic strategy that can be used to tune the interstrand distance between conjugated polymers with unprecedented precision. This control provides an ideal platform for fundamental insight into the solid&#8208;state optical properties of NDI polymers.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are an important class of chromophores for optoelectronic devices. Understanding and controlling their excited state properties, in particular, radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes are among the greatest challenges that must be overcome. We report the synthesis and characterization of a molecularly encapsulated naphthalene diimide&#8208;based polymer, one of the most successfully used motifs, and explore its structural and optical properties. The molecular encapsulation enables a detailed understanding of the effect of interpolymer interactions. We reveal that the non&#8208;encapsulated analogue P(NDI&#8208;2OD&#8208;T) undergoes aggregation enhanced emission; an effect that is suppressed upon encapsulation due to an increasing &#960;&#8208;interchain stacking distance. This suggests that decreasing &#960;&#8208;stacking distances may be an attractive method to enhance the radiative properties of conjugated polymers in contrast to the current paradigm where it is viewed as a source of optical quenching.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts and understanding their underlying catalytic mechanism are of significant importance for the high&#8208;performance energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, we report novel CoCu&#8208;based bimetal&#8208;organic framework nanoboxes (CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs) as promising catalysts toward efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), fabricated via a successive cation and ligand exchange strategy. With the highly exposed bimetal centers and the well&#8208;designed architecture, the CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs show excellent OER activity and stability, with a small overpotential of 271 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.326 s  &#8208;1  at an overpotential of 300 mV. In combination of quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed CoCu&#8208;based oxyhydroxide analogue during OER is believed to account for the high OER activity of CoCu&#8208;MOF NBs, where the electronic synergy between Co and neighbouring Cu atoms promotes the O&#8208;O bond coupling toward fast OER kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Ladder of Ni3 Complexes with Closed&#8208;Shell, Mono&#8208;, and Diradical Triphenylene Units: Molecular Models for Conductive 2D MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23784-23789, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin coupling and electronic delocalization in trinickel clusters bridged by the radical&#8208;containing tritopic ligand 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP) was investigated. The HOTP spin state and strength of Ni&#8208;HOTP magnetic coupling can be tuned by consecutive HOTP&#8208;centered redox processes. The results provide inspiration for the design of new molecular and solid&#8208;state magnetic and electrically conductive materials.







Abstract
We report the isolation and characterization of a series of trinickel complexes with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP), [(Me3TPANi)3(HOTP)](BF4)n (Me3TPA=N,N,N&#8208;tris[(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl]amine) (n=2, 3, 4 for complexes 1, 2, 3). These complexes comprise a redox ladder whereby the HOTP core displays increasingly quinoidal character as its formal oxidation state changes from &#8722;4, to &#8722;3, and &#8722;2 in 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No formal oxidation state changes occur on Ni, allowing the isolation of singlet diradical, monoradical, and closed&#8208;shell configurations for HOTP in 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in the spin coupling strength upon oxidation. Because the three complexes can be considered models of the smallest building blocks of 2D conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks such as Ni9HOTP4, these results serve as possible inspiration for the construction of extended materials with targeted electric and magnetic properties.

&lt;p&gt;Spin coupling and electronic delocalization in trinickel clusters bridged by the radical-containing tritopic ligand 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP) was investigated. The HOTP spin state and strength of Ni-HOTP magnetic coupling can be tuned by consecutive HOTP-centered redox processes. The results provide inspiration for the design of new molecular and solid-state magnetic and electrically conductive materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the isolation and characterization of a series of trinickel complexes with 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaoxytriphenylene (HOTP), [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPANi)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HOTP)](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TPA=&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-tris[(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)methyl]amine) (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2, 3, 4 for complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). These complexes comprise a redox ladder whereby the HOTP core displays increasingly quinoidal character as its formal oxidation state changes from &#8722;4, to &#8722;3, and &#8722;2 in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. No formal oxidation state changes occur on Ni, allowing the isolation of singlet diradical, monoradical, and closed-shell configurations for HOTP in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in the spin coupling strength upon oxidation. Because the three complexes can be considered models of the smallest building blocks of 2D conductive metal-organic frameworks such as Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;HOTP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, these results serve as possible inspiration for the construction of extended materials with targeted electric and magnetic properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Allosteric Switching of Calmodulin in a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) Nanopore&#8208;Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23863-23870, October 25, 2021. </description>

The Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of calmodulin were distinguished by Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA). The D129G mutant of calmodulin was also discriminated. Interactions between calmodulin and other divalent ions were also detected, demonstrating high resolution structural profiling.







Abstract
Recent developments concerning large protein nanopores suggest a new approach to structure profiling of native folded proteins. In this work, the large vestibule of Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) and calmodulin (CaM), a Ca2+&#8208;binding protein, were used in the direct observation of the protein structure. Three conformers, including the Ca2+&#8208;free, Ca2+&#8208;bound, and target peptide&#8208;bound states of CaM, were unambiguously distinguished. A disease related mutant, CaM D129G was also discriminated by MspA, revealing how a single amino acid replacement can interfere with the Ca2+&#8208;binding capacity of the whole protein. The binding capacity and aggregation effect of CaM induced by different ions (Mg2+/Sr2+/Ba2+/Ca2+/Pb2+/Tb3+) were also investigated and the stability of MspA in extreme conditions was evaluated. This work demonstrates the most systematic single&#8208;molecule investigation of different allosteric conformers of CaM, acknowledging the high sensing resolution offered by the MspA nanopore trap.

         <title>A Desolvation&#8208;Free Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry for High Power Density and Extremely Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23858-23862, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery was fabricated by combining reversible anion doping in a polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode and co&#8208;intercalation of a Na+&#8208;solvent complex in an artificial graphite (AG) anode, which demonstrates super&#8208;fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (100C&#8208;rate) at 25&#8201;&#176;C, maintaining 61&#8201;% at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C compared to its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The development of conventional rechargeable batteries based on intercalation chemistry in the fields of fast charge and low temperature is generally hindered by the sluggish cation&#8208;desolvation process at the electrolyte/electrode interphase. To address this issue, a novel desolvation&#8208;free sodium dual&#8208;ion battery (SDIB) has been proposed by using artificial graphite (AG) as anode and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as cathode. Combining the cation solvent co&#8208;intercalation and anion storage chemistry, such a SDIB operated with ether&#8208;based electrolyte can intrinsically eliminate the sluggish desolvation process. Hence, it can exhibit an extremely fast kinetics of 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1 (corresponding to 100C&#8208;rate) with a high capacity retention of 45&#8201;%. Moreover, the desolvation&#8208;free mechanism endows the battery with 61&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity at an ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This advanced battery system will open a door for designing energy storage devices that require high power density and a wide operational temperature range.

Chromium(III) polypyridyl complexes typically emit in the red or NIR&#8208;I spectral region. We report a chromium(III) complex, which emits at 1067&#8197;nm at 77&#8197;K upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The combination of &#960;&#8208;donating amido with &#960;&#8208;accepting pyridine coordination units in a tridentate chelate ligand causes a strong nephelauxetic effect in a homoleptic CrIII complex, which shifts its luminescence to the NIR&#8208;II spectral range. Previously explored CrIII polypyridine complexes typically emit between 727 and 778&#8197;nm (in the red to NIR&#8208;I spectral region), and ligand design strategies have so far concentrated on optimizing the ligand field strength. The present work takes a fundamentally different approach and focusses on increasing metal&#8211;ligand bond covalence to shift the ruby&#8208;like 2E emission of CrIII to 1067&#8197;nm at 77&#8197;K.

         <title>Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Triggered by Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Initiated Chemiluminescence for Activated Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23805-23811, October 25, 2021. </description>

Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known tetrazole/alkene &#8220;photoclick&#8221; chemistry, a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered nanoparticle (NP) aggregation strategy was herein reported to activate the photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapeutic functions of gold NPs for specific visualization and efficient treatment of tumors in&#8197;vivo. This approach could provide a valuable tool for achieving precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Developing endogenous photo&#8208;activated theranostic platforms to overcome the limitation of low tissue&#8208;penetration from external light sources is highly significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. We report a H2O2&#8208;initiated chemiluminescence (CL)&#8208;triggered nanoparticle aggregation strategy to activate theranostic functions of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for effective tumor imaging and therapy. Two types of AuNPs (tAuNP &amp; mAuNP) were designed and fabricated by conjugating 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole and methacrylic acid onto the surface of AuNPs, respectively. Luminol was adsorbed onto the mAuNPs to afford self&#8208;illuminating mAuNP/Lu NPs that could produce strong CL by reaction with H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment, which triggers significant aggregation of AuNPs resulting in enhanced accumulation and retention of AuNPs for activated photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy of tumors. We thus believe that this approach may offer a promising tool for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Neutrophil&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe Development through Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;Cell Distinction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23743-23749, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly lipophilic fluorescent probe, NeutropG, has been developed for the specific distinction and imaging of human neutrophils over other blood cell types. The staining mechanism of neutrophil&#8208;selective NeutropG is achieved by metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis. NeutropG enters a neutrophil transported by CD36, then forms a lipid droplet with the help of ACSL and DGAT.







Abstract
Human neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes and have been considered as the first line of defence in the innate immune system. Selective imaging of live neutrophils will facilitate the in&#8197;situ study of neutrophils in infection or inflammation events as well as clinical diagnosis. However, small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based probes for the discrimination of live neutrophils among different granulocytes in human blood have yet to be reported. Herein, we report the first fluorescent probe NeutropG for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils. The selective staining mechanism of NeutropG is elucidated as metabolism&#8208;oriented live&#8208;cell distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis with the help of ACSL and DGAT. Finally, NeutropG is applied to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples by showing a high correlation with the current clinical method.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Fungal Drimane&#8208;Type Sesquiterpene Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23763-23770, October 25, 2021. </description>

Reported here is the complete elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters from Aspergillus calidoustus, including the first identified fungal drimenol cyclase. The cluster&#8208;associated acyltransferase is then employed to transfer different lengths of ACP&#8208;activated polyketides, but also very diverse CoA&#8208;esters.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes exhibit various biological activities and are widely present in eukaryotes. Here, we completely elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpene esters isolated from Aspergillus calidoustus and we discovered that it involves a drimenol cyclase having the same catalytic function previously only reported in plants. Moreover, since many fungal drimenol derivatives possess a &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone ring, we clarified the functions of the cluster&#8208;associated cytochrome P450 and FAD&#8208;binding oxidoreductase discovering that these two enzymes are solely responsible for the formation of those structures. Furthermore, swapping of the enoyl reductase domain in the identified polyketide synthase led to the production of metabolites containing various polyketide chains with different levels of saturation. These findings have deepened our understanding of how fungi synthesize drimane&#8208;type sesquiterpenes and the corresponding esters.

         <title>Interfacial Linkage and Carbon Encapsulation Enable Full Solution&#8208;Printed Perovskite Photovoltaics with Prolonged Lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23735-23742, October 25, 2021. </description>

A simple amphiphilic silane interfacial linkage strategy was employed to realize fully&#8208;printed all carbon&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a high efficiency of 18.64&#8201;%, accompanied by excellent device stability over 3000 hours.







Abstract
Simplified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with the perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) by a fully blade&#8208;coated process. A self&#8208;assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage. The AS serves as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221; to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, facilitating the interfacial charge extraction, increasing PCEs by 77&#8201;% and reducing hysteresis. A PCE of 18.64&#8201;% was achieved for the fully printed devices, one of the highest reported for carbon&#8208;based PSCs. AS&#8208;assisted interfacial linkage and carbon&#8208;material&#8208;assisted self&#8208;encapsulation enhance the stability of the PSCs, which did not experience performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for over 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>

Zeolite&#8208;tailored active site proximity, with well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm) confined within the internal cavities of zeolite&#8197;Y, significantly boosts the catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct hydrodeoxygenation of neat ethyl levulinate into pentanoic biofuels. Furthermore, La modification for zeolite&#8197;Y could improve the metal dispersion and the stability of zeolite during catalysis.







Abstract
Biofuel production can alleviate reliance on fossil resources and thus carbon dioxide emission. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite&#8197;Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot HDO of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. We have established and extended an understanding of the &#8220;intimacy criterion&#8221; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, leading to potential application for pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.

         <title>Energy Migration Control of Multimodal Emissions in an Er3+&#8208;Doped Nanostructure for Information Encryption and Deep&#8208;Learning Decoding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23790-23796, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of multimodal emissions has been demonstrated by a new type of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide nanocrystals (NCs). The multiresponse color&#8208;switchable output can be used for information security. Based on the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of these NCs and deep learning, it was possible to store and decode information in pork tissue by irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
Modulating the emission wavelengths of materials has always been a primary focus of fluorescence technology. Nanocrystals (NCs) doped with lanthanide ions with rich energy levels can produce a variety of emissions at different excitation wavelengths. However, the control of multimodal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er3+&#8208;based lanthanide NCs with color&#8208;switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535&#8197;nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR&#8208;II multimodal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.

However, the control of multimodal emissions of these ions has remained a challenge. Herein, we present a new composition of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-based lanthanide NCs with color-switchable output under irradiation with 980, 808, or 1535&#8197;nm light for information security. The variation of excitation wavelengths changes the intensity ratio of visible (Vis)/near-infrared (NIR-II) emissions. Taking advantage of the Vis/NIR-II multimodal emissions of NCs and deep learning, we successfully demonstrated the storage and decoding of visible light information in pork tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a TbIII&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23705-23712, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of TbIII in Ln&#8208;MOFs led to turn&#8208;on sensing of organic analytes regardless of quenching oscillators. The presence of such a remote interaction mechanism during the turn&#8208;on sensing event was verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and molecular dynamic modelling investigations.







Abstract
Guided by a second&#8208;sphere interaction strategy, we fabricated a Tb(III)&#8208;based metal&#8212;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for turn&#8208;on sensing of methyl amine with ultra&#8208;low detection limit and high turn&#8208;on efficiency. MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with secondary coordination spheres that are densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Nonradiative routes were inhibited by binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand on the second coordination sphere, resulting in luminescence amplification. Such remote interacting mechanism involved in the turn&#8208;on sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb(III) enabled the first turn&#8208;on sensing of organic amines in aqueous conditions. Our work suggests a promising strategy for high&#8208;performance turn&#8208;on sensing for Ln&#8208;MOFs and luminous materials driven by other metal chromophores.

         <title>Deep Learning for Voltammetric Sensing in a Living Animal Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23777-23783, October 25, 2021. </description>

A deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric (DLV) sensing platform is developed for highly selective and multiplexed analysis of neurochemicals in&#8197;vivo. With the DLV sensor, we reveal the interplay between the concentrations of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in the living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing methods. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite basic research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously in&#8197;vivo because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Herein, we present a deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric sensing platform for the highly selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in a living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial&#8208;temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplaying concentration changes of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Chemical Assembly in Living Cells by Integration of Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis and Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23797-23804, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The idea of using a molecular brake in materials science to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells is introduced. A tyrosine protection strategy enables the enzymatic cleavage site to be unmasked selectively by hydrolysis in the acidic environment of the lysosome. Cleavage of the P&#8722;N bond releases phosphotyrosine and enables enzyme&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly inside living cells spatiotemporally.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of chemical assembly in living cells remains challenging. We have now developed an efficient and general platform to precisely control the formation of assemblies in living cells. We introduced an O&#8208;[bis(dimethylamino)phosphono]tyrosine protection strategy in the self&#8208;assembly motif as the Trojan horse, whereby the programmed precursors resist hydrolysis by phosphatases on and inside cells because the unmasking of the enzymatic cleavage site occurs selectively in the acidic environment of lysosomes. After demonstrating the multistage self&#8208;assembly processes in&#8197;vitro by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS), cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM), and circular dichroism (CD), we investigated the formation of site&#8208;specific self&#8208;assembly in living cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), LC&#8208;MS, and biological electron microscopy (Bio&#8208;EM). Controlling chemical assembly in living systems spatiotemporally may have applications in supramolecular chemistry, materials science, synthetic biology, and chemical biology.

The use of a PEG&#8208;g&#8208;PVAc amphiphilic graft copolymer together with hydrophobic fragrances in aqueous medium leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidally stable suspensions of liquid coacervate droplets. Arrows indicate the local turbulences sustaining the spontaneous mixing of the components. The bottom panel shows the confocal Raman microspectroscopy mapping of a multicompartment coacervate droplet with carvone as fragrance.







Abstract
The high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. Herein, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Dominated Stable N97 Respirators for Airborne Virus Capture Based on Nanofibrous Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23756-23762, October 25, 2021. </description>

A polarity&#8208;driven air filtration approach is achieved based on the thin&#8208;film coated PAN nanofibrous membranes (TFPNMs), possessing a superior filtration efficiency reaching to N97 grade with outstanding longevity and reusability compared with the N95 FFRs. The TFPNMs can be reused upon various disinfection treatments, giving great potential for personal health care.







Abstract
The longevity and reusability of N95&#8208;grade filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin&#8208;film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long&#8208;lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42&#8197;Pa&#8722;1 (filtration efficiency: over 97&#8201;%; pressure drop: around 10&#8197;Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8211;0.41&#8197;Pa&#8722;1) tested with a flow rate of 5&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1 and the 0.26&#8197;&#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67&#8201;%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.

     alt="Polarity-Dominated Stable N97 Respirators for Airborne Virus Capture Based on Nanofibrous Membranes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polarity-driven air filtration approach is achieved based on the thin-film coated PAN nanofibrous membranes (TFPNMs), possessing a superior filtration efficiency reaching to N97 grade with outstanding longevity and reusability compared with the N95 FFRs. The TFPNMs can be reused upon various disinfection treatments, giving great potential for personal health care.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longevity and reusability of N95-grade filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin-film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long-lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42&#8197;Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (filtration efficiency: over 97&#8201;%; pressure drop: around 10&#8197;Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8211;0.41&#8197;Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) tested with a flow rate of 5&#8197;L&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the 0.26&#8197;&#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67&#8201;%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrrole Hemithioindigo Antimitotics with Near&#8208;Quantitative Bidirectional Photoswitching that Photocontrol Cellular Microtubule Dynamics with Single&#8208;Cell Precision**
</title>

Pyrrole hemithioindigos can be near&#8208;quantitatively photoisomerised by the laser wavelengths available on confocal microscopes. The first pyrrole hemithioindigo&#8208;based photopharmaceuticals, PHTubs, which are photoswitchable tubulin inhibitors, have been developed. PHTubs optically inhibit microtubule dynamics in live cells with single&#8208;cell, second&#8208;scale spatiotemporal precision, with both lit&#8208;active and dark&#8208;active compounds demonstrated in action.







Abstract
We report the first cellular application of the emerging near&#8208;quantitative photoswitch pyrrole hemithioindigo, by rationally designing photopharmaceutical PHTub inhibitors of the cytoskeletal protein tubulin. PHTubs allow simultaneous visible&#8208;light imaging and photoswitching in live cells, delivering cell&#8208;precise photomodulation of microtubule dynamics, and photocontrol over cell cycle progression and cell death. This is the first acute use of a hemithioindigo photopharmaceutical for high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution biological control in live cells. It additionally demonstrates the utility of near&#8208;quantitative photoswitches, by enabling a dark&#8208;active design to overcome residual background activity during cellular photopatterning. This work opens up new horizons for high&#8208;precision microtubule research using PHTubs and shows the cellular applicability of pyrrole hemithioindigo as a valuable scaffold for photocontrol of a range of other biological targets.

         <title>Engineering Dirhodium Artificial Metalloenzymes for Diazo Coupling Cascade Reactions**

Directed evolution was used to improve dirhodium metalloenzyme (ArM)&#8208;catalyzed diazo cross&#8208;coupling yield and selectivity. The ArM was then used in cascade reactions where the alkene product was reduced by an ene reductase, with the ArM scaffold controlling chemoselectivity in the reaction mixture. MD simulations show that the cofactor modulates the domain dynamics and favors a more closed, hydrophobic pocket conducive to selective catalysis.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are commonly used to control the stereoselectivity of catalytic reactions, but controlling chemoselectivity remains challenging. In this study, we engineer a dirhodium ArM to catalyze diazo cross&#8208;coupling to form an alkene that, in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction, is reduced to an alkane with high enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by an alkene reductase. The numerous protein and small molecule components required for the cascade reaction had minimal effect on ArM catalysis. Directed evolution of the ArM led to improved yields and E/Z selectivities for a variety of substrates, which translated to cascade reaction yields. MD simulations of ArM variants were used to understand the structural role of the cofactor on ArM conformational dynamics. These results highlight the ability of ArMs to control both catalyst stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity to enable reactions in complex media that would otherwise lead to undesired side reactions.

         <title>Photoinduced Radical Emission in a Coassembly System</title>

Coassembly systems are formed by doping carbonyl compounds into polyvinyl alcohol. After light irradiation the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network stabilizes the free radicals generated for the carbonyl compounds, leading to strong free&#8208;radical emission. Light/heat&#8208;controlled information encryption using these systems is demonstrated.







Abstract
Developing radical emission at ambient conditions is a challenging task since radical species are unstable in air. In the present work, we overcome this challenge by coassembling a series of tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzene molecules with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The strong hydrogen bonds between the guest dopants and the PVA host matrix protect the free radicals of carbonyl compounds after light irradiation, leading to strong solid state free radical emission. Changing temperature and peripheral functional groups of the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes can influence the intensity of the radical emission. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations predict that such free radical fluorescence originates from anti&#8208;Kasha D2&#8594;D0 vertical emission by the anion radicals. The photoinduced radical emission by the tricarbonyl&#8208;substituted benzenes was successfully utilized for information encryption application.

A bioorthogonal catalysis strategy has been developed inside a confined space using encapsulins equipped with HaloTag and [CpRu(hydroxyquinoline)(allyl)]PF6. The strategy opens up a toolbox for designing compartmentalized &#8220;new&#8208;to&#8208;biology&#8221; reactions inside living cells.







Abstract
Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently labeled encapsulins on a single&#8208;molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst via covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform in&#8197;vitro catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.

         <title>Strategies to Avoid Artifacts in Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Epitranscriptome Analyses</title>

         <dc:description>
For discovery of novel RNA modifications, a stringent workflow for structure validation is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of artifacts. The comparison of the synthetic standard to the native compound's retention time, full mass spectrum, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum and metabolic isotope labeling allow for confident identification of RNA modifications.







Abstract
In this report, we perform structure validation of recently reported RNA phosphorothioate (PT) modifications, a new set of epitranscriptome marks found in bacteria and eukaryotes including humans. By comparing synthetic PT&#8208;containing diribonucleotides with native species in RNA hydrolysates by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (MS), metabolic stable isotope labeling, and PT&#8208;specific iodine&#8208;desulfurization, we disprove the existence of PTs in RNA from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, human cell lines, and mouse brain. Furthermore, we discuss how an MS artifact led to the initial misidentification of 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methylated diribonucleotides as RNA phosphorothioates. To aid structure validation of new nucleic acid modifications, we present a detailed guideline for MS analysis of RNA hydrolysates, emphasizing how the chosen RNA hydrolysis protocol can be a decisive factor in discovering and quantifying RNA modifications in biological samples.

     alt="Strategies to Avoid Artifacts in Mass Spectrometry-Based Epitranscriptome Analyses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For discovery of novel RNA modifications, a stringent workflow for structure validation is necessary to avoid misinterpretation of artifacts. The comparison of the synthetic standard to the native compound's retention time, full mass spectrum, high-resolution mass spectrum and metabolic isotope labeling allow for confident identification of RNA modifications.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dissection of the Polar and Non&#8208;Polar Contributions to Aromatic Stacking Interactions in Solution</title>

A double&#8208;Hammett approach has been used to dissect out the polar contributions to the total aromatic stacking energy.







Abstract
Aromatic stacking interactions have been a matter of study and debate due to their crucial role in chemical and biological systems. The strong dependence on orientation and solvent together with the relatively small interaction energies have made evaluation and rationalization a challenge for experimental and theoretical chemists. We have used a supramolecular cage formed by two tris(pyridylmethyl)amines units to build chemical Double Mutant Cycles (DMC) for the experimental measurement of the free energies of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Extrapolating the substituent effects to remove the contribution due to electrostatic interactions reveals that there is a substantial contribution to the measured stacking interaction energies which is due to non&#8208;polar interactions (&#8722;3 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The perfectly flat nature of the surface of an aromatic ring gives &#960;&#8208;stacking an inherent advantage over non&#8208;polar interactions with alkyl groups and accounts for the wide&#8208;spread prevalence of stacking interactions in Nature.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Reverse Intersystem Crossing and Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophors with Multiple Through&#8208;space Charge Transfers</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescent molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donor&#8211;acceptor motifs are constructed to realize both fast radiative decay and reverse intersystem crossing, thanks to the enhanced multiple&#8208;charge transfers and near&#8208;degenerate excited states. The optimized device exhibits narrow&#8208;band green electroluminescence with a EQEmax/CIEy of 31.6&#8201;%/0.69, being the purest green bottom&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with through&#8208;space charge transfers (CT) have attracted particularly interest recently. However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative decay always limit their electroluminescence performances. Herein, TADF molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8208;acceptor (ortho&#8208;Dn&#8208;A) motif are developed to create near&#8208;degenerate excited states for the reinforcement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The incorporation of both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space CT enlarges oscillator strength. The optimal ortho&#8208;D3&#8208;A compound exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of ca. 100&#8201;%, a high RISC rate of 2.57&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a high radiative decay rate of 1.00&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously. With this compound as the sensitizer, a TADF&#8208;sensitized&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6&#8201;% with an ultrapure green Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinate value of 0.69.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Composites with Ordered Macropores and Hollow Walls</title>

Cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts with 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structures were successfully fabricated by using ordered macroporous ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 single crystals as precursors. This unique porous structure can greatly enhance mass transfer and accessibility of active sites to boost catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of furfural.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks provide versatile templates for the fabrication of various metal/carbon materials, but most of the derived composites possess only microspores, limiting the accessibility of embedded active sites. Herein, we report the construction of cobalt/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous and hollow&#8208;wall structure (H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/NC) using a single&#8208;crystal ordered macropore (SOM)&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 as precursor. During the pyrolysis, the interconnected macroporous structure of SOM&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8@ZIF&#8208;67 is mostly preserved, whereas the pore wall achieves a solid&#8208;to&#8208;hollow transformation with Co nanoparticles formed in the hollow walls. The 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous carbon skeleton may effectively promote long&#8208;range mass transfer and the hollow wall can facilitate local accessibility of active sites. This unique structure can greatly boost its catalytic activity in the selective hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived furfural to cyclopentanol, much superior to its counterparts without this well&#8208;designed hierarchically porous structure.

         <title>Identification of RNA Base Pairs and Complete Assignment of Nucleobase Resonances by Proton&#8208;Detected Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy at 100&#8197;kHz MAS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23903-23910, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed solid&#8208;state NMR experiments to detect base pair patterns in RNA. The experiments use high&#8208;sensitivity 1H&#8208;detection and allow site&#8208;specific assignment of base pairs to individual nucleotide spin&#8208;systems. In addition, the experiments yield full assignment of nucleobase resonances. The methodology is applicable to RNA embedded in particles of any size and provides rapid access to RNA secondary structure in biological complexes.







Abstract
Knowledge of RNA structure, either in isolation or in complex, is fundamental to understand the mechanism of cellular processes. Solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR) is applicable to high molecular&#8208;weight complexes and does not require crystallization; thus, it is well&#8208;suited to study RNA as part of large multicomponent assemblies. Recently, we solved the first structures of both RNA and an RNA&#8208;protein complex by ssNMR using conventional 13C&#8208; and 15N&#8208;detection. This approach is limited by the severe overlap of the RNA peaks together with the low sensitivity of multidimensional experiments. Here, we overcome the limitations in sensitivity and resolution by using 1H&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates. We develop experiments that allow the identification of complete nucleobase spin&#8208;systems together with their site&#8208;specific base pair pattern using sub&#8208;milligram quantities of one uniformly labelled RNA sample. These experiments provide rapid access to RNA secondary structure by ssNMR in protein&#8208;RNA complexes of any size.

Maleic acid derivatives are studied as cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability to existing reagents. A novel mechanism is described to readily access stable chloro&#8208;maleamic acid. The mild conditions, fast kinetics, and irreversible conjugation make this method an appealing alternative to existing cysteine&#8208;targeted methods.







Abstract
We describe maleic&#8208;acid derivatives as robust cysteine&#8208;selective reagents for protein labelling with comparable kinetics and superior stability relative to maleimides. Diamide and amido&#8208;ester derivatives proved to be efficient protein&#8208;labelling species with a common mechanism in which a spontaneous cyclization occurs upon addition to cysteine. Introduction of chlorine atoms in their structures triggers ring hydrolysis or further conjugation with adjacent residues, which results in conjugates that are completely resistant to retro&#8208;Michael reactions in the presence of biological thiols and human plasma. By controlling the microenvironment of the reactive site, we can control selectivity towards the hydrolytic pathway, forming homogeneous conjugates. The method is applicable to several scaffolds and enables conjugation of different payloads. The synthetic accessibility of these reagents and the mild conditions required for fast and complete conjugation together with the superior stability of the conjugates make this strategy an important alternative to maleimides in bioconjugation.

         <title>Mapping of N&#8722;C Bond Formation from a Series of Crystalline Peri&#8208;Substituted Naphthalenes by Charge Density and Solid&#8208;State NMR Methodologies</title>

A combination of charge density measurements, solid&#8208;state NMR 1JNC couplings, and DFT calculations is presented to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation for a series of model crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes.







Abstract
A combination of charge density studies and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1JNC coupling measurements supported by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to characterise the transition from an n&#8211;&#960;* interaction to bond formation between a nucleophilic nitrogen atom and an electrophilic sp2 carbon atom in a series of crystalline peri&#8208;substituted naphthalenes. As the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C distance reduces there is a sharp decrease in the Laplacian derived from increasing charge density between the two groups at ca. N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C = 1.8&#8197;&#197;, with the periodic DFT calculations predicting, and heteronuclear spin&#8208;echo NMR measurements confirming, the 1JNC couplings of &#8776;3&#8211;6&#8197;Hz for long C&#8722;N bonds (1.60&#8211;1.65&#8197;&#197;), and 1JNC couplings of &lt;1&#8197;Hz for N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C &gt;2.1&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23911-23916, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented thiiranation controlled by chiral dirhodium catalysts combined with a highly stereospecific thiirane reduction render the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination a stereoselective process (see scheme). The fourfold stereogenicity of pertinent overcrowded alkenes was thereby tractable with divergent stereocontrol, thus enabling access to all four stereoisomers from identical substrates.







Abstract
Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules owing to their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors, while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and with chiral auxiliaries. Herein we report that direct catalyst control is achieved by a stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination with enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol for various bistricyclic aromatic enes. Using Rh2(S&#8208;PTAD)4 as catalyst, several diazo compounds were selectively coupled with a thioketone to give one of the four anti&#8208;folded overcrowded alkene stereoisomers upon reduction. Complete stereodivergence was reached by catalyst control in combination with distinct thiirane reductions to provide all four stereoisomers with e.r. values of up to 99:1. We envision that this strategy will enable the synthesis of topologically unique overcrowded alkenes for functional materials, catalysis, energy&#8208; and electron transfer, and bioactive compounds.

Krypton difluoride and [XeF][AsF6] react in HF solvent at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to yield the first mixed KrII/XeII compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF. The structure and bonding of [FKrFXeF]+ were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations (ELF, AIM, NBO, and MEPS analyses). Upon warming, the compound undergoes redox decomposition in HF to yield mixed KrII/XeIV and KrII/XeVI species.







Abstract
Reaction of [XeF][AsF6] with excess KrF2 at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous HF (aHF) solvent has yielded the first mixed KrII/XeII noble&#8208;gas compound, [FKrFXeF][AsF6] &#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, a salt of the [FKrFXeF]+ cation. The potent oxidative fluorinating properties of KrII fluoride species resulted in oxidation of XeII to XeIV in aHF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form the mixed KrII/XeIV cocrystals, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4 and XeF4&#8901;KrF2. Further decomposition at 22&#8201;&#176;C resulted in oxidation of XeIV to XeVI to give the recently reported KrII/XeVI complexes, [F5Xe(FKrF)n][AsF6] (n=1, 2), [F5Xe][AsF6], and a new KrII/XeVI complex, [(F5Xe)2(&#956;&#8208;FKrF)(AsF6)2], which was characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) Raman spectroscopy. The [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF, ([Kr2F3][AsF6])2&#8901;XeF4&#8201;, and XeF4&#8901;KrF2 compounds were characterized by LT Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to assess the bonding in [FKrFXeF]+, [Kr2F3]+, and [Xe2F3]+ and to aid in their vibrational assignments.

         <title>An Air&#8208; and Water&#8208;Stable B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalene Serving as a Host Material for a Phosphorescent OLED</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23812-23818, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene (see structure) featuring a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap was synthesized and found to exhibit excellent thermal and chemical stability. The compound has a high T1 energy and can therefore emit short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence comparable to that of benzene. Owing to its photophysical properties, the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene served as a good host material for a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Replacement of the carbon&#8211;carbon bonds of antiaromatic compounds with polar boron&#8211;nitrogen bonds often provides isoelectronic BN compounds with excellent thermodynamic stability and interesting photophysical properties. By this element&#8208;substitution strategy, we synthesized a new B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene derivative, 1, which is fully substituted with mesityl groups. Owing to kinetic protection by the sterically bulky substituents, 1 is remarkably stable toward air and even water. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of 1 revealed the bonding characteristics of the B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene structure. In a glassy matrix, 1 emitted short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with an onset at 350&#8197;nm, indicating that the triplet energy is substantially high. DFT calculations reasonably explained the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state electronic structures of 1 as well as its emission properties. Motivated by the high&#8208;energy triplet state of 1, we used it as a host material to fabricate a phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency of 15&#8201;%.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Access to Dihydroquinoxalinones via Formal &#945;&#8208;Halo Acyl Halide Synthon in One Pot</title>

A one&#8208;pot catalytic and scalable Knoevenagel/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC) strategy towards medicinally significant dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano epoxides as new masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, is reported. Two out of the three steps are catalysed by highly robust, recyclable and easily available quinine&#8208;derived urea.







Abstract
An enantioselective one&#8208;pot catalytic strategy to dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring novel 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano enantioenriched epoxides as masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthons, followed by a domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC), is documented. A popular quinine&#8208;derived urea served as the catalyst in two out of the three steps performed in the same solvent using commercially available aldehydes, (phenylsulfonyl)acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide and 1,2&#8208;phenylendiamines. Medicinally relevant 3&#8208;aryl/alkyl&#8208;substituted heterocycles are isolated in generally good to high overall yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). A rare example of excellent reusability of an organocatalyst at higher scale, subjected to oxidative conditions, is demonstrated. Mechanistically, labile &#945;&#8208;ketosulfone has been detected as the intermediate involved in the DROC process. Theoretical calculations on the key epoxidation step rationalize the observed stereocontrol, highlighting the important role played by the sulfone group.

         <title>Controlling Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Using Multiplexed Conditional Guide RNAs for Cas12a**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23894-23902, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditional processing of Pol&#8201;II&#8208;transcribed Cas12a gRNAs for gene activation using three different activation modalities was achieved: RISC&#8208;based cleavage, an aptazyme, and an RNA strand displacement mechanism. Several switchable guide RNAs along with Cas12a itself can be integrated on a single transcript using a stabilizing triplex motif.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal control of the activity of CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) proteins is of considerable interest for basic research and therapeutics. Here, we show that conditional guide RNAs (gRNAs) for Cas12a can be transcribed in mammalian cells by RNA polymerase II, followed by activation via input&#8208;dependent processing of the 3&#8242; tail of the gRNA transcript. We demonstrate processing using an RNA strand displacement mechanism, as well as microRNA&#8208;dependent processing, and cleavage by a guanine&#8208;responsive ribozyme. We further demonstrate that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be compactly integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards Cas12a&#8208;based gene regulation constructs with multi&#8208;input switching capabilities. The principle is shown to work in HEK and mouse fibroblast cells using luminescence, fluorescence, and is also demonstrated for the conditional upregulation of an endogenous gene.

Aryl ethynylbenziodoxolones (ArEBXs) can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. In the excited state, ArEBXs act as strong oxidants, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides, and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs) are commonly used as radical traps in photocatalytic alkynylations. Herein, we report that aryl&#8208;substituted EBX reagents can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. They act as both oxidants and radical traps, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in several reported EBX&#8208;mediated processes, including decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides and the C&#8722;H alkynylation of THF. Furthermore, the method could be applied to the synthesis of alkynylated quaternary centers from tertiary alcohols via stable oxalate salts and from tertiary amines via aryl imines. A photocatalytic process using 4CzIPN as an organic dye was also developed for the deoxyalkynylation of oxalates.

         <title>Genetically Engineered Polypeptide Adhesive Coacervates for Surgical Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;swelling protein&#8208;based coacervate adhesives for in&#8197;vivo applications were fabricated by employing electrostatic complexation of supercharged polypeptides (SUPs) and oppositely charged surfactants. The adhesives exhibited superior performance compared to other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives. The outstanding adhesion performance, good biocompatibility, and biodegradability of SUP adhesives facilitate fast wound healing and skin regeneration.







Abstract
Adhesive hydrogels have been developed for wound healing applications. However, their adhesive performance is impaired dramatically due to their high swelling on wet tissues. To tackle this challenge, we fabricated a new type of non&#8208;swelling protein adhesive for underwater and in&#8197;vivo applications. In this soft material, the electrostatic complexation between supercharged polypeptides with oppositely charged surfactants containing 3,4&#8208;dihydroxylphenylalanine or azobenzene moieties plays an important role for the formation of ultra&#8208;strong adhesive coacervates. Remarkably, the adhesion capability is superior to commercial cyanoacrylate when tested in ambient conditions. Moreover, the adhesion is stronger than other reported protein&#8208;based adhesives in underwater environment. The ex vivo and in vivo experiments demonstrate the persistent adhesive performance and outstanding behaviors for wound sealing and healing.

A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses onto one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, that is, a post&#8208;translational modification or a structural hotspot in general, with three to five known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours as demonstrated by Vladislav&#8197;Y. Orekhov and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;23540 for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.

A mixed noble&#8208;gas cation described by Gary&#8197;J. Schrobilgen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;23678 was synthesized by reaction of KrF2 and [XeF][AsF6] in liquid HF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5&#8201;KrF2&#8901;2&#8201;HF. The V&#8208;shaped [FKrFXeF]+ cation, depicted as a space station, is in geosynchronous orbit over Hamilton where [FKrFXeF]+ was created and is being carefully monitored. To the east, decay of a sister station's orbit caused the station to warm, break up, and undergo redox decomposition to [F5Xe][AsF6], XeF4, and Kr as it enters Earth's atmosphere; a rescue shuttle speeds away from the disaster zone.

Amino acids and peptides are vital elements of metabolic and proteomic regulations. Non&#8208;invasive NMR and MRI techniques are highly suited for metabolomics diagnostics, but lack sufficient sensitivity. This Minireview summarizes the considerable advances in signal amplification through parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization of amino acids and peptides.







Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become a universal method for biochemical and biomedical studies, including metabolomics, proteomics, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By increasing the signal of selected molecules, the hyperpolarization of nuclear spin has expanded the reach of NMR and MRI even further (e.g. hyperpolarized solid&#8208;state NMR and metabolic imaging in&#8197;vivo). Parahydrogen (pH2) offers a fast and cost&#8208;efficient way to achieve hyperpolarization, and the last decade has seen extensive advances, including the synthesis of new tracers, catalysts, and transfer methods. The portfolio of hyperpolarized molecules now includes amino acids, which are of great interest for many applications. Here, we provide an overview of the current literature and developments in the hyperpolarization of amino acids and peptides.

         <title>Construction of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Molecular Nanocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23508-23532, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons have attracted increasing interest of late due to their fascinating structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties. This Review examines recent innovations in solution&#8208;phase and surface&#8208;assisted methods for their synthesis that have enabled the unprecedented exploration of these unique molecular architectures, as well as the intriguing properties of the nanocarbons obtained.







Abstract
Molecular nanocarbons containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behavior, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing. Heptagon incorporation can not only induce negative curvature within nanocarbon scaffolds, but also confer significantly altered properties through interaction with adjacent non&#8208;hexagonal rings. Despite the disclosure of several beautiful examples in recent years, synthetic strategies toward heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons remain relatively limited due to the intrinsic challenges of heptagon formation and incorporation into polyarene frameworks. In this Review, recent advances in solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons, as well as the intriguing properties of these frameworks, will be discussed.

         <title>Unraveling Hydrocarbon Pool Boosted Propane Aromatization on Gallium/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23630-23634, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrocarbon pool process is revealed in propane aromatization over Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Cyclopentenyl cations are observed and determined as active intermediates in propane conversion by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The formation of cyclopentenyl cations initiates autocatalysis of propane to aromatics in the induction period. The aromatization process is promoted by hydride transfer between propane and cyclopentenyl cations.







Abstract
Propane aromatization on metal&#8208;modified zeolites provides a promising route to produce valuable chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylene via non&#8208;petroleum feedstocks. The mechanistic understanding of propane conversion to aromatics is still challenging due to the complexity of the aromatization process. Herein, by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS, it is shown that cyclopentenyl cations are formed as active intermediates during propane aromatization on Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Autocatalysis of propane to aromatics is identified in the induction period. The cyclopentenyl cations serve as key hydrocarbon pool species to co&#8208;catalyze propane conversion and promote aromatics formation, revealing a dominant hydrocarbon pool process in propane aromatization.

         <title>Unambiguous Tracking of Protein Phosphorylation by Fast High&#8208;Resolution FOSY NMR**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23540-23544, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new suite of 2D FOSY experiments focuses on one coupled nuclear spin system at a time, that is, a PTM site or a structural hotspot in general, with 3&#8211;5 known frequencies. With higher sensitivity and versatility than achievable by traditional experiments, FOSY solves the spectral dispersion problem and obtains only the relevant local NMR signal assignment in a few hours, as demonstrated for two phosphorylation sites in the 441&#8208;residue IDP Tau.







Abstract
Dysregulation of post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) like phosphorylation is often involved in disease. NMR may elucidate exact loci and time courses of PTMs at atomic resolution and near&#8208;physiological conditions but requires signal assignment to individual atoms. Conventional NMR methods for this base on tedious global signal assignment that may often fail, as for large intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We present a sensitive, robust alternative to rapidly obtain only the local assignment near affected signals, based on FOcused SpectroscopY (FOSY) experiments using selective polarisation transfer (SPT). We prove its efficiency by identifying two phosphorylation sites of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3&#946;) in human Tau40, an IDP of 441 residues, where the extreme spectral dispersion in FOSY revealed unprimed phosphorylation also of Ser409. FOSY may broadly benefit NMR studies of PTMs and other hotspots in IDPs, including sites involved in molecular interactions.

Hierarchical organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx is smartly designed and exhibits superb potassium&#8208;storage properties, thanks to its unique properties including abundant contactable active sites, Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, electronic polarization, and strong coordination interactions, as shown by detailed experiments and theoretical calculations/simulations.







Abstract
Polyperylenediimide (PDI) is always subject to its modest conductivities, limited reversible active sites and inferior stability for potassium storage. To address these issues, herein, we firstly propose an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid (PDI@Fe&#8208;Sn@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx), where Fe/Sn single atoms are bound to the N&#8208;doped MXenes (N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) via the unsaturated Fe/Sn&#8211;N3 bonds, and functionalized with PDI via d&#8211;&#960; hybridization, forming a high conjugated &#948; skeleton. The resulted hybrid cathode endowed with enhanced electronic/ionic conductivities, lowered dissociation barriers of multiple redox centers and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase layer displays a 14&#8208;electron involved high&#8208;rate capacities and long cycle life. Moreover, it shows competitive performance in full cells even under different folding states and low operating temperatures.

A convenient method to obtain geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (1&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (1&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (1&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents, is reported. Selected examples of electrophiles were used to display the efficiency of 1&#8201;a,b as new building blocks in organometallic chemistry.







Abstract
We have synthesized the first isolable geminal bisenolates L2K2Ge[(CO)R]2 (R=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl (2&#8201;a,b), L=THF for (2&#8201;a) or [18]&#8208;crown&#8208;6 for (2&#8201;b)), a new synthon for the synthesis of organometallic reagents. The formation of these derivatives was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The UV/Vis spectra of these anions show three distinct bands, which were assigned by DFT calculations. The efficiency of 2&#8201;a,b to serve as new building block in macromolecular chemistry is demonstrated by the reactions with two different types of electrophiles (acid chlorides and alkyl halides). In all cases the salt metathesis reaction gave rise to novel Ge&#8208;based photoinitiators in good yields.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation for the Reductive Cyclisation of 2&#8208;Alkynyl Enones towards Trisubstituted Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23661-23666, October 25, 2021. </description>

InBr3 is used as functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation from &#947;&#8208;terpinene as H2 surrogate to initiate the cyclisation of 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;substituted enones to trisubstituted furans in good yields. Design of Experiments was used to optimise the reaction conditions with a few experiments to almost quantitative yields and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments gave valuable mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;&#8208;terpinene, to enones, which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan&#8211;indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent. In addition, a site&#8208;specific deuterium labelling of the dihydroaromatic HD surrogates resulted in site specific labelling of the products and gave useful insights into the reaction mechanism by H&#8211;D scrambling.

     alt="Indium-Catalysed Transfer Hydrogenation for the Reductive Cyclisation of 2-Alkynyl Enones towards Trisubstituted Furans"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is used as functional-group-tolerant catalyst for the transfer hydrogenation from &#947;-terpinene as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surrogate to initiate the cyclisation of 2-alkynyl-substituted enones to trisubstituted furans in good yields. &lt;i&gt;Design of Experiments&lt;/i&gt; was used to optimise the reaction conditions with a few experiments to almost quantitative yields and deuterium-labelling experiments gave valuable mechanistic insights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indium tribromide catalysed the transfer hydrogenation from dihydroaromatic compounds, such as the commercially available &#947;-terpinene, to enones, which resulted in the cyclisation to trisubstituted furan derivatives. The reaction was initiated by a Michael addition of a hydride nucleophile to the enone subunit followed by a Lewis-acid-assisted cyclisation and the formation of a furan&#8211;indium intermediate and a Wheland intermediate derived from the dihydroaromatic starting material. The product was formed by protonation from the Wheland complex and replaced the indium tribromide substituent. In addition, a site-specific deuterium labelling of the dihydroaromatic HD surrogates resulted in site specific labelling of the products and gave useful insights into the reaction mechanism by H&#8211;D scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine and Its Discrete &#960;&#8208;Stacked Homochiral Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23656-23660, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc phthalocyanine&#8208;[7]helicene hybrid molecular structure forms a discrete homochiral dimer and exhibits chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior also in a racemic mixture. The self&#8208;assembled dimeric structure shows remarkable stability in solution and the solid state, as well as effective electronic communication. The [7]helicene units induce an intense CD effect to the characteristic absorption band in the NIR region of phthalocyanine.







Abstract
In this communication, we demonstrate a novel approach to prepare a discrete dimer of chiral phthalocyanine (Pc) by exploiting the flexible molecular geometry of helicenes, which enables structural interlocking and strong aggregation tendency of Pcs. Synthesized [7]helicene&#8208;Pc hybrid molecular structure, zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine (Zn&#8208;7HPc), exclusively forms a stable dimeric pair consisting of two homochiral molecules. The dimerization constants were estimated to be as high as 8.96&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 3.42&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1 in THF and DMSO, respectively, indicating remarkable stability of dimer. In addition, Zn&#8208;7HPc exhibited chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior, which resulted in preferential formation of a homochiral dimer also in the racemic sample. Two phthalocyanine subunits in the dimeric form strongly communicate with each other as revealed by a large comproportionation constant and observation of an IV&#8208;CT band for the thermodynamically stable mixed&#8208;valence state.

A mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (MHOF)&#8208;confined biocatalytic cascade nanoreactor is constructed. This MHOF cascade nanoreactor has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient diffusion of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates and displays the advantages of superior activities, extended scope of substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables mimicking intracellular signal communications and complex chemical transformations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of using mesoporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) as the protecting scaffold to organize a biocatalytic cascade. The confined microenvironment of MHOFs has robust and large transport channels, allowing the efficient transport of a wide range of biocatalytic substrates. This new MHOF&#8208;confined cascade system shows superior activity, extended scope of catalytic substrates, and ultrahigh stability that enables the operation of complex chemical transformations in a porous carrier. In addition, the advantages of MHOF&#8208;confined cascades system for point&#8208;of&#8208;care biosensing are also demonstrated. This study highlights the advantages of HOFs as scaffold for multiple enzyme assemblies, which has huge potential for mimicking complex cellular transformation networks in a controllable manner.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity NIR&#8208;II Multiplexed Lifetime Bioimaging with Bright Double Interfaced Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23545-23551, October 25, 2021. </description>

We developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface nanoparticles with resembled strong fluorescence intensity and differentiable fluorescence lifetimes for high&#8208;fidelity in vivo lifetime multiplexed imaging.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging provides more possibility of in vivo multiplexing in second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. However, it still faces the obstacle that fluorescent probes with differentiable lifetime often exhibit quite different fluorescence intensity, especially the short lifetime usually accompanies with a weak fluorescence intensity, resulting in the difficulty for simultaneously decoding multiplexed lifetime information due to the interference of background noise. To facilitate high&#8208;fidelity lifetime multiplexed imaging, we developed a series of Er3+ doped double interface fluorescent nanoprobes (Er&#8208;DINPs): &#945;&#8208;NaYF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYbF4@NaErF4: Ce@NaYF4 with strong fluorescence intensity and easily distinguishable fluorescence lifetime. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results confirmed the advantage of these probes with comparable fluorescence intensity for high&#8208;fidelity multiplexed lifetime bioimaging.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Powered Activatable Nanozyme Breaking pH and H2O2 Limitations for Treating Diabetic Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23534-23539, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we communicate an activatable nanozyme with targeting capability to simultaneously break the local pH and H2O2 limitations under physiological conditions. Instead of synthesizing new nanomaterials, we solved physiological limitations on nanozymes by regulating the local microenvironment. This strategy is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.







Abstract
The peroxidase&#8208;like activity of nanozymes is promising for chemodynamic therapy by catalyzing H2O2 into .OH. However, for most nanozymes, this activity is optimal just in acidic solutions, while the pH of most physiological systems is beyond 7.0 (even &gt;8.0 in chronic wounds) with inadequate H2O2. We herein communicate an activatable nanozyme with targeting capability to simultaneously break the local pH and H2O2 limitations under physiological conditions. As a proof of concept, aptamer&#8208;functionalized nanozymes, glucose oxidase, and hyaluronic acid constitute an activatable nanocapsule &#8220;APGH&#8221;, which can be activated by bacteria&#8208;secreted hyaluronidase in infected wounds. Nanozymes bind onto bacteria through aptamer recognition, and glucose oxidation tunes the local pH down and supplements H2O2 for the in&#8208;situ generation of .OH on bacteria surfaces. The activity switching and enhanced antibacterial effect of the nanocapsule were verified in&#8197;vitro and in diabetic wounds. This strategy for directly regulating local microenvironment is generally accessible for nanozymes, and significant for facilitating biological applications of nanozymes.

Based on a chiral donor&#8211;acceptor copolymerization strategy, two pairs of chiral nonconjugated TADF polymers with low &#916;EST values and high PLQYs were constructed. The corresponding solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited intense CPEL signals and high device efficiencies with an EQEmax of up to 22.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
A strategy of chiral donor&#8211;acceptor copolymerization is proposed to develop chiral nonconjugated polymers with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Based on this strategy, two pairs of chiral polymers (R,R)&#8208;/(S,S)&#8208;pTpAcDPS and (R,R)&#8208;/(S,S)&#8208;pTpAcBP were synthesized. The alternating copolymerization of the chiral donors and acceptors could effectively separate the frontier molecular orbitals, which made the polymers show small &#916;EST of 0.01&#8211;0.03&#8197;eV and efficient TADF properties. Moreover, the polymers also showed the quantum yield of up to 92&#8201;% and the circularly polarized luminescence. The solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes showed circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 22.1&#8201;% and maximum luminance of up to 34350&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the first report of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral TADF polymer, which provides a useful and valuable guidance for the development of high&#8208;efficiency CPEL polymers.

         <title>Phosphorus Induced Electron Localization of Single Iron Sites for Boosted CO2 Electroreduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23614-23618, October 25, 2021. </description>

Single phosphorus atoms were successfully incorporated into a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds, which were demonstrated to promote CO2 electroreduction to CO at low overpotentials. The maximum CO faradaic efficiency was over 97&#8201;% at a low overpotential with a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals and fuels has recently attracted much interest, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. In this work, single P atoms were introduced into a N&#8208;doped carbon supported single Fe atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC/NPC) mainly in the form of P&#8722;C bonds for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. This catalyst exhibited a CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;97&#8201;% at a low overpotential of 320&#8197;mV, and a Tafel slope of only 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gold catalysts. Experimental analysis combined with DFT calculations suggested that single P atom in high coordination shells (n&#8805;3), in particular the third coordination shell of Fe center enhanced the electronic localization of Fe, which improved the stabilization of the key *COOH intermediate on Fe, leading to superior CO2 electrochemical reduction performance at low overpotentials.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,2&#8208;Difluorotetrahydrofurans through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23641-23645, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates was achieved with a broad substrate scope, low catalyst loading, good yields, and excellent enantioselectivities. The enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans were transformed to novel gem&#8208;difluorinated heterocyclic compounds.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans was accomplished via enantioselective formal [3+2] cycloaddition catalyzed by palladium. The asymmetric reaction between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and racemic vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates resulted in the formation of enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorotetrahydrofurans with an enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. Notably, the reaction used the readily available (R)&#8208;BINAP as the ligand at a low loading and yielded a wide variety of difluorinated products in moderate to high yields. Both chiral diastereomers could be obtained in a single sequence.

         <title>Doxorubicin&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence of NIR&#8208;Emitting Ytterbium Liposomes: Towards Direct Monitoring of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23574-23577, October 25, 2021. </description>

Doxorubicin&#8208;sensitized near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission of Yb3+ is observable in solutions of liposomes encapsulating the drug and amphiphilic Yb3+ complexes. This emission vanishes when the liposome is destroyed and doxorubicin is released. The NIR Yb3+ luminescence could be observed in living mice with a commercial macroscopic setup.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;loaded liposomes are typical examples of nanomedicines. We show here that doxorubicin, the anti&#8208;cancer agent in the liposomal drug Doxil, can sensitize Ytterbium (Yb3+) and generate its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission. When doxorubicin and amphiphilic Yb3+ chelates are incorporated into liposomes, the sensitized emission of Yb3+ is dependent on the integrity of the particles, which can be used to monitor drug release. We also established the first demonstration that the NIR Yb3+ emission signal is observable in living mice following intratumoral injection of the Yb3+&#8208;doxorubicin&#8208;liposomes, using a commercial macroscopic setup equipped with a NIR camera.

An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using a BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system. Chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins were obtained in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
An asymmetric hydrogenation of 3&#8208;benzoylaminocoumarins was achieved for the first time using our BridgePhos&#8208;Rh catalytic system, providing chiral 3&#8208;amino dihydrocoumarins in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.7&#8201;% ee). The relationship between the enantioselectivities of the hydrogenations and the dihedral angles and the resulting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking effects of the BridgePhos&#8208;Rh complexes, which were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, are discussed. The corresponding hydrogenated products allow for many transformations, providing several chiral skeletons with important physiological and pharmacological activities.

The relationship between the enantioselectivities of the hydrogenations and the dihedral angles and the resulting &#960;-&#960; stacking effects of the BridgePhos-Rh complexes, which were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis, are discussed. The corresponding hydrogenated products allow for many transformations, providing several chiral skeletons with important physiological and pharmacological activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with intramolecular hydrogen bonding are developed, which exhibit excellent photoluminescence efficiencies and large horizontal dipole ratios, and thus furnish the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art red and near infrared OLEDs, with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 31.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tailor&#8208;made red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules comprised of an electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrazino[2,3&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile core and various electron&#8208;donating triarylamines are developed. They can form intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding, which is conducive to improving emission efficiency and promoting horizontal orientation and show near infrared (NIR) emissions (692&#8211;710 nm) in neat films and red delayed fluorescence (606&#8211;630 nm) with high photoluminescence quantum yields (73&#8211;90%) in doped films. They prefer horizontal orientation with large horizontal dipole ratios in films, rendering high optical out&#8208;coupling factors (0.39&#8211;0.41). Their non&#8208;doped OLEDs exhibit NIR lights (716&#8211;748 nm) with maximum external quantum efficiencies (&#951;ext,max) of 1.0&#8211;1.9%. And their doped OLEDs radiate red lights (606&#8211;648 nm) and achieve record&#8208;beating &#951;ext,max of up to 31.5%. These new red TADF materials should have great potentials in display and lighting devices.

         <title>Identifying Reactive Sites and Surface Traps in Chalcopyrite Photocathodes</title>

Spectroelectrochemical and computational methods are combined to shed light on the promising reactivity of semiconductor chalcopyrites towards hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. A direct correlation between the PEC response and the chemical nature of the catalytic interface is presented, providing guidelines for engineering the performance of chalcopyrites.







Abstract
Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn0.3Ga0.7S2. We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In, and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite's performance and its surface's chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial for achieving high activity.

         <title>Thermoneutral N&#8722;H Bond Activation of Ammonia by a Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23625-23629, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing an NNS pincer ligand is reported. The steric and electronic parameters were tuned to allow for unprecedented reversible ammonia activation via N&#8722;H bond scission. The phosphine's electronic structure and the associated reaction mechanism of N&#8722;H bond scission are elucidated by derivatization reactions and computational methods.







Abstract
A geometrically constrained phosphine bearing a tridentate NNS pincer ligand is reported. The effect of the geometric constraint on the electronic structure was probed by theoretical calculations and derivatization reactions. Reactions with N&#8722;H bonds result in formation of cooperative addition products. The thermochemistry of these transformations is strongly dependent on the substrate, with ammonia activation being thermoneutral. This represents the first example of a molecular compound that reversibly activates ammonia via N&#8722;H bond scission in solution upon mild heating.

         <title>Harnessing Shape Complementarity for Upgraded Cyclohexane Purification through Adaptive Bottlenecked Pores in an Imidazole&#8208;Containing MOF</title>

The bottlenecked pores in an imidazole&#8208;containing MOF, namely MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13, can adapt in shape to specifically bind benzene molecules, making it desirable for upgraded purification to yield ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane in the late stage of industrial liquid&#8208;phase production.







Abstract
Shape complementarity is a biological craft for precisely binding substrates at protein&#8211;protein interfaces. An analogy to such a function can be drawn conceptually for crystalline porous solids; yet the manifested entities are rare in reticular chemistry. The bottleneck&#8208;shaped pores carved out of a metal&#8208;organic framework, Zn(MIBA)2 (aka. MAF&#8208;stu&#8208;13), can perfectly accommodate benzene molecules. Remarkably, its framework adapts to the optimal guest binding&#8208;the enhanced host&#8211;guest interactions in the neck in turn minimize the guest&#8208;guest repulsion in the pore to the extent it turns into attraction&#8208;as demonstrated by the combined X&#8208;ray structural and DFT computational studies. This adaptive material can be used for liquid&#8208;phase production of ultrahigh&#8208;purity (&#8805;99&#8201;%) cyclohexane, achieving a balance between uptake capacity and separation selectivity and surpassing the performances of other porous and nonporous crystals reported recently (e.g. product purity 99.4&#8201;% vs. 97.5&#8201;% to date).

         <title>Nano&#8208;analysis Reveals High Fraction of Serotonin Release during Exocytosis from a Gut Epithelium Model Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23552-23556, October 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gut&#8208;derived serotonin signaling plays key roles in the modulation of normal GI motility and inflammation. Electrochemical methods were used to study the release of serotonin during exocytosis in human carcinoid BON cells, which was found to be predominantly partial, with vesicles releasing a large fraction of serotonin during each exocytosis event. This finding provides new insights into therapeutic targets for treating GI diseases.







Abstract
Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5&#8208;HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in&#8197;vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut&#8208;derived 5&#8208;HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5&#8208;HT release in BON cells is 80&#8201;% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34&#8201;%). The fractional release increased from 80&#8201;% in control BON cells to 87&#8201;% with 5&#8208;HT preincubation and nearly 100&#8201;% with the combination of 5&#8208;HT and the 5&#8208;HT4 autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5&#8208;HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.

Electrochemical methods were used to study the release of serotonin during exocytosis in human carcinoid BON cells, which was found to be predominantly partial, with vesicles releasing a large fraction of serotonin during each exocytosis event. This finding provides new insights into therapeutic targets for treating GI diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical methods were used to explore the exocytotic nature of serotonin (5-HT) release in human carcinoid BON cells, an in&#8197;vitro human enterochromaffin cell model, to understand the mechanisms operating the release of gut-derived 5-HT in the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We show that the fractional vesicular 5-HT release in BON cells is 80&#8201;% compared to previous work in pancreatic beta cells (34&#8201;%). The fractional release increased from 80&#8201;% in control BON cells to 87&#8201;% with 5-HT preincubation and nearly 100&#8201;% with the combination of 5-HT and the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; autoreceptor agonist, cisapride. Thus, partial release is the primary mechanism of exocytosis in BON cells, resulting in a variable amount of the vesicular content being released. Factors that control secretion of 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells or BON cells are important as partial release provides a mechanism for development of effective therapeutic strategies to treat gastrointestinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Stabilized Organic Cocrystals for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 44, Page 23569-23573, October 25, 2021. </description>

Organic co&#8208;crystals are solid&#8208;state multifunctional materials with intriguing properties whereas the supramolecular interactions within co&#8208;crystals limited their stability in solution and their application in biology. Utilizing metal&#8211;organic framework to stabilize and strengthen the charge&#8208;transfer interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor, a water&#8208;dispersible co&#8208;crystal was obtained and applied in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and intriguing properties, but supramolecular interactions restrict their stability in aqueous solution, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we report on the first biological application of aqueous dispersible self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca2+ as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8211;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47&#8197;&#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be attained and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8&#8201;%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials; it is also much higher than that of the FDA approved photothermal agent ICG as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy.

         <title>Mechanical Force for the Transformation of Aziridine into Imine</title>

When cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine is incorporated into a macromolecular backbone, it undergoes structural transformation into an imine by mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;migration of the N&#8208;phthalimido group. The migration occurs under mechanochemical conditions but not thermal conditions. The imine is further hydrolyzed in the presence of water under ambient conditions, resulting in an amine and aldehyde.







Abstract
Force&#8208;selective mechanochemical reactions may be important for applications in polymer mechanochemistry, yet it is difficult to achieve such reactions. This paper reports that cis&#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine incorporated into a macromolecular backbone undergoes migration of N&#8208;phthalimido group to afford imine under mechanochemical condition and not thermal one. The imine is further hydrolyzed by water bifurcating into amine and aldehyde. These structural transformations are confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopic analyses. Computational simulations are conducted for the aziridine mechanophore to propose the mechanism of reaction and define the substrate scope of reaction.

2&#8208;Oxyenamides are introduced as novel, highly versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol scaffold. A Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated reaction of 2&#8208;oxyenamides with acylimine precursors and a terminal nucleophile enables a modular assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;ol structure bearing three continuous stereocenters with excellent levels of diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A highly diastereoselective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;alcohol unit bearing three continuous stereocenters is described. This method utilizes 2&#8208;oxyenamides as a novel type of building block for the rapid assembly of the 1,3&#8208;diamine scaffold containing an additional stereogenic oxygen functionality at the C2 position. A stereoselective preparation of the required (Z)&#8208;oxyenamides is reported as well.

         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative coupling of aliphatic N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents was achieved by dual photoredox and copper catalysis. This method allows the installation of alkyl groups on polyfluoroaryls with a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns.







Abstract
Polyfluoroarenes are an important class of compounds in medical and material chemistry. The synthesis of alkylated polyfluoroarenes remains challenging. Here we describe a decarboxylative coupling reaction of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with polyfluoroaryl zinc reagents (Zn&#8208;ArF) via synergetic photoredox and copper catalysis. This method readily converts primary and secondary alkyl carboxylic acids into the corresponding polyfluoroaryl compounds, which could have a wide range of F&#8208;content (2F&#8208;5F) and variable F&#8208;substitution patterns on the aryl groups. Broad scope and good functional group compatibility were achieved, including on substrates derived from natural products and pharmaceuticals. Mechanistic study revealed that a [Cu&#8208;(ArF)2] species could be responsible for the transfer of polyfluoroaryl groups to the alkyl radicals.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spin&#8208;Filtering Transport in Chiral Hybrid Copper Halides</title>

Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity in Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites creates a platform for organic spintronics. Combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and inoxidizability of halide ions, lead&#8208;free and air&#8208;stable chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 were synthesized by facile methods. These compounds offer efficient (&#8776;90&#8201;%) spin&#8208;filtering charge transport.







Abstract
Chiral Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites exhibit outstanding chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) performance, but the nontoxic lead&#8208;free hybrid materials with high stability are still greatly desired for spin filtering in spintronic applications. We synthesize chiral hybrid copper halides (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuX4 (MBA=methylbenzylammonium; X=Cl, Br) with characteristic 0D CuX4 tetrahedral structural motifs, combining the low toxicity of Cu2+ and air stability of halide ions (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;). Despite similar structural and electronic features, (R/S&#8208;MBA)2CuBr4 shows much smaller chiroptical activity than the chloride counterpart. Magnetically conductive atomic force microscopy measurements display a typical spin&#8208;polarized charge&#8208;transport property with high efficiency up to 90&#8201;% for both copper halides.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral-induced spin selectivity in Pb(Sn)-I hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites creates a platform for organic spintronics. Combining the low toxicity of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and inoxidizability of halide ions, lead-free and air-stable chiral hybrid copper halides (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-MBA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Chiral Arylamines, Alkylamines and Amides by Enantioselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination</title>

         <dc:description>
Three types of enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminations have been developed by using nitroarenes, hydroxylamines, or dioxazolones as aminating reagents. This modular process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral benzylic arylamines, alkylamines, and amides from styrenes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroarylamination, hydroalkylamination and hydroamidation of styrenes have been developed by NiH catalysis with a simple bioxazoline ligand under mild conditions. A wide range of enantioenriched benzylic arylamines, alkylamines and amides can be easily accessed by nitroarenes, hydroxylamines and dioxazolones, respectively as amination reagents. The chiral induction in these reactions is proposed to proceed through an enantiodifferentiating syn&#8208;hydronickellation step.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Fusion Cellular Vesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effectively activating host immunity against cancer has already become a promising therapeutic strategy. However, cancer cells resist to the host immune response through both innate and adaptive immune effectors. Especially, CD47 on tumor cells protects them from macrophage phagocytosis through interaction with SIRP&#945;, while PD&#8208;L1 interacts with its receptor PD&#8208;1 and dampens T cell&#8208;mediated tumor killing. Herein, we report that genetically programmable fusion cellular vesicles (Fus&#8208;CVs) displaying high&#8208;affinity SIRP&#945; variants and PD&#8208;1 can disable both mechanisms. Dual&#8208;blockade of CD47 and PD&#8208;L1 with Fus&#8208;CVs significantly increases the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages, promotes antigen presentation, and activates antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the bispecific targeting design of Fus&#8208;CVs ensures better targeting on tumor cells, but less on other cells, which reduces systemic side effects and enhances therapeutic efficacies. In malignant melanoma and mammary carcinoma models, we demonstrate that Fus&#8208;CVs significantly improve overall survival of model animals by inhibiting post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and metastasis. The Fus&#8208;CVs are suitable for protein display by genetic engineering. These advantages, integrated with other unique properties inherited from source cells, make Fus&#8208;CVs an attractive platform for multi&#8208;targeting immune checkpoint blockade therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Stereoselectivity and Substrate Acceptance of Enzymes: Proline Induced Loop Engineering Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein stability and evolvability influence each other, which has brought an explosion of interest in harnessing protein dynamics to access new functions. Although protein dynamics play essential roles in various catalytically important properties, their high flexibility and diversity makes it difficult to incorporate such properties into rational engineering. Therefore, how to unlock such potential evolvability in a user&#8208;friendly rational design process remains a key challenge. In this endeavor, we describe a method for engineering an enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). It enables synthetically important substrate acceptance for 4&#8208;chlorophenyl pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl ketone, as well as perfect stereocontrol of both (  S  )&#8208; and (  R  )&#8208;configured products. Thermodynamic analysis unveiled the subtle interaction between enzyme stability and evolvability, while computational studies provided insights into the origin of selectivity and substrate recognition. Preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of the (  S  )&#8208;product (73% yield; &gt;99%  ee  ) was performed on a gram&#8208;scale. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates that interfaced proline residues can be rationally engineered to unlock evolvability and thus provide access to ecologically and economically viable biocatalysts with highly improved catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Monofluoroalkylation: Strategies for the Synthesis of Alkyl Fluorides by C&#8211;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl fluorides modulate the conformation, lipophilicity, metabolic stability, and p  K  a  of compounds containing aliphatic motifs and, therefore, have been valuable for medicinal chemistry. Despite significant research in organofluorine chemistry, the synthesis of alkyl fluorides, especially chiral alkyl fluorides, remains a challenge. Most commonly, alkyl fluorides are prepared by the formation of C&#8211;F bonds (fluorination), and numerous strategies for nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical fluorination have been reported in recent years. Although strategies to access alkyl fluorides by C&#8211;C bond formation (monofluoroalkylation) are inherently convergent and complexity&#8208;generating, they have studied less than methods based on fluorination. This Review provides an overview of recent developments in the synthesis of chiral (enantioenriched or racemic) secondary and tertiary alkyl fluorides by monofluoroalkylation catalyzed by transition&#8208;metal complexes. We expect this contribution will illuminate the potential of monofluoroalkylations to simplify the synthesis of complex alkyl fluorides and suggest further research directions in this growing field.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Cationic Vacancy Defects: A Motif for Surface Restructuration of OER Precatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects have been found to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe&#8208;LDH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, their specific configuration and the role played in regulating the surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts remain ambiguous. Herein, cationic vacancy defects are generated from aprotic&#8208;solvent&#8208;solvation&#8208;induced leaking of metal cations from NiFe&#8208;LDH nanosheets. DFT calculation and in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopic observation both reveal that the as&#8208;generated cationic vacancy defects tend to exist as V  M  (M=Ni/Fe); under increasing applied voltage, they tend to assume the configuration V  MOH  , and eventually transform into the vacancy V  MOH&#8208;H  which is the most active yet most difficult to form thermodynamically. Meanwhile, the surface crystalline Ni(OH)  x  species in the NiFe&#8208;LDH is gradually converted into disordered status with increasing voltage; under sufficiently high voltage, when oxygen bubbles start to evolve, local NiOOH species become appearing, which is the residual product from the formation of vacancy V  MOH&#8208;H  . Thus, we demonstrate that the cationic defects evolve along with increasing applied voltage&#160; (V  M  &#187;&#160;V  MOH  &#187; V  MOH&#8208;H  ), and reveal the essential motif for the surface restructuration process of NiFe&#8208;LDH (crystalline Ni(OH)  x  &#187; disordered Ni(OH)  x  &#187; NiOOH). Our work provides insight into defect&#8208;induced surface restructuration behaviors of NiFe&#8208;LDH as a typical precatalyst for efficient OER electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Tertiary Electrophile (Hetero)Benzylation: Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Substitution of Isoprene Monoxide with Arylacetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective generation of quaternary carbon centers remains challenging but is of growing importance for the preparation of functional molecules. Metal catalyzed allylic alkylations of tertiary electrophiles have provided access to these substructures but remain generally incompatible with organometallic benzyl nucleophiles. Here we demonstrate that electron&#8208;deficient arylacetates can serve as benzyl nucleophile surrogates to generate enantioenriched acyclic molecules containing a quaternary carbon center via a two&#8208;step substitution&#8208;decarboxylation process using isoprene monoxide. Products are often obtained in &gt;90% ee using a commercially available catalyst. An array of electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups on the arylacetate moiety are tolerated. The lactone generated by the initial substitution reaction can be used in further stereoselective transformations to prepare molecules with acyclic vicinal quaternary stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>An Exceptional Thermally&#8208;Induced Four&#8208;State Nonlinear&#8208;Optical Switch Arising from Stepwise Molecular Dynamic Changes in a New Hybrid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switch materials in channel of nonlinear optics (NLO) are of particular interest in NLO material science. Numerous crystalline NLO switches emerged based on structural phase transition, but most of them reveal single&#8208;step switch between two different second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) states, very rare case involves three or more SHG states. Herein, we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid salt, (Me  3  NNH  2  )  2  [CdI  4  ], which is an unprecedented instance of reversible three&#8208;step NLO switches between SHG&#8208;silent, &#8208;medium, &#8208;low, and &#8208;high states, with high contrasts of ~25.5/4.3/9.2, respectively, in a temperature range of 213&#8211;303 K. By using the combined techniques of variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses, dielectric constants, solid&#8208;state  13  C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Hirshfeld surface analyses, we disclosed that this four&#8208;state switchable SHG behavior&#160;is highly associated with the stepwise changed molecular dynamics of the polar organic cations. This finding well demonstrates a complexity of molecular dynamics in simple hybrid salts&#160;and its&#160;potential in&#160;designing new advanced multi&#8208;step switching materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Alkyl Iodides Enabled by Aryl Radical Activation of Carbon&#8211;Iodine Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8211;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8211;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Proton Transfer Across a Table: The Formic Acid Dimer&#8211;Fluorobenzene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The experiment indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. The fluorobenzene environment slows down the proton transfer in this complex compared to the free formic acid dimer.







Abstract
Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The assignment of the spectrum indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. Each rotational transition of the parent isotopologue exhibits splitting. Isotopic substitution experiments show that the spectral splitting results from double&#8208;proton transfer tunneling in the formic acid dimer. Presence of fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule does not quench the double proton transfer in the formic acid dimer but decreases its tunneling splitting from 341(3)&#8197;MHz to 267.608(1)&#8197;MHz. Calculations suggest that the presence of the weakly bounded fluorobenzene does not influence the activation energy of the proton transfer. The fluorobenzene is reoriented with respect to the formic acid dimer during the course of the reaction, slowing down the proton transfer motion.

We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The experiment indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. The fluorobenzene environment slows down the proton transfer in this complex compared to the free formic acid dimer.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton transfer via tunneling is a fundamental quantum-mechanical phenomenon. We report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in the complex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The assignment of the spectrum indicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked structure. Each rotational transition of the parent isotopologue exhibits splitting. Isotopic substitution experiments show that the spectral splitting results from double-proton transfer tunneling in the formic acid dimer. Presence of fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule does not quench the double proton transfer in the formic acid dimer but decreases its tunneling splitting from 341(3)&#8197;MHz to 267.608(1)&#8197;MHz. Calculations suggest that the presence of the weakly bounded fluorobenzene does not influence the activation energy of the proton transfer. The fluorobenzene is reoriented with respect to the formic acid dimer during the course of the reaction, slowing down the proton transfer motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bridged Methylnaphthyl Palladium Dimers as Versatile Catalyst Precursors in Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide&#8208;bridged 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl palladium dimers are presented as convenient, yet highly efficient palladium sources for cross&#8208;coupling catalysis. The bench&#8208;stable complexes smoothly react with various ligands yielding monoligated palladium precatalysts. These display record&#8208;setting activity in various catalytic reactions, clearly beyond that achievable by ligand screening alone.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium dimers are presented as multipurpose Pd&#8208;precursors, ideally suited for catalytic method development and preparative organic synthesis. By simply mixing with phosphine or carbene ligands, they are in situ converted into well&#8208;defined monoligated complexes. Their catalytic performance was benchmarked against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems in challenging Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig, Heck, Suzuki and Negishi couplings, and ketone arylations. Their use enabled record&#8208;setting activities, beyond those achievable by optimization of the ligand alone. The MeNAP catalysts permit syntheses of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted arenes and bulky anilines in near&#8208;quantitative yields at room temperature, allow mono&#8208;arylations of small ketones, and enable so far elusive cross&#8208;couplings of secondary alkyl boronic acids with aryl chlorides.

         <title>Mechanism of the Photodegradation of A&#8208;D&#8208;A Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics**

The photodegradation pathway of acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini for organic photovoltaics was elucidated as a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift (see picture). This photoisomerization was accelerated under inert conditions, as explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction pathway.







Abstract
Herein, we elucidate the photodegradation pathway of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics. Using IT&#8208;4F as a benchmark example, we isolated the photoproducts and proved them isomers of IT&#8208;4F formed by a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift. This photoisomerization was accelerated under inert conditions, as explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction path (quenchable by oxygen). Adding controlled amounts of the photoproduct P1 to PM6:IT&#8208;4F bulk heterojunction cells led to a progressive decrease in photocurrent and fill factor attributed to its poor absorption and charge transport properties. The reaction is a general photodegradation pathway for a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini, and its rate varies with the structure of the donor and acceptor moiety.

         <title>Energy Band Alignment and Redox&#8208;active Sites in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Spaced Metal&#8208;Catechol Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new chemically&#8208;stable metalloporphyrin&#8208;bridged metal&#8208;catechol frameworks, InTCP&#8208;Co and FeTCP&#8208;Co, are constructed to achieve artificial photosynthesis without additional sacrificial agents and photosensitizers. The CO  2  photoreduction rate over FeTCP&#8208;Co considerably exceeds that obtained over InTCP&#8208;Co, and the incorporation of an uncoordinated hydroxyl group per catechol into the network further greatly promotes the photocatalytic activity. It could be explained by the fact that the iron&#8208;oxo coordination chain helps the energy band alignment and provides a redox&#8208;active site, and the uncoordinated hydroxyl group contributes to the visible&#8208;light absorptance, charge carrier transfer, and CO  2  &#8208;scaffold affinity. With a formic acid selectivity of 97.8%, FeTCP&#8208;OH&#8208;Co affords CO  2  photoconversion with a reaction rate 4.3 and 15.7 times higher than those of FeTCP&#8208; Co and InTCP&#8208;Co, respectively. These findings are also consistent with the spectroscopic study and DFT calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Critical Assessment of the Reducing Ability of Breslow&#8208;type Derivatives and Implications for Carbene&#8208;catalyzed Radical Reactions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of acyl azolium salts stemming from thiazolylidenes  C  NS  , triazolylidenes  C  TN,  mesoionic carbenes  C  MIC  and the generation of their corresponding radicals and enolates, covering about 60 Breslow&#8208;type derivatives. This study highlights the role of additives in the redox behavior of these compounds and unveils several critical misconceptions about radical transformations of aldehyde derivatives under N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. In particular, the reducing ability of enolates has been dramatically underestimated in the case of biomimetic  C  NS  . In contrast with previous electrochemical studies, we show that these catalytic intermediates can transfer electrons to iodobenzene within minutes at room temperature. Enols derived from  C  MIC  are not the previously claimed super electron donors, although enolate derivatives of  C  NS  and  C  MIC  are powerful reducing agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Control of Spiroketal Formation in Rubromycin Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]&#8208;spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]&#8208;spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]-spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin-dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]-spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon-carbon bonds. Our work illustrates an exceptional strategy for the biosynthesis of stable chroman spiroketals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Targeted DNA Crosslinking with cis&#8208;Platinum(II) Modified Triplex Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limitations of clinical platinum(II) therapeutics include systemic toxicity and inherent resistance. Modern approaches therefore seek new ways to deliver active platinum(II) to discrete nucleic acid targets. In the field of antigene therapy, triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) have attracted interest for their ability to specifically recognise extended duplex DNA targets. Here, we report a click chemistry&#8208;based approach that combines alkyne&#8208;modified TFOs with azide&#8208;bearing&#160;cis&#8208;platinum(II) complexes&#8212;based on cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin motifs&#8212;to generate a library of Pt(II)&#8208;TFO hybrids. These constructs can be assembled modularly and enable directed platinum(II) crosslinking to purine nucleobases on the target sequence under the guidance of the TFO. By covalently incorporating modifications of thiazole orange&#8212;a known DNA intercalating fluorophore&#8212;into Pt(II)&#8208;TFOs constructs, enhanced target binding and discrimination between target and&#160;  off  &#8208;target sequences was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Aminocarbonylations of Alkynes Enabled by Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy for the selective and divergent aminocarbonylation of alkynes with amines and 1 atm of CO is reported. This synergistic protocol not only enables the Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroaminocarbonylation of alkynes to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides, but also facilitates a sequential four&#8208;component hydroaminocarbonylation/radical alkylation in the presence of tertiary and secondary alkyl boronate esters, which allows for straightforward conversion of alkynes into corresponding amides. Preliminary mechanistic studies disclose that a photoinduced oxidative insertion of aniline and CO into nickel followed by a migratory insertion of (carbamoyl)nickel species could be involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction temperature is an important parameter to tune the selectivity and activity of electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) due to different thermodynamics of CO  2  RR and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, temperature&#8208;dependent CO  2  RR over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are investigated from 303 to 343 K. Increasing the reaction temperature improves and decreases CO Faradaic efficiency over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts at high overpotentials, respectively. CO current density over Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst increases with temperature, then gets into a plateau at 323 K, finally reaches the maximum value of 185.8 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 343 K. While CO current density over Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst achieves the maximum value of 252.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 323 K, and then drops significantly to 202.9 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 343 K. Temperature programmed desorption results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the difference of temperature&#8208;dependent variation on CO Faradaic efficiency and current density between Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts results from the varied adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates during CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dolabriferol C via a Highly Stereoselective One&#8208;Pot Coupling of a Meso 3,7&#8208;Diketone with Two Chiral Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis of the non&#8208;contiguous polypropionate dolabriferol C was achieved by retro&#8208;Claisen fragmentation of its putative contiguous precursor under mild conditions, establishing the former as a plausible isolation artifact. The precursor was prepared via a novel one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component bisaldol coupling of a  meso  (  Z,Z  )&#8208;bisenolate (generated in situ from a 3,7&#8208;diketone) with two enantioenriched aldehydes that sets the absolute configuration of 7 stereocenters in one step. The 1  st  aldol proceeds with enantioselective desymmetrization of the bisenolate to produce an enantiopure enolate&#8208;aldolate. Quenching at this stage enabled a streamlined synthesis of dolabriferol. Addition of a racemic aldehyde to the enolate&#8208;aldolate results in aldol coupling with kinetic resolution of the &#8216;matched&#8217; aldehyde; overall, a sequential enantiotopic group selective (SEGS) bisaldol. Because the desired adduct results from the &#8216;mismatched&#8217; aldol reaction, use of enantioenriched aldehyde was required.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of a highly active and stable metal&#8208;organic framework derived Ni&#8208;based catalyst for the photo&#8208;thermal reduction of CO  2  to CH  4  . Through the controlled pyrolysis of MOF&#8208;74 (Ni), the nature of the carbonaceous species and therefore photo&#8208;thermal performance can be tuned. CH  4  production rates of 488 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  under UV&#8211;visible&#8208;IR irradiation are achieved when the catalyst is prepared under optimized conditions. No particle aggregation or significant loss of activity were observed after five consecutive reaction cycles. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we performed an outdoor experiment under ambient solar irradiation, demonstrating the potential of our catalyst to reduce CO  2  to CH  4  using only solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Multivariate  Synergistic  Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with  Superproton  Conductivity  for  Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving proton conductivity and fabricating viable metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are central issues exploiting electrolyte MOFs. We aim to design multivariate flexibility synergistic strategy to achieve Flexible MOFs (FMOFs) with high conductivity&#160;at a wide range of humidity. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD)  &#160;and temperature&#8208;dependent Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT&#8208;IR) prove the synergistic self&#8208;adaption between dynamic torsion of alkyl sulfonic acid and dynamic breathing of FMOF, forming a continuous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks to maintain high conductivity.  Based on the convincing proton conductivity, we construct a series of  long&#8208;term durable MOF&#8208;based PEMs that serve as a bridge between MOF and fuel cell. Consequently, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of the flexible PMNS1&#8208;40 exhibits a maximum single&#8208;cell power density of 34.76 mW/cm  2&#160;  and  hopefully opens doors to evaluate the practical application of proton&#8208;conducting MOFs in direct methanol fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Structure Regulation: A Rod&#8208;Shaped Viologen Enables Long Lifetime in Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) derivative is firstly developed through a spatial structure regulation strategy for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). The obtained R&#8208;Vi features four individual methyl groups on 2,2',6,6'&#8208;position of the 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine core ring. The tethered methyls confine the movement of the alkyl chain as well as the sulfonic anion, thus driving the spatial structure from sigmoid to rod shape. The R&#8208;Vi with weak charge attraction and large molecular dimension displays an ultralow membrane permeability that is only 14.7% of that of typical sigmoid viologen. Moreover, the electron&#8208;donating effect of methyls endows R&#8208;Vi the lowest redox potential of &#8208;0.55 V vs SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologen&#8208;based AORFBs. The AORFB with R&#8208;Vi anolyte and K  4  Fe(CN)  6  catholyte exhibits an energy efficiency up to 87% and extremely low capacity fade rate of 0.007% per cycle in continuous 3200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Selection of Cyanines to Generate Conjugate Acid and Free Radicals for Photopolymerization upon Exposure at 860&#8201;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanines absorbing between 750&#8211;930&#8197;nm exhibiting distinct structural pattern with respect to terminal groups, polymethine length and substitution at the meso&#8208;position differently generate initiating radicals and conjugate acid for free radical polymerization and cationic self&#8208;polyaddition of vinyl ether in combination with diaryliodonium salt. Structural pattern of the cyanine importantly directs whether photochemistry proceeds or heat generates by coupling of vibrations&#8212;reminiscent of playing music where vibrations bring sound into the system as explained by Bernd Strehmel et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108713).

         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry&#160;combines semiconductors with biocatalysts for selective chemical synthesis powered by sunlight, but the overall energy conversion efficiency of these hybrid systems remained limited to date. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202110867), Erwin Reisner et&#8197;al. report the control of the local environment of a formate dehydrogenase integrated in a hierarchical porous TiO2&#160;scaffold. Its coupling to a lead halide perovskite&#8211;BiVO4&#160;tandem light absorber enabled a solar&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Impact of the Difluoromethylene Group in the Organocatalyzed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Difluorohydrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new interaction was discovered between C(sp3)F2 and an acylated chiral isothiourea, allowing an enantioselective recognition. This interaction was explored theoretically and experimentally in the kinetic resolution of racemic difluorohydrins, affording optically active organofluorines with a high level of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Due to the omnipresence of chiral organofluorine compounds in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material chemistry, the development of enantioselective methods for their preparation is highly desirable. In the present study, the enantioselective organocatalyzed acylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorohydrins using a commercially available chiral isothiourea is reported through a kinetic resolution (KR) process. It reveals that the difluoromethylene moiety (C(sp3)F2) can serve as a directing group through electrostatic fluorine&#8211;cation interactions, greatly improving the enantioselectivity of the KR. In this context, a broad range of fluorinated alcohols such as valuable 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols could be synthesized with exquisite enantiocontrol (typically &gt;99:1 er). Turning to 2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3&#8208;diols, we also demonstrated that aromatic and fluorinated groups were mutually compatible to provide the expected enantioenriched adducts with &gt;99:1 er.

         <dc:description>
Selective recognition of two stacked viologen radical cations in solution using a size&#8208;matched radical host is reported by J.&#8197;Fraser Stoddart et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109647). By employing 2,6&#8208;bismethylenenaphthalene as the linker, the bisradical dicationic host is able to accommodate two methyl viologen radical cation guests with strong and cooperative binding.

Ammonia has been converted to hydrazine, a chemical of utmost importance for organic synthesis and energy purpose. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109516), Fran&#231;ois J&#233;r&#244;me et&#8197;al. report that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous ammonia at a high frequency, act as micro&#8208;reactors to activate and convert ammonia to hydrazine at the gas&#8211;liquid interface. The aqueous solution maintained close to 30&#8201;&#176;C prevents the degradation of in&#8197;situ produced hydrazine.

         <title>Double Proton Transfer Across a Table: The Formic Acid Dimer&#8211;Fluorobenzene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With fluorobenzene as a neighboring molecule, the protons of the formic acid dimer can still switch through quantum tunneling as they do in the pure formic acid dimer. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, Weixing Li, Denis&#8197;S. Tikhonov, and Melanie Schnell present their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108242) and reveal the following mechanism: the neighboring fluorobenzene does not affect the reaction barrier but decreases the tunneling rate of the double&#8208;proton transfer of formic acid dimer. The molecular view on the environment reorganization in this proton&#8208;transfer reaction is a step towards understanding these reactions in a complex environment.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite Y and its ultra&#8208;stabilized hierarchical derivative (USY) are the most widely used zeolite&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts in oil refining, petrochemisty, and other chemicals manufacturing. After almost 60 years of academic and industrial research, their resilience is unique as no other catalyst displaced them from key processes such as FCC and hydrocracking. The present study highlights the key difference leading to the exceptional catalytic performance of USY  versus  the parent zeolite Y in a multi&#8208;technique study combining advanced spectroscopies (IR and solid&#8208;state NMR) and molecular modeling. The set of results highlights a hitherto unreported proton transfer involving inaccessible active sites in sodalite cages that contributes to the exceptional catalytic performance of USY.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable, Reagent&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergent Photocatalytic Carbocyclisation of Imine&#8208;Derived &#945;&#8208;Amino Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through judicious choice of reductant, a switchable diastereodivergent cyclisation of a single alkene&#8208;tethered imine, to either a trans&#8208;fused amino&#8208;indane or a cis&#8208;fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline structure, is herein described.







Abstract
A reagent&#8208;controlled stereodivergent carbocyclisation of aryl aldimine&#8208;derived, photocatalytically generated, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals possessing adjacent conjugated alkenes, affording either bicyclic or tetracyclic products, is described. Under net reductive conditions using commercial Hantzsch ester, the &#945;&#8208;amino radical species underwent a single stereoselective cyclisation to give trans&#8208;configured amino&#8208;indane structures in good yield, whereas using a substituted Hantzsch ester as a milder reductant afforded cis&#8208;fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline frameworks, resulting from two consecutive radical cyclisations. Judicious choice of the reaction conditions allowed libraries of both single and dual cyclisation products to be synthesised with high selectivity, notable predictability, and good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Computational analysis employing DFT revealed the reaction pathway and mechanistic rationale behind this finely balanced yet readily controlled photocatalytic system.

         <title>New Route to Battery Grade NaPF6 for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries: Expanding the Accessible Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the urgent need to produce high grade sodium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Our synthesis involves the addition of ammonium hexafluorophosphate to sodium metal under anhydrous conditions, which prevents the formation of NaF and other commonly found hydrolysis products seen in commercial samples. The high purity allows for up to 3&#8197;M electrolyte concentrations to be achieved.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium&#8208;ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high&#8208;grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of NaPF6 in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3&#8197;M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal&#8208;electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (&gt;2&#8197;M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1&#8197;M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.

         <title>Biocatalytic, Intermolecular C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution of P411 heme enzymes enables intermolecular C&#8722;H amidation with high yields and exquisite enantioselectivity. The biocatalytic process utilizes stable hydroxamate esters as nitrenoid precursors and is amenable to scaleup. Mechanistic studies reveal rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by a stepwise, hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Directed evolution of heme proteins has opened access to new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic activity that can be harnessed to tackle synthetic challenges. Among these, reactions resulting from active site iron&#8208;nitrenoid intermediates present a powerful strategy to forge C&#8722;N bonds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Here we report a biocatalytic, intermolecular benzylic C&#8722;H amidation reaction operating at mild and scalable conditions. With hydroxamate esters as nitrene precursors, feedstock aromatic compounds can be converted to chiral amides with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) and high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). Kinetic and computational analysis of the enzymatic reaction reveals rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by stepwise hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <dc:description>Analytical tests/devices that are used outside laboratory settings are required to have a very simple analytical protocol to get clearance by regulatory authorities. This study describes sink/float magnetic immunoassays, a new type of rapid, mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe, instrument&#8208;free tests for the detection of biomarkers in untreated biological samples that are very simple and might meet the simple&#8208;to&#8208;use criterium of authorities to be used in the field. These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8208;45 minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm&#8208;sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that use reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C&#8208;Reactive Protein, anti&#8208;  Treponema pallidum  antibodies and  E.coli  bacteria.</dc:description>

This manuscript describes the theory and proof-of-concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C-Reactive Protein, anti-  Treponema pallidum  antibodies and  E.coli  bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Tri&#8208;Mode Emission for Single&#8208;Component White Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of tri&#8208;mode afterglow is proposed to construct single&#8208;component white organic afterglow molecules by harvesting high&#8208;lying excitons on S1 and T1 for blue and low&#8208;lying excitons on T1* for yellow afterglow. After selectively modulating the intensity of yellow afterglow upon photoactivation, white organic afterglow with a lifetime up to 0.61&#8197;s and a quantum efficiency over 14&#8201;% was achieved.







Abstract
Achieving single&#8208;component white organic afterglow remains a great challenge owing to the difficulties in simultaneously supporting long&#8208;lived emissions from varied excited states of a molecule for complementary afterglow. Here, an extraordinary tri&#8208;mode emission from the radiative decays of singlet (S1), triplet (T1), and stabilized triplet (T1*) excited states was proposed to afford white afterglow through modulating the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) and exciton trapping depth (ETD). Low&#8208;lying T1* for yellow afterglow was constructed by H&#8208;aggregation engineering with large ETD and trace isomer doping, while high&#8208;lying T1 and S1 for blue afterglow with thermally activated emission feature were realized by reducing &#916;EST through donor&#8211;acceptor molecular design. Therefore, the single&#8208;component white afterglow with high efficiency of 14.1&#8201;% and a lifetime of 0.61&#8197;s was achieved by rationally regulating the afterglow intensity ratios of complementary emissions from S1, T1, and&#8197;T1*.

         <title>Hydroboration of Terminal Alkenes and trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diboration of Terminal Alkynes Catalyzed by a Manganese(I) Alkyl Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnI&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and the 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane is described. In the case of alkenes anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place, while in the case of alkynes the reaction proceeds with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
A MnI&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and a 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane (HBPin) is described. For alkenes, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place; for alkynes the reaction proceeds with excellent trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity. The most active pre&#8208;catalyst is bench&#8208;stable alkyl bisphosphine MnI complex fac&#8208;[Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3)]. The catalytic process is initiated by migratory insertion of a CO ligand into the Mn&#8211;alkyl bond to yield an acyl intermediate, which undergoes B&#8722;H bond cleavage of HBPin (for alkenes) and rapid C&#8722;H bond cleavage (for alkynes), forming the active MnI boryl and acetylide catalysts [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(BPin)] and [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(C&#8801;CR)], respectively. A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes was efficiently and selectively borylated. Mechanistic insights are provided based on experimental data and DFT calculations revealing that an acceptorless reaction is operating involving dihydrogen release.

         <title>Consecutive and Selective Double Methylene Insertion of Lithium Carbenoids to Isothiocyanates: A Direct Assembly of Four&#8208;Membered Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal CH2&#8722;CH2 homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. Two single nucleophilic CH2 units are delivered to an isothiocyanate as competent electrophilic partner, resulting in the assembly of an imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds.

         <title>Remote Arylative Substitution of Alkenes Possessing an Acetoxy Group via &#946;&#8208;Acetoxy Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group via nondissociative chain walking and &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote arylative substitution was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group to provide arylation products having an alkene moiety at the remote position. The use of &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination as a key step in the catalytic cycle allowed for regioselective formation of unstabilized alkenes after chain walking. This reaction was applicable to various arylboronic acids as well as alkene substrates.

The use of &#946;-acetoxy elimination as a key step in the catalytic cycle allowed for regioselective formation of unstabilized alkenes after chain walking. This reaction was applicable to various arylboronic acids as well as alkene substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facet&#8208;Selective Deposition of Ultrathin Al2O3 on Copper Nanocrystals for Highly Stable CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique was employed to selectively cover the (111) facets of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al2O3, which significantly increases the faradaic efficiency ratio of C2H4/CH4 in both H&#8208;type and GDE flow cells. This Al2O3 overcoating also effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and aggregation of Cu NCs during CO2RR.







Abstract
Catalysts based on Cu nanocrystals (NCs) for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion with high activity have been a subject of considerable interest, but poor stability and low selectivity for a single C2+ product remain obstacles for realizing sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral cycles. Here, we used the facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique to selectively cover the (111) surface of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al2O3 to increase the exposed facet ratio of (100)/(111), resulting in a faradaic efficiency ratio of C2H4/CH4 for overcoated Cu NCs 22 times higher than that for pure Cu NCs. Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al2O3&#8208;10C) reaches a C2H4 faradaic efficiency of 60.4&#8201;% at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell. Moreover, the Al2O3 overcoating effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and the aggregation of Cu NCs, which explains the negligible activity loss and selectivity degradations of Cu NCs/Al2O3&#8208;10C shown in stability tests.

         <title>Anion&#8211;Anion Chemistry with Mass&#8208;Selected Molecular Fragments on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion soft&#8208;landing was used to bind molecular fragment ions, generated in the gas phase, to molecular ions of same polarity by depositing them successively on surfaces. This can generate highly charged molecular ions which are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
While reactions between ions and neutral molecules in the gas phase have been studied extensively, reactions between molecular ions of same polarity remain relatively unexplored. Herein we show that reactions between fragment ions generated in the gas phase and molecular ions of the same polarity are possible by soft&#8208;landing of both reagents on surfaces. The reactive [B12I11]1&#8722; anion was deposited on a surface layer built up by landing the generally unreactive [B12I12]2&#8722;. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the generated material shows that [B24I23]3&#8722; was formed. A computational study shows that the product is metastable in the gas phase, but a charge&#8208;balanced environment of a grounded surface may stabilize the triply charged product, as suggested by model calculations. This opens new opportunities for the generation of highly charged clusters using unconventional building blocks from the gas phase.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Aromaticity Relief as an Approach to Stabilize Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radicals substituted with anti&#8208;aromatic rings have greater stability than radicals with aromatic substituents as a result of a new stereoelectronic stabilization approach driven by anti&#8208;aromaticity relief.







Abstract
A new strategy to stabilize free radicals electronically is described by conjugating formally antiaromatic substituents to the free radical. With an antiaromatic substituent, the radical acts as an electron sink to allow configuration mixing of a low&#8208;energy zwitterionic state that provides antiaromaticity relief to the substituent. A combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography, VT&#8208;EPR and VT&#8208;UV/Vis spectroscopy, as well as computational analysis, was used to investigate this phenomenon. We find that this strategy of antiaromaticity relief is successful at stabilizing radicals, but only if the antiaromatic substituent is constrained to be planar by synthetically imposed conformational restraints that enable state mixing. This work leads to the counterintuitive finding that increasing the antiaromaticity of the radical substituent leads to greater radical stability, providing proof of concept for a new stereoelectronic approach for stabilizing free radicals.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Collective Spin Excitations of a Triangulene&#8208;Based Nanostar</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A star&#8208;shaped triangulene cyclic hexamer, which accumulates 12 unpaired electrons, was prepared by combining solution chemistry and on&#8208;surface synthesis. The resulting triangulene&#8208;based nanostar was visualized by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy on a gold substrate. The collective spin excitations, explained by the Heisenberg model, were revealed by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy.







Abstract
Triangulene nanographenes are open&#8208;shell molecules with predicted high spin state due to the frustration of their conjugated network. Their long&#8208;sought synthesis became recently possible over a metal surface. Here, we present a macrocycle formed by six [3]triangulenes, which was obtained by combining the solution synthesis of a dimethylphenyl&#8208;anthracene cyclic hexamer and the on&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation of this precursor over a gold substrate. The resulting triangulene nanostar exhibits a collective spin state generated by the interaction of its 12 unpaired &#960;&#8208;electrons along the conjugated lattice, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering of six S=1 sites (one per triangulene unit). Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy resolved three spin excitations connecting the singlet ground state with triplet states. The nanostar behaves close to predictions from the Heisenberg model of an S=1 spin ring, representing a unique system to test collective spin modes in cyclic systems.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Difunctionalization of Cyclohexenyl Triflates Direct Access to Versatile Cyclohexenes via Cyclohexynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Difunctionalization of strained cyclic alkynes presents a powerful strategy to build richly functionalized cyclic alkenes in an expedient fashion. Herein we disclose an efficient and flexible approach to achieve carbohalogenation, dicarbofunctionalization, aminohalogenation and aminocarbonation of readily available cyclohexenyl triflates. We have demonstrated the novel use of zincate base/nucleophile system for effective formation of key cyclohexyne intermediates and selective addition of various carbon and nitrogen nucleophiles. Importantly, leveraging the resulting organozincates enables the incorporation of a broad range of electrophilic partners to deliver structurally diverse cyclohexene motifs. The importance and utility of this method is also exemplified by the modularity of this approach and the ease in which even highly complex polycyclic scaffolds can be accessed in one step.</dc:description>

         <title>Zr(OH)4 Catalyzed Controllable Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azoxybenzenes, Azobenzenes and Nitrosobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective oxidation of aniline to metastable and valuable azoxybenzene, azobenzene or nitrosobenzene has important practical significance in organic synthesis. However, uncontrollable selectivity and laborious synthesis of the expensive required catalysts severely hinder the uptake of these reactions in industrial settings. Herein, we have pioneered the discovery of Zr(OH)  4  as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst capable of the selective oxidation of aniline, using either peroxide or O  2  as oxidant, to selectively obtain various azoxybenzenes, symmetric/unsymmetric azobenzenes, as well as nitrosobenzenes, by simply regulating the reaction solvent, without the need for additives. Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the activation of H  2  O  2  and O  2  is primarily achieved by the bridging hydroxyl and terminal hydroxyl groups of Zr(OH)  4  respectively. The present work provides an economical and environmentally friendly strategy for the selective oxidation of aniline in industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Enrichment of Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Assemblies in Cancer Cell Lysosomes Turns Immunologically Cold Tumors Hot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death induced by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) has recently attracted increasing attention. However, nearly no studies show that currently available LMP inducers can evoke immunogenic cell death (ICD) or convert immunologically cold tumors to hot. Herein, we report a LMP inducer named TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY, which can respond to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leading to formation of nanoassembies along with fluorescence and singlet oxygen turn&#8208;on. TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY tends to accumulate in ALP&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell lysosomes as well as induce LMP and rupture of lysosomal membranes to massively evoke ICD. Such LMP&#8208;induced ICD effectively converts immunologically cold tumors to hot as evidenced by abundant CD8+ and CD4+ T cells infiltration into the cold tumors. Exposure of ALP&#8208;catalyzed nanoassemblies in cancer cell lysosomes to light further intensifies the processes of LMP, ICD and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor conversion. This work thus builds a new bridge between lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death and cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multi&#8208;layer Device for Light&#8208;triggered Hydrogen Production from Alkaline Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from methanol has attracted substantial interest because of the clean combustion of hydrogen and the convenience of methanol in storage and transportation. However, it requires high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure conditions to reform methanol with water to hydrogen with high turnover frequency (TOF, e.g. 10  4  moles of hydrogen per mole of Pt per hour). Here we show that hydrogen can be produced from alkaline methanol on a light&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;layer system with a very high hydrogen evolution rate up to ~1 &#956;mol/s under the illumination of a standard Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nitride. The system can achieve a remarkable TOF up to 1.8&#215;10  6  moles of hydrogen per mole of Pt per hour under mild conditions. The total turnover number (TTN) of 470,000 measured over 38 hours is among the highest reported. In addition, the system does not lead to any CO  x  emissions, hence it could feed clean hydrogen to fuel cells. In contrast to a slurry system, we show that the proposed multi&#8208;layer system avoids particle aggregation and leads to the effective use of light and Pt active sites. The performance is also attributed to the light&#8208;triggered reforming of alkaline methanol. This notable performance is a promising step toward practical light&#8208;driven hydrogen generation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Biomimetic Approach for Spatially&#8208;Controlled Cell Membrane Engineering Using Fusogenic Spherical Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering of cell plasma membrane using functional DNA is important for study and control of cellular behaviors. However, most efforts limit to apply artificial DNA interactions on external cell membrane due to the lack of suitable synthetic tools to engineer intracellular side, which impedes many applications in cell biology. Inspired by natural extracellular vesicle&#8208;cell fusion process, we introduce a fusogenic spherical nucleic acid construct to realize robust DNA functionalization on both external and internal cell surfaces via liposome fusion&#8208;based transport (LiFT), enabling applications including construction of heterotypic cell assembly for programmed signaling pathway and detection of intracellular metabolites. This approach can engineer cell membrane in a highly efficient and spatially&#8208;controlled manner, allowing for building anisotropic membrane structure with two orthogonal DNA functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rational Design of a Multifunctional 3D Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Borax Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional 3D cross&#8208;linked polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8208;borax layer possesses good electrolyte wettability, K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and structural stability, enabling a stable K plating and stripping process for more than 700&#8197;h of cycling without dendrite formation.







Abstract
K metal is the optimal anode for K&#8208;ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issues due to an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium&#8208;metal batteries, a 3D polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol&#8201;(PVA)&#8208;borax layer is designed, which enables a dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;plating/stripping process. The protective layer possesses good wettability, high K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;borax (PVA&#8208;borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25&#8201;% DOD and 50&#8201;% DOD, the PVA&#8208;borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180&#8197;h and 100&#8197;h, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Performant All&#8208;Organic Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by PTCDA Electrodes and a Hybrid Na/Mg Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PTCDA is for the first time implemented as an anode active material for aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries, with a novel &#8220;hybrid&#8221; aqueous electrolyte based on inexpensive non&#8208;fluorinated salts. The hybrid electrolyte supresses material dissolution during cycling and enables all&#8208;organic electrodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies.







Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all&#8208;organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non&#8208;fluorinated Na/Mg&#8208;salts, it displays favourable physico&#8208;chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &gt;3&#8197;V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long&#8208;term sustainability, and improved safety.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all-organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non-fluorinated Na/Mg-salts, it displays favourable physico-chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &amp;gt;3&#8197;V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water-in-salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long-term sustainability, and improved safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;Catalyzed Carbenium Ion Generation and Autocatalytic Pyrazole Synthesis&#8212;A Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions between vinyl diazoacetates and aryl esters afforded highly regioselective N&#8208;alkylated pyrazoles. These reactions involve an autocatalytic process in which in situ formed carbenium species act as a catalyst to regioselectively afford pyrazoles. Detailed DFT studies were carried out to explain the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In recent years, metal&#8208;free organic synthesis using triarylboranes as catalysts has become a prevalent research area. Herein we report a comprehensive computational and experimental study for the highly selective synthesis of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the generation of carbenium species from the reaction between aryl esters and vinyl diazoacetates in the presence of catalytic tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3]. DFT studies were undertaken to illuminate the reaction mechanism revealing that the in situ generation of a carbenium species acts as an autocatalyst to prompt the regiospecific formation of N&#8208;substituted pyrazoles in good to excellent yields (up to 81&#8201;%).

         <title>Remote C&#8211;H Pyridylation of Hydroxamates through Direct Photoexcitation of O&#8208;Aryl Oxime Pyridinium Intermediates**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an efficient strategy for the remote C&#8211;H pyridylation of hydroxamates with excellent ortho&#8208;selectivity by designing a new class of photon&#8208;absorbing O&#8208;aryl oxime pyridinium salts generated in situ from the corresponding pyridines and hydroxamates. When irradiated by visible light, the photoexcitation of oxime pyridinium intermediates generates iminyl radicals via the photolytic N&#8211;O bond cleavage, which does not require an external photocatalyst. The efficiency of light absorption and N&#8722;O bond cleavage of the oxime pyridinium salts can be modulated through the electronic effect of substitution on the O&#8208;aryl ring. The resultant iminyl radicals enable the installation of pyridyl rings at &#947;&#8208;CN position, which yields synthetically valuable C2&#8208;substituted pyridyl derivatives. This novel synthetic approach provides significant advantages in terms of both efficiency and simplicity and exhibits broad functional group tolerance in complex settings under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids Provide Insight into the Mechanisms of CYP152 Peroxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a cis or trans C&#945;=C&#946; double bond in unsaturated fatty acid substrates dramatically changes the catalytic efficiency and chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity of three representative CYP152 peroxygenases including OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, and P450BS&#946;, which provides new insights into their unusual catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
CYP152 peroxygenases catalyze decarboxylation and hydroxylation of fatty acids using H2O2 as cofactor. To understand the molecular basis for the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of these unique P450 enzymes, we analyze the activities of three CYP152 peroxygenases (OleTJE, P450SP&#945;, P450BS&#946;) towards cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;dodecenoic acids as substrate probes. The unexpected 6S&#8208;hydroxylation of the trans&#8208;isomer and 4R&#8208;hydroxylation of the cis&#8208;isomer by OleTJE, and molecular docking results suggest that the unprecedented selectivity is due to OleTJE&#8217;s preference of C2&#8722;C3 cis&#8208;configuration. In addition to the common epoxide products, undecanal is the unexpected major product of P450SP&#945; and P450BS&#946; regardless of the cis/trans&#8208;configuration of substrates. The combined H218O2 tracing experiments, MD simulations, and QM/MM calculations unravel an unusual mechanism for Compound&#8197;I&#8208;mediated aldehyde formation in which the active site water derived from H2O2 activation is involved in the generation of a four&#8208;membered ring lactone intermediate. These findings provide new insights into the unusual mechanisms of CYP152 peroxygenases.

         <title>Azepine&#8208; or Azocine&#8208;Embedded Hexabenzocoronene Derivatives as Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Saddle or Saddle&#8208;Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographenes bearing an azepine ring and an azocine ring, respectively, were synthesized and saddle&#8208;shaped and saddle&#8208;helix structures were obtained. Notably, two synthetic routes were adopted for the synthesis, the azepine&#8208;embedded polyaromatic was prepared by using cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide instead of typical alkyne and tetraphenylcyclopenta&#8208;2,4&#8208;dien&#8208;1&#8208;one.







Abstract
Two novel nitrogen&#8208;doped, hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based nanographenes (NGs) 1 and 2 bearing an azepine and an azocine at the fjord region, respectively, were synthesized and characterized. Notably, structure 1 was synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cyclic alkene and tetrachlorothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide, followed by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and Scholl&#8208;type reactions, which represents a modified strategy to construct NGs. The azo&#8208;heptagon&#8208;embedded NG 1 leads to a saddle shape, and the azo&#8208;octagon&#8208;embedded NG 2 exhibits a distorted saddle&#8208;helix conformation with the largest torsion angle recorded so far in [5]helicenes. As a result, the different structural topographies for NGs 1 and 2 lead to significant changes in the optical properties including UV absorption and fluorescent emission. Additionally, the 8&#960;&#8208;heterocycles azepine and azocine in the NGs 1 and 2 exhibited obvious antiaromatic properties.

         <title>Vertical Graphene Arrays as Electrodes for Ultra&#8208;High Energy Density AC Line&#8208;Filtering Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric&#8208;field assisted PECVD method was developed to grow strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) as electrode materials of ECs. The EC&#8208;SVGAs with aqueous or organic electrolyte exhibit excellent CA of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2, &#934; of 80.6&#176;, and energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 120&#8197;Hz with arbitrary AC filtering performances, which is far better than most carbon&#8208;related devices, demonstrating the potential for replacement of conventional AECs.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).

&lt;p&gt;An electric-field assisted PECVD method was developed to grow strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) as electrode materials of ECs. The EC-SVGAs with aqueous or organic electrolyte exhibit excellent &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt; of 80.6&#176;, and energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 120&#8197;Hz with arbitrary AC filtering performances, which is far better than most carbon-related devices, demonstrating the potential for replacement of conventional AECs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). However, current electrodes are stuck in limited electrode area and tortuous ion transport. Herein, strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) prepared by electric-field-assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition have been successfully designed as the main electrode to ensure ions rapidly adsorb/desorb in richly available graphene surface. SVGAs exhibit an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 1.72&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;120&lt;/sub&gt;=80.6&#176; even after 500&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, which is far better than that of most carbon-related materials. Impressively, the output voltage could also be improved to 2.5&#8197;V when using organic electrolyte. An ultra-high energy density of 0.33&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; can also be handily achieved.

         <title>Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Relevant 2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;Aminochroman Derivatives via Enzymatic Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biocatalytic synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives was achieved with imine reductases (IREDs) at preparative scale, showing enantiocomplementary selectivity for most of the products and yields as high as 91&#8201;%. Precursors of Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT were successfully synthesised, as well as the Parkinson's disease agent Rotigotine in a 3&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminotetralin and 3&#8208;aminochroman derivatives are key structural motifs present in a wide range of pharmaceutically important molecules. Herein, we report an effective biocatalytic approach towards these molecules through the enantioselective reductive coupling of 2&#8208;tetralones and 3&#8208;chromanones with a diverse range of primary amine partners. Metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs) were employed as the biocatalysts, obtaining high yields and enantiocomplementary selectivity for &gt;15 examples at preparative scale, including the precursors to Ebalzotan, Robalzotan, Alnespirone and 5&#8208;OH&#8208;DPAT. We also present a convergent chemo&#8208;enzymatic total synthesis of the Parkinson's disease therapy Rotigotine in 63&#8201;% overall yield and 92&#8201;% ee.

         <dc:description>
Here we established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the introduction of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems into one side of the hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannels. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels.







Abstract
Inspired by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), herein we have established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the ingenious introduction of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8211;guest system into one side of artificial hour&#8208;glass shaped nanochannel. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels. In view of these promising results, the use of artificial nanochannel to improve protein transport not only presents a new potential chemical model for biological research and better understanding of protein transport behavior in the living systems, but also provides a high&#8208;flux protein transporter device, which may have applications in the design of protein drug release systems, protein separation systems and microfluidics in the near future.

         <dc:description>Carbocations such as cyclic carbenium ions are important intermediates in zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction. The MTO reaction propagates through complex hydrocarbon pool process. Molecular understanding of the carbocation&#8208;involved hydrocarbon pool reaction still remains challenging. Here we show that electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentenyl cations stabilized in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite are able to capture alkane, methanol and olefins produced during MTO reaction via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Intermolecular spatial proximities/interactions are identified by using two&#8208;dimensional  13  C&#8208;  13  C correlation solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Combined NMR experiments and theoretical analysis suggests that in addition to the dispersion and CH/&#960; interactions, the multiple functional groups in the cyclopentenyl cations produce strong attractive force via cation&#8208;induced dipole, cation&#8208;dipole and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Sterically Wrapped Multiple Resonance Fluorophors for Suppression of Concentration Quenching and Spectrum Broadening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance (MR) emitters are promising for highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrowband emission; however, they still face intractable challenges with concentration&#8208;caused emission quenching, exciton annihilation, and spectral broadening. In this study, sterically wrapped MR dopants with a fluorescent MR core sandwiched by bulk substituents were developed to address the intractable challenges by reducing intermolecular interactions. Consequently, high photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields of &#8805;90% and small full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of &#8804;25 nm over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1 wt%&#8208;20 wt%) were recorded. In addition, we demonstrated that the sandwiched MR emitter can effectively suppress Dexter interaction when doped in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, eliminating exciton loss through dopant triplet. Within the above dopant concentration range, the optimal emitter realizes remarkably high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.3%&#8208;37.2%, identical small FWHMs of 24 nm, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;offs in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although ether&#8208;based electrolytes have been extensively applied in anode evaluation of batteries, anodic instability arising from solvent oxidability is always a tremendous obstacle to matching with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Herein,   by rational design for solvation configuration, the fully coordinated   ether&#8208;based electrolyte with strong resistance against oxidation is reported, which remains anodically stable with high&#8208;voltage Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  2  O  2  F (NVPF) cathode under 4.5 V (versus Na  +  /Na) protected by an effective interphase   . The assembled   graphite//NVPF full cells  display  superior rate performance and  unprecedented cycling stability.  Beyond that  , the constructed full cells coupling the high&#8208;voltage NVPF cathode with both hard carbon and graphite anodes exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances in terms of high average output voltage up to 3.72 V, long&#8208;term cycle life (such as 95 % capacity retention after 700 cycles) and high energy density (247 W h kg  &#8208;1  ).  In short, the optimized ether&#8208;based electrolyte enriches systematic options, the ability to maintain oxidative stability and compatibility with various anodes, exhibiting attractive prospects for application.</dc:description>

Beyond that  , the constructed full cells coupling the high-voltage NVPF cathode with both hard carbon and graphite anodes exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances in terms of high average output voltage up to 3.72 V, long-term cycle life (such as 95 % capacity retention after 700 cycles) and high energy density (247 W h kg  -1  ).  In short, the optimized ether-based electrolyte enriches systematic options, the ability to maintain oxidative stability and compatibility with various anodes, exhibiting attractive prospects for application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific 5&#8208;Formyl Cytosine Mediated DNA&#8208;Histone Cross&#8208;Links: Synthesis and Polymerase Bypass by Human DNA Polymerase &#951;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;Protein Cross&#8208;links (DPCs) between DNA epigenetic mark 5&#8208;formylC and lysine residues of histone proteins spontaneously form in human cells. Such conjugates are likely to influence chromatin structure and mediate DNA replication, transcription, and repair, but are challenging to study due to their reversible nature. Here we report the construction of site specific, hydrolytically stable DPCs between 5fdC in DNA and K4 of histone H3 and an investigation of their effects on DNA replication. Our approach employs oxime ligation, allowing for site&#8208;specific conjugation of histones to DNA under physiological conditions. Primer extension experiments revealed that histone H3&#8208;DNA crosslinks blocked DNA synthesis by hPol &#951; polymerase, but were bypassed following proteolytic processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Growth of Preferred&#8208;Oriented MOF Thin Film on Nanowire Array for High&#8208;Performance Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;quality MOF thin films with high orientation and controlled thickness are extremely desired for applications. However, they have been only successfully fabricated on flat substrates. Those MOF 2D thin films are limited by low exposed area and slow mass transport. To overcome these issues, MOF 3D thin films with good crystallinity, preferred orientation, and precisely controllable thickness in nanoscale were successfully prepared in a controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on nanowire array substrate for the first time. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;HHTP 3D thin film is superior to corresponding 2D thin films and showed one of the highest sensitivity, lowest LOD, and fastest response among all reported chemiresistive NH  3  sensing materials at RT. This work provides a feasible approach to grow preferred&#8208;oriented 3D MOF thin film, offering new perspectives for constructing MOF&#8208;based heterostructures for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones Bearing Two Vicinal Stereocenters Enabled by Synergistic Cu and Ir Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of a fundamentally new aldimine ester reaction model in which an azomethine ylide formed in situ serves as a two&#8208;atom dipole unit rather than the commonly used three&#8208;atom dipole unit, we present the first example of stereodivergent preparation of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones via synergistic Cu/Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade allylation/lactonization. By varying the combination of the chiral copper and chiral iridium catalysts, all four stereoisomers of &#947;&#8208;butyrolactones bearing two contiguous stereogenic centers are accessible with excellent diastereoselective and enantioselective control. The chiral Ir(III)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate was separated and further characterized to understand the origin of the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the initial C&#8208;C bond formation process. Control experiments shed some light on the catalyst/substrate and catalyst/catalyst interactions in this dual catalytic system to rationalize the related kinetic/dynamic kinetic resolution process with different catalyst combinations. The enantioenriched g&#8208;butyrolactone products were expediently converted into an array of structurally complex chiral molecules and organocatalysts that were otherwise inaccessible.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064 nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532 nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190 nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Clippane: a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) based on molecular tweezers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we report the preparation of a new mechanically interlocked molecule formed by the self&#8208;aggregation of two metallotweezers composed by two pyrene&#8208;imidazolylidene gold(I) arms and a pyridine&#8208;centered pentacyclic bis&#8208;alkynyl linker. The mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule arises from the presence of the bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups attached to the sides of the pyrene moieties of the arms of the tweezer, which act as stoppers avoiding the dissociation of the self&#8208;aggregated metallotweezer dimer once it is formed. By combining experimental techniques, such as NMR spectroscopy, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we were able to confirm the mechanically interlocked nature of this molecule in solution, in the gas phase and in the solid state. The behavior of the tert&#8208;butyl substituted tweezer differs greatly form that shown by the tweezer lacking of these bulky groups, whose dimeric structure is in equilibrium with the monomeric structure, therefore not showing any mechanical coercion that avoids the disassembly of the self&#8208;aggregated structure. We used the term Clippane, to refer to this new two&#8208;component MIMs formed by entangled molecular tweezers or clefts. Thus, clippanes add to catenantes, rotaxanes and molecular knots as new members of the family of MIMs.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly&#8208;curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of supramolecular complexes between fullerene C  60  and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by&#160;  1  H NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor fullerene C  60  . Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale shows that the addition of C  60  to&#160;  NG&#8208;1  solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460 nm lead to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of one&#8208;electron reduced form of C  60&#160;  in benzonitrile is observed.</dc:description>

Time-resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns-time scale shows that the addition of C  60  to&#160;  NG-1  solutions and photo-exciting them at 460 nm lead to the solvent-dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of one-electron reduced form of C  60&#160;  in benzonitrile is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circular permutated PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase as an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein biosensors play an increasingly important role as reporters for research and clinical applications. Here we present an approach for the construction of fully integrated but modular electrochemical biosensors based on the principal component of glucose monitors PQQ&#8208;glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ&#8208;GDH). We designed allosterically regulated circular permutated variants of PQQ&#8208;GDH that show large (&gt;10 fold) changes in enzymatic activity following intramolecular scaffolding of the newly generated N&#8208; and C termini by ligand binding domain:ligand complexes. The developed biosensors demonstrated sub&#8208;nanomolar affinities for small molecules and proteins in colorimetric and electrochemical assays.&#160; For instance, the concentration of Cyclosporine A could be measured in 1 ml of undiluted blood with the same accuracy as the leading diagnostic technique that uses 50 times more sample. We further used this biosensor to construct highly porous gold bioelectrodes capable of robustly detecting concentrations of Cyclosporine A as low as 20 pM and retained functionality in samples containing at least 60% human serum. These experiments suggest that the developed biosensor platform is generalizable and may be suitable for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care diagnostics</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Evolution of Selenium&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Modulated MoSe2 Precatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 was synthesized via a scalable salt&#8208;templated approach and investigated as a precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. MoSeS was identified as the actual electrocatalyst, which promoted conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S. When assembled into a battery, an impressive performance was observed, even with an elevated sulfur loading (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with a low electrolyte usage (4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S).







Abstract
Witnessing compositional evolution and identifying the catalytically active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li&#8211;S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive. We report the scalable salt&#8208;templated synthesis of Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;incorporated MoSe2 architecture (SeVs&#8208;MoSe2) and reveal the phase evolution of the defective precatalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs&#8208;MoSe2 to MoSeS. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. The Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; 4.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1S). This work elucidates the design strategies and catalytic mechanisms of efficient electrocatalysts bearing defects.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Mass Spectrometry Reveals Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell mass spectrometric method based on a dielectric barrier discharge ionization source was used to analyze multiple metabolites in different cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) at the single&#8208;cell level with a throughput of around 38 cells per minute.







Abstract
Even populations of clonal cells are heterogeneous, which requires high&#8208;throughput analysis methods with single&#8208;cell sensitivity. Here, we propose a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell analytical method based on active capillary dielectric barrier discharge ionization mass spectrometry, which can analyze multiple metabolites in single cells at a rate of 38 cells/minute. Multiple cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) were discriminated successfully. We found evidence for abnormal lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells. We also analyzed gene expression in a cancer genome atlas dataset and found that the mRNA level of a critical enzyme of lipid synthesis (ATP citrate lyase, ACLY) was upregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, both an ACLY chemical inhibitor and a siRNA approach targeting ACLY could suppress the viability of PDAC cells. A significant reduction in lipid content in treated cells indicates that ACLY could be a potential target for treating pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Photocatalytic Arylation of P4 and PH3: Reaction Development Through Mechanistic Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic studies provide significant, new insights into the mechanism of the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Through the first&#8208;time observation of a series of reaction intermediates, these studies have also inspired the development of the first examples of direct, catalytic arylation of PH3, which is a key synthetic intermediate for industrial phosphorus chemistry.







Abstract
Detailed 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopic investigations provide deeper insight into the complex, multi&#8208;step mechanisms involved in the recently reported photocatalytic arylation of white phosphorus (P4). Specifically, these studies have identified a number of previously unrecognized side products, which arise from an unexpected non&#8208;innocent behavior of the commonly employed terminal reductant Et3N. The different rate of formation of these products explains discrepancies in the performance of the two most effective catalysts, [Ir(dtbbpy)(ppy)2][PF6] (dtbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and 3DPAFIPN. Inspired by the observation of PH3 as a minor intermediate, we have developed the first catalytic procedure for the arylation of this key industrial compound. Similar to P4 arylation, this method affords valuable triarylphosphines or tetraarylphosphonium salts depending on the steric profile of the aryl substituents.

         <title>Immobilizing Redox&#8208;Active Tricycloquinazoline into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework Cu&#8208;HHTQ with multiple redox&#8208;active sites originated from a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and a CuO4 unit was designed for Li&#8208;ion batteries with high capacity, extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. TQ was identified as redox activity with Li+ for the first time.







Abstract
Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;The 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework Cu-HHTQ with multiple redox-active sites originated from a nitrogen-rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and a CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit was designed for Li-ion batteries with high capacity, extraordinary high-rate capability and impressive cyclability. TQ was identified as redox activity with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for the first time.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroaromatic-conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li-ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen-rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit into a two-dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu-HHTQ (HHTQ=2,3,7,8,12,13-hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 600&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with extraordinary high-rate capability and impressive cyclability.

         <title>Siloxy Esters as Traceless Activators of Carboxylic Acids: Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Aldol Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a chiral boron&#8208;catalyzed, carboxylic acid&#8208;selective asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates at late stages for the first time. Computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity through Si/B enediolates acting as the active species.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is among the most useful reactions in organic synthesis. Despite the existence of many prominent reports, however, the late&#8208;stage, chemoselective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction of multifunctional substrates is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we identified that in situ pre&#8208;conversion of carboxylic acids to siloxy esters facilitated the boron&#8208;catalyzed direct aldol reaction, leading to the development of carboxylic acid&#8208;selective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates. Combining experimental and computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism and led to the proposal of Si/B enediolates as the active species. The silyl ester formation facilitated both enolization and catalyst turnover by acidifying the &#945;&#8208;proton of substrates and attenuating poisonous Lewis bases to the boron catalyst.

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) were tailored for the inhibition of trypsin&#8208;induced cell injury and angiogenin&#8208;induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating their great potentials as therapeutic drugs for disease treatment.







Abstract
Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs that exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing the angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid Chelator that Can Remove Cu2+ from Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides and Stop the Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species Associated with Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;chelation from amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide complexes is a known approach towards the development of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Herein we describe a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that removes Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn, forming the thermodynamically stable Cu&#8211;chelator complex, and by this enables the inhibition of ROS production in a reducing environment at physiological pH.







Abstract
Cu bound to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides can act as a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuropathologic degradation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An excellent therapeutic approach is to use a chelator that can selectively remove Cu from Cu&#8211;A&#946;. This chelator should compete with Zn2+ ions (Zn) that are present in the synaptic cleft while forming a nontoxic Cu complex. Herein we describe P3, a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that selectively removes Cu2+ from Cu&#8211;A&#946; in the presence of Zn and prevent the formation of ROS even in a reductive environment. We demonstrate, based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, that although P3 extracts Zn from Cu,Zn&#8211;A&#946; faster than it removes Cu, the formed Zn complexes are kinetic products that further dissociate, while CuP3 is formed as an exclusive stable thermodynamic product. Our unique findings, combined with the bioavailability of peptoids, make P3 an excellent drug candidate in the context of AD.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bound Dense Micelle Brush Supports for Continuous Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forest&#8208;like micellar brushes fabricated under an ambient environment in glass capillaries enable flexible decoration of various nanocatalysts and subsequently permit a broad range of continuous flow transformations. Notably, this strategy is feasible for short and long capillaries, allowing the preparation of flow reactors with significantly higher throughput.







Abstract
Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in&#8197;situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions, and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.

         <title>A Semi&#8208;artificial Photoelectrochemical Tandem Leaf with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Efficiency Approaching 1&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formate dehydrogenase was interfaced with a perovskite to produce a photocathode that benefits from an optimized local enzyme environment via the electrolyte solution and achieves an unprecedented current density. Combination with a BiVO4 water oxidation photoanode gave a bias&#8208;free biophotoelectrochemical tandem leaf with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photoelectrochemistry can combine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaic light&#8208;absorbers with enzymes evolved for selective fuel&#8208;forming reactions such as CO2 reduction, but the overall performance of such hybrid systems has been limited to date. Here, the electrolyte constituents were first tuned to establish an optimal local environment for a W&#8208;formate dehydrogenase to perform electrocatalysis. The CO2 reductase was then interfaced with a triple cation lead mixed&#8208;halide perovskite through a hierarchically structured porous TiO2 scaffold to produce an integrated photocathode achieving a photocurrent density of &#8722;5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode during simulated solar light irradiation. Finally, the combination with a water&#8208;oxidizing BiVO4 photoanode produced a bias&#8208;free integrated biophotoelectrochemical tandem device (semi&#8208;artificial leaf) with a solar CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate energy conversion efficiency of 0.8&#8201;%.

         <title>Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronic Isolation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an electronic isolation strategy to produce persistent and stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling of a meta&#8208;substituted monomer. The polymer exhibited chemical robustness, localized radical feature, high spin density, and broad yet strong absorption. The radical polymer applied in photothermal conversion yielded unprecedented performance of record&#8208;high temperature of 268&#8201;&#176;C and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronic isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta&#8208;position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevents them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow band gap of 0.68&#8197;eV, strong yet extended UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption up to 1800&#8197;nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record&#8208;high photothermal temperature increment of &#8776;&#8764;240&#8201;&#176;C and striking solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of electronic isolation of radicals for producing outstanding photothermal materials.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cochlearol&#8197;B via Intramolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B is reported. Utilization of Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction, oxidative cyclization and intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, resulted in the completion of the total synthesis with 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses of synthesized intermediate and cochlearol&#8197;B clearly confirmed the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of cochlearol&#8197;B, a meroterpenoid natural product featuring a 4/5/6/6/6&#8208;fused pentacyclic structure. Key steps, oxidative cyclization and subsequent intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which constructed the pentacyclic structure in highly stereoselective manner, allowed efficient access to cochlearol&#8197;B with the longest linear sequence of 16 steps, and in 9&#8201;% overall yield. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly confirmed the stereochemistry of cochlearol&#8197;B.

         <title>Tuneable Time Delay in the Burst Release from Oxidation&#8208;Sensitive Polymersomes Made by PISA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes made by PISA based on thioether&#8208;functionalized polymers as membrane&#8208;forming block show a spontaneous membrane destabilization once a critical degree of oxidation is reached. Fine&#8208;tuning of the degradation time can be performed either by adjusting the membrane thickness or by partial pre&#8208;oxidation and can be further exploited to tailor the burst release of encapsulated dyes or enzymes in the presence of specific triggers.







Abstract
Reactive polymersomes represent a versatile artificial cargo carrier system that can facilitate an immediate release in response to a specific stimulus. The herein presented oxidation&#8208;sensitive polymersomes feature a time&#8208;delayed release mechanism in an oxidative environment, which can be precisely adjusted by either tuning the membrane thickness or partial pre&#8208;oxidation. These polymeric vesicles are conveniently prepared by PISA allowing the straightforward and effective in situ encapsulation of cargo molecules, as shown for dyes and enzymes. Kinetic studies revealed a critical degree of oxidation causing the destabilization of the membrane, while no release of the cargo is observed beforehand. The encapsulation of glucose oxidase directly transforms these polymersomes into glucose&#8208;sensitive vesicles, as small molecules including sugars can passively penetrate their membrane. Considering the ease of preparation, these polymersomes represent a versatile platform for the confinement and burst release of cargo molecules after a precisely adjustable time span in the presence of specific triggers, such as H2O2 or glucose.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Grown Chloride Perovskite Crystal of Red Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs2NaxAg1&#8722;xInCl6:y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180&#8201;&#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na+ and Mn2+, the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (ca. 100&#8201;%) and a long duration time (&gt;5400&#8197;s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals.

The energy transfer (ET) process between self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41&#8201;%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na+, was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps. Cryogenic afterglow measurements suggested that the afterglow phenomenon was likely governed by thermal&#8208;activated exciton diffusion and electron tunneling process.

         <title>Enantioselective Gel Phase Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of MOMs in gels: Gel phase synthesis of metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) resulted in homochiral MOMs, which were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The chirality of the gelator dictated the handedness of the MOMs and the enantioselectivity was confirmed by solid&#8208;state circular dichroism experiments.







Abstract
We report the asymmetric synthesis of homochiral metal&#8211;organic materials (MOMs) in chiral gels from achiral components. The enantioselectivity of MOMs depends on the chirality of the gel, whereas the synthesis performed in solution phase and achiral gels resulted in conglomerates.

         <title>Optimized synthesis of solution&#8208;processable crystalline poly(triazine imide) with minimized defects for OLED application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline semiconducting carbon nitrides are chemically and physically resilient, consist of earth abundant elements, and can be exfoliated into 2D atomically thin layers. In particular, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) is a highly crystalline semiconductor, and though no techniques exist to date that enable synthesis of macroscopic monolayers of PTI, it is possible to study it in thin layer device applications that are compatible with its polycrystalline, nanoscale morphology. In our study, we find that the by&#8208;product of conventional PTI synthesis is a C&#8208;C carbon rich phase that is detrimental for charge transport and photoluminescence. An optimised synthetic protocol yields a PTI material with an increased quantum yield, enabled photocurrent and electroluminescence. In addition, we report that protonation of the PTI structure happens preferentially at the pyridinic nitrogen atoms of the triazine (C  3  N  3  ) rings, is accompanied by exfoliation of PTI layers, and contributes to increases in quantum yield and exciton lifetimes. This study describes structure&#8208;property relationships in PTI that link (i) the nature of defects, their formation, and how to avoid them with (ii) the optical and electronic performance of PTI. On the basis of our findings, we create an OLED prototype with PTI as the active, metal&#8208;free material, and we lay the foundations for device integration of solution&#8208;processable graphitic carbon nitride dispersions in semiconductor devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor/&#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation for Constructing a Stable NIR&#8208;II Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen with Balanced Photo&#8208;theranostic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taking advantages of the versatile functionality and tunable energy dissipation, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) emerge as a rising star to afford multimodal theranostics platform. Nevertheless, the construction of AIE&#8208;active phototheranostic agent in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8722;1700 nm) which allows superior resolution and minimized photodamage is still a formidably challenging suffering from the limited candidate of building blocks. Herein, benzo[c]thiophene is innovatively utilized as electron&#8208;rich and bulky donor (D)/&#960;&#8208;bridge which can enlarge the conjugation length and distort the backbone. By precise D/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering, highly stable NIR&#8208;II AIEgen DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ NPs with acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence quantum yield and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 40.6% under 808 nm laser irradiation are successfully obtained. In addition, the exactly spatial conformation of DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ is determined for the first time by associating X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction and theoretical simulations, elaborately revealing the relationship between structure and AIE effect/photothermal performance. Extensive  in vitro  tests demonstrate that DPBTA&#8208;DPTQ NPs with good biocompatibility show efficient photothermal therapeutic effects. Furthermore, their prominent performance on fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal eradication of tumor is verified in HepG2 and B16&#8208;F10 tumor&#8208;xenografted mice, demonstrating distinguished cancer theranostic capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins through the synthesis of a diverse, sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesterol transport proteins regulate a vast array of cellular processes including lipid metabolism, vesicular and nonvesicular trafficking, organelle contact sites, and autophagy. Despite their undoubted importance, the identification of selective modulators of this class of proteins has been challenging due to the structural similarities in the cholesterol&#8208;binding site. Herein we report a general strategy for the identification of selective inhibitors of cholesterol transport proteins  via  the synthesis of a diverse sterol&#8208;inspired compound collection. Fusion of a primary sterol fragment to an array of secondary privileged scaffolds led to the identification of potent and selective inhibitors of the cholesterol transport protein Aster&#8208;C, which displayed a surprising preference for the unnatural sterol AB&#8208;ring stereochemistry, and new inhibitors of Aster&#8208;A. We propose that this strategy can, and should be applied to any therapeutically relevant sterol&#8208;binding protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering lattice oxygen activation of iridium clusters stabilized on amorphous bimetal borides array for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ  18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Short&#8208;Wavelength Phase&#8208;Matching Second Harmonic Generation in Boron&#8208;Rich Borosulfate with Planar [BO3] Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals which can produce short&#8208;wavelength lasers via a direct second harmonic generation (SHG) process are of great importance in modern laser technology. Currently, the exploration of UV NLO crystals in borosulfates is nearly stagnant since the non&#8208;phase matching (PM) property lies on the small birefringence induced by the intrinsically small optical anisotropy of the tetrahedral groups. Herein, for the first time, the planar [BO3] units were introduced into borosulfates leading to a boron&#8208;rich borosulfate (NH4)2B4SO10 with unprecedented [B4SO10]&#8734; layers and evidently enhanced birefringence. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the shortest SHG PM wavelength of 252 nm in all reported borosulfates with deep UV cutoff edge (184 nm), large SHG response (1.1 &#215; KDP at 1064 nm and 0.15 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO at 532 nm) and large birefringence (0.056 at 1064 nm) and is easy to grow single crystals via simple chemical vapor deposition method. These results confirm the feasibility of utilizing planar [BO3] units to optimize&#160;birefringence of borosulfates, and also open up broad prospects for UV NLO crystals in boron&#8208;rich borosulfates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Molecular Basis of the Catalytic Mechanism of Geranyl Pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 Methyltransferase: Creation of an Unprecedented Farnesyl Pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prenyl pyrophosphate methyltransferases enhance the structural diversity of terpenoids. However, the molecular basis of their catalytic mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, using multiple strategies, we characterized a geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) C&#8208;6&#8208;methyltransferase, BezA. Biochemical analysis revealed that BezA requires Mg  2+  and solely methylates GPP. The crystal structures of BezA and its complex with  S  &#8208;adenosyl homocysteine were solved at 2.10 &#197; and 3.00 &#197;, respectively. Further analyses using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations revealed the molecular basis of the methylation reaction. Importantly, the function of E170 as a catalytic base to complete the methylation reaction was established. We also succeeded in switching the substrate specificity by introducing a W210A substitution, resulting in an unprecedented farnesyl pyrophosphate C&#8208;6 methyltransferase.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Reactivity Relationship for Nano&#8208;Catalysts in the Hydrogenation/Dehydrogenation Controlled Reaction Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast yet accurate prediction for the activity of a nanostructured catalyst is an essential but challenging task in heterogeneous catalysis. Despite some successful attempts on describing energetic parameters in different adsorption environments, a general solution to building direct structure&#8208;reactivity relationship quantitatively has not yet been established. On the basis of the first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we developed a kinetic model to build the adsorption site dependence of the activity for reaction systems which are controlled by the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation processes. We applied this kinetic model to investigate the size&#8208; and shape&#8208;effects of Cu nano&#8208;catalysts in the water&#8208;gas shift reaction. By accumulating the activities of different adsorption sites, our model satisfactorily reproduced the experimental apparent activation energies for nano&#8208;catalyst with size over hundreds of nanometers, which were out of reach for conventional first&#8208;principle&#8208;based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Our results disclose that, even for a cubic nano&#8208;catalyst with size of 877 nm, its activity can still be closely related to the activity of edge sites, instead of only the exposed Cu(100) facets as might have been expected. The present model is expected to enhance the kinetic investigations of various chemical systems of interest, especially in chemical systems that are important in hydrogen economics.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot green process to synthesize MXene with controllable surface terminations using molten salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface terminations&#160;of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti  3  C  2  T  x  ) considerably impact its physicochemical properties.&#160;Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8211;F surface&#160;terminations or metallic impurities in MXene.&#160;We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to&#160;synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  . Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus,&#160;&#160;no metallics are present in the Ti  3  C  2  Cl  2  product. The&#160;surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8211;Cl to &#8211;O and/or &#8211;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the the variety of surface terminations.&#160;The obtained &#8211;O&#8208;terminated Ti  3  C  2  T  x  are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225 F g  &#8208;1  at 1.0 A g  &#8208;1  , good rate performance (91.1% at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ) and excellent capacitance retention (100 % after 10000 charging&#8208;discharging cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), which is superior to multi&#8208;layered Ti  3  C  2  T  x  prepared by other etching methods.</dc:description>

         <title>La3Ga3Ge2S3O10: An&#160;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxysulfide Designed by Anion&#8208;Directed Band Gap Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide&#8208;containing compounds have been widely studied as infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, they have never been applied in the ultraviolet (UV) region owing to the high energy levels of chalcogen anions, leading to band gap narrowing. In this paper, we report the synthesis of a new UV NLO oxysulfide La  3  Ga  3  Ge  2  S  3  O  10  with an exceptionally wide band gap of 4.70 eV due to from the unique anion&#8208;ordered frameworks comprising 1D  1  &#165;  [(Ga  3/5  Ge  2/5  )  3  S  3  O  3  ] triangular tubes and 0D (Ga  3/5  Ge  2/5  )  2  O  7  dimers of corner&#8208;sharing (Ga/Ge)S  2  O  2  and (Ga/Ge)O  4  tetrahedra, respectively. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements revealed that La  3  Ga  3  Ge  2  S  3  O  10  was phase matchable with twice the SHG response of KH  2  PO  4  . The results of theoretical calculations suggest that the strong SHG response is mainly attributable to the S&#8208;3  p  and O&#8208;2  p  orbitals in the occupied states. The anion&#8208;directed band&#8208;gap engineering may give insights into the application of NLO oxychalcogenides in the UV regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Kinetic Resolution and Asymmetric Induction within a Borrowing Hydrogen Cascade Mediated by a Single Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanistic uniqueness and versatility of borrowing hydrogen catalysis provides an opportunity to investigate the controllability of a cascade reaction, and more importantly, to realize either one or both of chiral recognition and chiral induction simultaneously. Here we report that, in a borrowing hydrogen cascade starting from racemic allylic alcohols, one of the enantiomers could be kinetically resolved, while the other enantiomer could be purposely converted to various targeted products, including &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones and &#947;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. By employing a robust Ru&#8208;catalyst, both kinetic resolution and asymmetric induction were achieved with remarkable levels of efficiency and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that corresponding catalyst&#8208;substrate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are pivotal to realize the observed stereochemical diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA tiling enables precise acylation&#8208;based labeling and control of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for site&#8208;selective labeling of long, native RNAs are needed for studying mRNA biology and future therapies. Current approaches involve engineering RNA sequences, which may alter folding, or are limited to specific sequences or bases. Here, we describe a versatile strategy for mRNA conjugation via a novel DNA tiling approach. The method, TRAIL, exploits a pool of &#8220;protector&#8221; oligodeoxynucleotides to hybridize and block the mRNA, combined with an &#8220;inducer&#8221; DNA that extrudes a reactive RNA loop for acylation at a predetermined site. Using TRAIL, an azido&#8208;acylimidazole reagent was employed for labeling and controlling RNA for multiple applications  in vitro  and in cells, including analysis of RNA&#8208;binding proteins, imaging mRNA in cells, and analysis and control of translation. The TRAIL approach offers an efficient and accessible way to label and manipulate RNAs of virtually any length or origin without altering native sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Simultaneous Imaging of Acidification and Proteolysis in Single Phagosomes Using Bifunctional Janus Particle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The digestion of pathogens inside phagosomes by immune cells occurs through a sequence of reactions including acidification and proteolysis, but how the reactions are orchestrated in the right order is unclear due to a lack of methods to simultaneously measure more than one reaction in phagosomes. Here we report a bifunctional Janus particle probe to simultaneously monitor acidification and proteolysis in single phagosomes in live cells. Each probe consists of a pH reporter and a proteolysis reporter that are spatially separated but function concurrently. Using the Janus probes, we found the acidic pH needed to initiate and maintain proteolysis, revealing the mechanism for the sequential occurrence of both reactions during pathogen digestion. We showed how bacterium&#8208;derived lipopolysaccharide alters the acidification and proteolysis in phagosomes. This study showcases the Janus particle probes as a generally applicable tool for monitoring multiple reactions in intracellular vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Ratiometric Nanothermometry Regulated by Tailoring Annihilators of Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanomicelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion is a special non&#8208;linear photophysical process that converts low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons based on sensitizer/annihilator pairs. This unique ability of TTA upconversion is especially useful for bio&#8208;applications because the longer&#8208;wavelength light source not only has a larger penetration depth that offers a longer working distance but also is distinguished from the intrinsic auto&#8208;fluorescence that reduces background interference. Moreover, adding stimuli&#8208;responsiveness to TTA upconversion will provide a unique platform for chemosensing and biosensing. Here, we successfully constructed a novel luminescence ratiometric nanothermometer based on TTA upconversion nanomicelles by encapsulating sensitizer/annihilator molecules into a temperature&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic triblock polymer. These TTA upconversion nanomicelles exhibited good linear relationships between the luminescence ratio (integrated intensity ratio of upconverted luminescence peak to the downshifted phosphorescence peak) and the temperature. These TTA upconversion nanomicelles demonstrated excellent thermal sensitivitiy up to 32.56%&#176;C&#8208;1 with outstanding air&#8208;tolerance, and reliability, and reproducibility. Furthermore, we found modifying the annihilators&#8217; chemical structure via introducing hydroxymethyl groups would rule out the interference of the polymer concentration on the thermal sensitivity and stereochemical engineering of annihilators would readily regulate the thermal sensitivity. These upconversion nanomicelles were also successfully applied for thermal imaging of fluids with thermal gradient and in&#8208;situ monitoring of heat dissipation. This work provided a new strategy for designing and modifying TTA upconversion nanomicelles with a higher thermal sensitivity and less interference as ratiometric luminescence nanothermometers for broad potential applications, such as biological thermal imaging, nanomedicine, and micro/nano&#8208;fluidics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacidity of Non&#8208;Planar Boranes: C&#8208;H Bond Activation and Non&#8208;Classical Binding Modes at Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of a geometrically constrained boron Lewis superacid featuring exceptional structure and reactivity is disclosed. It allowed the formation of non&#8208;classical electron deficient B&#8208;H&#8208;B type of bonding which was supported by spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray diffraction parameters as well as computational studies. Taming the pyramidal Lewis acid electrophilicity through weak coordinating anion dissociation enabled a series of highly challenging chemical transformations such as Csp  2  &#8208;H and Csp  3  &#8208;H activation under frustrated Lewis pair regime and the cleavage of Csp  3  &#8208;Si bonds. The demonstration of such type of rich chemical behavior and flexibility on a single molecular compound make it a unique mediator of chemical transformations generally restricted to transition metals.</dc:description>
