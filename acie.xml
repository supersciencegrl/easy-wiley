         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Functionalized Nanowires to Construct Nanoelectrodes for Intracellular Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoelectrochemistry is widely recognized as a powerful tool for in situ studying processes at nanoscale. However, the exiting strategies for nanoelectrodes preparation usually suffer from limited variety of electrode materials, time&#8208;consuming fabrication procedures and difficulties in functionalization. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8208;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8208;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8208;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells. This work provides a brand new idea for facile construction of high&#8208;performance functionalized nanoelectrodes, which is of great benefit for the research on nanoscale processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Binding Initiated Activation of O&#8722;H Bonds on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Surface for Catalytic Oxidation of Biomass Hydroxyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen binding of molecules on specific solid surface is an attractive interaction that can be employed as driving force for chemical bond activation, material directed assembly, protein protection, etc. However, the lack of quantitative characterization method for hydrogen bonds (HBs) on surface seriously limits its application. Herein, we measured the standard Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G  0  ) of surface HBs using NMR technique. HBs accepting ability of surface was investigated in term of comparing &#916;G  0  values by employing model biomass platform 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural on a series of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8208;n catalysts with electron&#8208;rich doped&#8208;nitrogen contents adjusted. Reducing the &#916;G  0  effectively improves HBs accepting ability of the nitrogen&#8208;doped surface, and promotes the O&#8722;H bonds selectively initiated activation in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. As a result, the reaction kinetics is accelerated and the rate constant is significantly increased. In addition to excellent catalytic performance, the turnover frequency (TOF) value for this oxidation is extremely higher than the reported non&#8208;noble metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Enabled Organocatalyzed Controlled Alternating Terpolymerization of Perfluorinated Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerizations of perfluorinated vinyl ethers (PFVEs) provide an important category of fluoropolymers that have received considerable interests in applications. In this work, we report the development of an organocatalyzed controlled radical alternating terpolymerization of PFVEs and vinyl ethers (VEs) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method not only enables the synthesis of a broad scope of fluorinated terpolymers of low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity, facilitating tuning the chemical compositions by rationally choosing the type and/or ratio of comonomers, but also allows temporal control of chain&#8208;growth, as well as the preparation of a variety of novel fluorinated block copolymers. To showcase the versatility of this method, fluorinated alternating terpolymers have been synthesized and customized to simultaneously display a variety of desirable properties for solid polymer electrolyte design, creating new opportunities in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular basis for two stereoselective Diels&#8208;Alderases that produce decalin skeletons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyzing [4+2] cycloaddition&#160;have attracted increasing attention because of their key roles in natural product biosynthesis. Here, we solved the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of a pair of decalin synthases, Fsa2 and Phm7, that catalyze intramolecular [4+2] cycloadditions to form enantiomeric decalin scaffolds during biosynthesis of the HIV&#8208;1 integrase inhibitor equisetin and its stereochemical opposite, phomasetin. Computational modeling, using molecular dynamics simulations as well as quantum chemical calculations, demonstrates that the reactions proceed through synergetic conformational constraints assuring transition state&#8208;like substrates folds and their stabilization by specific protein&#8208;substrate interactions. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments verified the binding models. Intriguingly, the flexibility of bound substrates is largely different in two enzymes, suggesting the distinctive mechanism of dynamics regulation behind these stereoselective reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism herein deepens the basic understanding how these enzymes work but also provides a guiding principle to create artificial enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ implanting single tungsten site into defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by solvent&#8208;free route for efficient oxidative desulfurization at room temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of single site catalysts with catalytic sites at atomic&#8208;scale and high atom utilization, provides new opportunities to gain superior catalytic performance for targeted reactions. In this contribution, we report a one&#8208;pot green approach for in&#8208;situ implanting single tungsten site (up to 12.7 wt.%) onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66(Zr) structure via forming Zr&#8208;O&#8208;W bonds under solvent&#8208;free condition. The catalysts displayed extraordinary activity for the oxidative removal of sulfur compounds (1000 ppm S) at room temperature within 30 min. The turnover frequency (TOF) value can reach 44.0 h  &#8208;1  at 30&#176;C, which is 109.0, 12.3 and 1.2 times higher than that of pristine UiO&#8208;66(Zr), WO  3  , and WCl  6  (homogeneous catalyst). Theoretical and experimental studies show that the anchored W sites can react with oxidant readily and generate W(VI)&#8208;peroxo intermediates that determine the reaction activity. Our work not only manifests the application of SSCs in the field of desulfurization of fuel oil but also opens a new solvent&#8208;free avenue for fabricating MOFs based SSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Triple Vertex Linkage of (BO4)&#8208;Tetrahedra in a Borosulfate: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Quantum Chemical Investigation of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borosulfates are classified as silicate analogue materials. The number of crystallographically characterized compounds is still limited, whereas the structural diversity is already impressive. The anionic substructures of borosulfates exhibit vertex connected (BO  4  )&#8208; and (SO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra, whereas bridging between two (SO  4  )&#8208; or even between two (BO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra is scarce. The herein presented compound Sr[B  3  O(SO  4  )  4  (SO  4  H)] is the first borosulfate with a triple vertex linkage of three (BO  4  )&#8208;tetrahedra  via  one common oxygen atom. DFT calculations complement the experimental studies. Bader charges (calculated for all atoms) as well as charge density calculations give hint to the electron distribution within the anionic substructure and DOS calculations support the interpretation of the bonding situation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Decorated Amorphous/Crystalline RuO2 with Rich Oxygen Vacancies: A Robust pH&#8208;Universal Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction for many electrochemical devices. To date, many OER electrocatalysts function well in alkaline media, but exhibit poor performances in neutral and acidic media, especially the acidic stability. Herein, sodium&#8208;decorated amorphous/crystalline RuO  2  with rich oxygen vacancies (a/c&#8208;RuO  2  ) was developed as a pH&#8208;universal OER electrocatalyst. The a/c&#8208;RuO  2  shows remarkable resistance to acid corrosion and oxidation during OER, which leads to an extremely high catalytic stability, as confirmed by a negligible overpotential increase after continuously catalyzing OER for 60 h at pH = 1. Besides, a/c&#8208;RuO  2  also exhibits superior OER activities to commercial RuO  2  and most reported OER catalysts under all pH conditions. Theoretical calculations indicated that the introduction of Na dopant and oxygen vacancy in RuO  2  weakens the adsorption strength of the OER intermediates by engineering the  d  &#8208;band center, thereby lowering the energy barrier for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Mitochondrial MicroRNAs via Optically Programmable Strand Displacement Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNA (miRNA) functions are tightly regulated by their sub&#8208;compartmental location in living cells, and the ability to imaging of mitochondrial miRNAs (mitomiRs) is essential for understanding of the related pathological processes. However, most existing DNA&#8208;based methods could not be used for this purpose. Here, we report the development of a DNA nanoreporter technology for imaging of mitomiRs in living cells through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled DNA strand displacement reactions. The sensing function of the DNA nanoreporters are silent (OFF) during the delivery process, but can be photoactivated (ON) with NIR light after targeted mitochondrial localization, enabling spatially&#8208;restricted imaging of two types of cancer&#8208;related mitomiRs with improved detection accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate imaging of mitomiRs in vivo through spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled delivery and activation. Therefore, this study illustrates a simple methodology that may be broadly applicable for investigating the mitomiRs&#8208;associated physiological events.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Osteopontin Fragment Orders During Interfacial Calcium Oxalate Mineralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium oxalate (CaC  2  O  4  ) is the major component of kidney stone, a prevalent chronic human disease worldwide. The acidic osteopontin (OPN) protein in human urine can effectively inhibit the growth of CaC  2  O  4  crystals, thereby acting as a potent stone preventer. Previous studies in bulk solution all attest to the importance of binding and recognition of OPN at the CaC  2  O  4  mineral surface, yet molecular level insights into the active interface during CaC  2  O  4  mineralization are still lacking. Here, we probe the structure of the central OPN fragment and its interaction with Ca  2+  and CaC  2  O  4  at the water&#8208;air interface using surface&#8208;specific non&#8208;linear vibrational spectroscopy. While OPN peptides remain largely disordered in solution, our results reveal that the bidentate binding of Ca  2+  ions refold the interfacial peptides into well&#8208;ordered and assembled beta turn motifs. One critical intermediate directs mineralization by releasing structural freedom of backbone and binding side chains. These insights into the mineral interface are crucial for understanding the pathological development of kidney stones and possibly relevant for calcium oxalate biomineralization in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidimensional Characterization of Single&#8208;Molecule Dynamics in a Plasmonic Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;dimensional spectroscopic platform allows measurement of structural, mechanical, and electronic transport properties of a single molecule. By simultaneous measurement and correlating electrical and optical properties of a single&#8208;molecule junction, mutually agreeable evidence of dynamic behavior of single&#8208;molecule sensitivity is extracted. Strain&#8208;induced structural changes of an isolated individual molecule in situ can thus be observed.







Abstract
Nanoscale manipulation and characterization of individual molecules is necessary to understand the intricacies of molecular structure, which governs phenomena such as reaction mechanisms, catalysis, local effective temperatures, surface interactions, and charge transport. Here we utilize Raman enhancement between two nanostructured electrodes in combination with direct charge transport measurements to allow for simultaneous characterization of the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of a single molecule. This multi&#8208;dimensional information yields repeatable, self&#8208;consistent, verification of single&#8208;molecule resolution, and allows for detailed analysis of structural and configurational changes of the molecule in situ. These experimental results are supported by a machine&#8208;learning based statistical analysis of the spectral information and calculations to provide insight into the correlation between structural changes in a single&#8208;molecule and its charge&#8208;transport properties.

The development of selective chemosensors for glucose detection in biologically relevant solutions is a challenging task. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103545), Javier Ramos&#8208;Soriano, M.&#8197;Carmen Galan and co&#8208;workers show a vibration&#8208;induced emision&#8208;type receptor that operates in aqueous media and can detect glucose and discriminate between closely related monosaccharides including those commonly found in blood.&#160; Moreover, the recognition event can be monitored by the naked&#8208;eye in a ratiometric manner.

         <title>Non&#8208;Planar Perylene Bisimide Analogues with Inserted Carbonyl and Methylene Subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) analogues with an inserted carbonyl or methylene moiety are described. The carbonyl&#8208;inserted PBI derivative immediately underwent intersystem crossing in its excited state. The deprotonation of the methylene&#8208;inserted PBI derivative afforded the corresponding carbanion, which underwent redox&#8208;induced reversible C&#8722;C bond formation to provide the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimer almost quantitatively.







Abstract
The synthesis and properties of dinaphthotropone bisimide (DNTrBI) and dinaphthocycloheptatriene bisimide (DNCHepBI) are described. Their molecular design is conceptually based on the insertion of a carbon atom into a perylene bisimide (PBI) core. These molecules adopt non&#8208;planar structures due to the presence of a seven&#8208;membered ring. The PBI derivative into which a carbonyl group was inserted (DNTrBI) immediately underwent nonradiative decay and/or intersystem crossing in its excited state. The PBI derivative into which a methylene group was inserted (DNCHepBI) was susceptible to deprotonation on account of the two electron&#8208;withdrawing naphthalene monoimide units. Subsequent aerobic oxidation resulted in the formation of a C&#8722;C bond at the central methylene unit, thus affording a &#963;&#8208;dimer. The formation of this C&#8722;C bond is dynamically redox&#8208;active, i.e., electron injection into the &#963;&#8208;dimer almost quantitatively regenerated the deprotonated DNCHepBI.

Logic&#8208;gated biocomputing was achieved in physiological conditions within 30&#8197;minutes via a single input of one molecule.







Abstract
Tumor biomarker&#8208;based theranostics have achieved broad interest and success in recent years. However, single biomarker&#8208;based recognition can cause false&#8208;positive feedback, including the on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor phenomenon, in the absence of tumor&#8208;specific antigen. Multibiomarker&#8208;based recognition molecules often elicit nonspecific and undesired internalization when they bind to &#8220;bystander&#8221; cells. We report a universal DNA tetrahedral scaffold (DTS) that anchors on the cell membrane to load multiple aptamers and therapeutics for precise and effective theranostics. This DNA logic&#8208;gated nanorobot (DLGN) not only facilitates precise discrimination among five cell lines, but also triggers synergistic killing of effector aptamer&#8208;tethered synergistic drugs (EASDs) to target cancer cells. Logic&#8208;gated recognition integrated into aptamer&#8208;functionalized molecular machines will prompt fast tumor profiling, in&#8197;situ capture and isolation, and safe delivery of precise medicine.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Versatile Double&#8208;Allylation Reagent for Complex Diol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Make it a double: A strategy for the synthesis of novel double&#8208;allylation reagents based on the alkenylboration of alkenylboronates is presented. The ease and modularity with which the reagents can be prepared allows rapid access to a variety of complex diol motifs. In the context of these studies, we also demonstrate the first examples of the use of boronamides in allylation reactions.







Abstract
Double&#8208;allylation reagents allow for the construction of highly complex molecules in an expedient fashion. We have developed an efficient, modular, and enantioselective approach towards accessing novel variants of these reagents through Cu/Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkenylboration of alkenylboron derivatives. Importantly, we demonstrate novel use of an allylBdan reagent directly in a stereocontrolled allylation without initial deprotection to the boronic ester. These allylation products are employed in a second intermolecular allylation to access complex diol motifs, which has yet to be shown with these types of double&#8208;allylation reagents. Overall, the modularity of this approach and the ease in which complex structural motifs can be accessed in a rapid manner signify the importance and utility of this method.

         <title>Folded Perylene Diimide Loops as Mechanoresponsive Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two perylene diimides are combined to form a loop that acts as a supramolecular mechanophore. Mechanical deformation of polymers featuring this mechanophore triggers an instant, visually discernible, and reversible fluorescence color change that linearly correlates with the applied strain.







Abstract
A supramolecular mechanophore that can be integrated into polymers and indicates deformation by a fluorescence color change is reported. Two perylene diimides (PDIs) were connected by a short spacer and equipped with peripheral atom transfer polymerization initiators. In the idle state, the motif folds into a loop and its emission is excimer dominated. Poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) chains were grown from the motif and the mechanophore&#8208;containing polymer was blended with unmodified PMA to afford materials that display a visually discernible fluorescence color change upon deformation, which causes the loops to unfold. The response is instant, and correlates linearly with the applied strain. Experiments with a reference polymer containing only one PDI moiety show that looped mechanophores that display intramolecular excimer formation offer considerable advantages over intermolecular dye aggregates, including a concentration&#8208;independent response, direct signaling of mechanical processes, and a more pronounced optical change.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Archaeal Lipid Parallel GDGT&#8208;0 (Isocaldarchaeol)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, enantioselective synthesis of parallel GDGT&#8208;0 is reported using a global asymmetric hydrogenation to set all 16 methyl stereocenters. An unprecedented macrolactonization&#8208;hydrosilylation sequence then constructs the 72&#8208;membered macrocyclic lipid. Desymmetrization enabled the synthesis of a GDGT&#8208;0 with different headgroups. Phase transition and self&#8208;assembly studies gave evidence that the lipids form fluid giant unilamellar vesicles.







Abstract
Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples. Herein, we report a concise and stereoselective synthesis of the archaeal tetraether lipid parallel GDGT&#8208;0 and the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of derivatives bearing different polar groups.

         <title>Aziridine Formation by a FeII/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate Dependent Oxygenase and 2&#8208;Aminoisobutyrate Biosynthesis in Fungi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;step biosynthetic reaction from L&#8208;Val to 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid was reconstituted in vitro. The aziridine synthesis by non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxygenase TqaL, aziridine ring opening by haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and oxidative decarboxylation by NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM, were characterized. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis.







Abstract
Aziridine is a characteristically reactive molecule with increased bioactivity due to its strained ring structure. Here, we investigated the biosynthesis of 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) in Penicillium, and successfully reconstituted the three&#8208;step biosynthesis from L&#8208;Val to AIB in vitro. This previously unknown aziridine formation pathway proceeded with the non&#8208;heme iron and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent (FeII/&#945;KG) oxygenase TqaL, followed by aziridine ring opening by the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (HAD)&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation by the NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the C&#8722;N bond forming FeII/&#945;KG oxygenase TqaL was solved at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis, thereby expanding the catalytic repertoire of the FeII/&#945;KG oxygenases. We also report the unique aziridine ring opening by a HAD&#8208;type hydrolase and the remarkable oxidative decarboxylation by a non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase to produce AIB.

         <title>Heteroatom Cycloaddition at the (BN)2 Bay Region of Dibenzoperylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first acid&#8208;catalyzed heteroatom cycloaddition at the (BN)2 bay region of a dibenzoperylene with different aldehydes. This new method allows the synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the formation of 1,3,5,2,4&#8208;oxadiazadiborinan (B2N2CO) rings.







Abstract
Cycloaddition&#8208;dehydration involving a BNBN&#8208;butadiene analogue at the bay region of a dibenzoperylene and a non&#8208;enolizable aldehyde provides a novel strategy for incorporation of the oxadiazadiborinane (B2N2CO) ring into the scaffold of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon resulting in highly emissive compounds.

         <title>Genetic Encoding and Enzymatic Deprotection of a Latent Thiol Side Chain to Enable New Protein Bioconjugation Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic deprotection of a latent thiol under mild and physiological conditions expands the scope of classic thiol bioconjugation. New reaction schemes enable regioselective labeling and dual modifications for a variety of preparative applications and using the established and commercially available plethora of thiol&#8208;directed reagents.







Abstract
The thiol group of the cysteine side chain is arguably the most versatile chemical handle in proteins. To expand the scope of established and commercially available thiol bioconjugation reagents, we genetically encoded a second such functional moiety in form of a latent thiol group that can be unmasked under mild physiological conditions. Phenylacetamidomethyl (Phacm) protected homocysteine (HcP) was incorporated and its latent thiol group unmasked on purified proteins using penicillin G acylase (PGA). The enzymatic deprotection depends on steric accessibility, but can occur efficiently within minutes on exposed positions in flexible sequences. The freshly liberated thiol group does not require treatment with reducing agents. We demonstrate the potential of this approach for protein modification with conceptually new schemes for regioselective dual labeling, thiol bioconjugation in presence of a preserved disulfide bond and formation of a novel intramolecular thioether crosslink.

         <dc:description>Directed C&#8208;H functionalization has been realized as a

complimentary technique to achieve borylation at a distal position of

aliphatic amines. Here, we demonstrated the oxidative borylation at

the distal delta position of aliphatic amines using various borylating

of a cheap oxidant. Moreover, an organopalladium  &#948;  &#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8208;H

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer Synthesis by Merging Photoiniferter and Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to block copolymers from monomers that do not polymerize via a common mechanism requires initiation from a multifunctional species that allows orthogonal polymerization chemistries. We disclose a strategy to provide well&#8208;defined polyacrylamido&#8208;  b  &#8208;polyether block copolymers by a one&#8208;pot combination of photoiniferter polymerization and organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using a hydroxy&#8208;functionalized trithiocarbonate photoiniferter as the dual initiator at ambient temperature. Our results reveal good compatibility between the two polymerization systems and highlight that they can be performed in arbitrary order or simultaneously with good retention of the thiocarbonylthio functionality. We also demonstrate selective temporal control over the photoiniferter polymerization during concurrent ROP. We harnessed the efficiency of combining these polymerization systems to provide tailor&#8208;made block copolymers from chemically distinct monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Alkenylarylation of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Alkenyl Ketones via Carbonyl Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr  2  &#8226;DME as a catalyst and LiO  t  Bu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual surface texture, dimensions and morphology variations of chiral and single crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here a unique metallo&#8208;organic material where the appearance and the internal crystal structure are in contradiction. The egg&#8208;shaped (ovoid) crystals have a brain&#8208;like texture. Although these micro&#8208;sized crystals are monodispersed; like fingerprints their grainy surfaces are never exactly alike. Remarkably, our X&#8208;ray and electron diffraction studies unexpectedly revealed that these structures are single&#8208;crystals comprising a continuous coordination network of two differently shaped homochiral channels. By using the same building blocks under different reaction conditions, a rare series of crystals have been obtained that are uniquely rounded in their shape. In stark contrast to the brain&#8208;like crystals, these isostructural and monodispersed crystals have a comparatively smooth appearance. The sizes of these crystals vary by several orders of magnitude.</dc:description>

         <title>Shadow electrochemiluminescence microscopy of single mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are the subcellular bioenergetic organelles. The analysis of their morphology and topology is essential to provide useful information on their activity and metabolism. Herein, we report a label&#8208;free shadow electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy based on the spatial confinement of the ECL&#8208;emitting reactive layer to image single living mitochondria deposited on the electrode surface. The ECL mechanism of the freely&#8208;diffusing [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  dye with the sacrificial tri&#8208;  n  &#8208;propylamine&#160;coreactant restrains the light&#8208;emitting region to a micrometric thickness allowing to visualize individual mitochondria with a remarkable sharp negative optical contrast. The imaging approach named &#8220;shadow ECL&#8221; (SECL) reflects the negative imprint of the local diffusional hindrance of the ECL reagents by each mitochondrion. The statistical analysis of the colocalization of the shadow ECL spots with the functional mitochondria revealed by classical fluorescent biomarkers, MitoTracker Deep Red and the endogenous intramitochondrial NADH, validates the reported methodology. The versatility and extreme sensitivity of the approach are further demonstrated by visualizing single mitochondria, which remain hardly detectable with the usual biomarkers. Finally, by alleviating problems of photobleaching and phototoxicity associated with conventional microscopy methods, SECL microscopy should find promising applications in the imaging of subcellular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Heteroacenes that Contain Two Boron Atoms: Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Based on a Push&#8211;Pull Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;deficient heteroacenes that contain two tricoordinate boron atoms in their acene skeletons and planarized phenyl ether moieties at their periphery were synthesized via the borylation of silicon&#8208;bridged precursors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed quinoidal structures, which give rise to two&#8208;step&#160; reversible redox processes for both the reduction and oxidation . These compounds exhibit intense absorption and sharp fluorescence bands with vibronic structures in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. These properties originate from the push&#8211;pull effect along the long axis of the molecule derived from the electron&#8208;donating ether moiety and the electron&#8208;accepting boron moieties. Of particular note is the NIR emission of the thienothiophene&#8208;centered heteroacene, which has a maximum at 952 nm with a narrow band width of 309 cm  &#8211;1  &#160;in cyclohexane. A Franck&#8211;Condon analysis revealed the crucial role of the sterically less&#8208;hindered thienothiophene spacer in achieving this sharp emission band.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Microporous Nanorods Assembled by Polyoxometalate Clusters for the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microporous materials are extensively applied in catalysis owing to their unique pore structures. Among them, microporous materials loading polyoxometalates (POMs) exhibit considerable potential for catalysis thanks to the combination of the outstanding redox catalytic properties of POMs and the characteristics of microporous materials. Based on this, we developed a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize the helical microporous nanorods (HMNRs) using POM clusters as building blocks, combining the properties of both POMs and microporous materials while circumventing the complicated loading process. The HMNRs shows enhanced photocatalytic performance for toluene oxidation. Comparatively high activity, superior selectivity towards benzaldehyde, and prominent cycling stability were achieved, manifesting a promising prospect for the future application in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Alleged Structure of Crenarchaeol enables Structure Revision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crenarchaeol is a glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether lipid produced exclusively in Archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota. This membrane&#8208;spanning lipid is undoubtedly the structurally most sophisticated of all known archaeal lipids and an iconic molecule in organic geochemistry. The 66&#8208;membered macrocycle possesses a unique chemical structure featuring 22 mostly remote stereocenters, and a cyclohexane ring connected by a single bond to a cyclopentane ring. Herein we report the first total synthesis of the proposed structure of crenarchaeol. Comparison with natural crenarchaeol allowed us to propose a revised structure of crenarchaeol, wherein one of the 22 stereocenters is inverted.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid droplet formation and facile cytosolic translocation of IgG in the presence of attenuated cationic amphiphilic lytic peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated cationic amphiphilic lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) delivery into cells. Particle&#8208;like liquid droplets were generated by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with the cellular membrane led to spontaneous influx and distribution of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells in serum containing medium. Involvement of cellular machinery accompanied by actin polymerization and membrane ruffling was suggested for the translocation. Alexa488&#8208;IgG negative charges were crucial in liquid droplet formation with positively charged FcB(L17E)3. Binding of IgG to FcB(L17E)3 may not be necessary. Successful intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 594&#8208;labeled anti&#8208;nuclear pore complex antibody and anti&#8208;mCherry&#8208;nanobody tagged with supernegatively charged green fluorescence protein allowed binding to cellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability and optical absorption of a comprehensive virtual library of minimal eumelanin oligomer models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eumelanin is responsible for photoprotection in living organisms. It is made of 5,6&#8208;dihydroxyindole (DHI) oligomers. However, lack of detailed structural knowledge limits understanding its function and exploiting its potential in material science. To uncover the relationship between structural stability and optical properties, we have studied a virtual library of 830 DHI dimers. We find a preference for oxidized, polycyclic structures which speaks in favor of graphite&#8208;like structures for the larger oligomers, and propose an electrocyclic formation mechanism. Besides widely considered quinone oxidation patterns, also structures with interfragment double bonds and zwitterionic resonance structures are stable. Future theoretical melanine models will have to cover this diversity, and we introduce a new representative set of 49 stable dimers. Some stable oxidized dimers have absorption energies as low as 1.3 eV. They may be present as substructures in the naturally found oligomers and contribute to the absorption spectrum of the biopolymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Chemically Stable Aza&#8208;Bridged Bis(phenanthroline) Macrocycle&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new linkage&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is one of the major topics in reticular chemistry. Electrically conductive COFs have enabled applications in energy storage and electrochemical catalysis, which are not feasible using insulating COFs. Despite significant advances, the construction of chemically stable conductive COFs by the formation of new linkages remains relatively unexplored and challenging. Here we report the solvent&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) aza&#8208;bridged bis(phenanthroline) macrocycle&#8208;linked COF (ABBPM&#8208;COF) from the thermally induced poly&#8208;condensation of a tri&#8208;topic monomer and ammonia gas. The ABBPM&#8208;COF structure was elucidated using multiple techniques, including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of this COF combined with structural simulation, revealing its crystalline nature with an ABC stacking mode. Further experiments demonstrated its excellent chemical stability in acid/base solutions. Electrical conductivity measurements showed that insulating ABBPM&#8208;COF became a semiconducting material after exposure to iodine vapor.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complete cleavage of the triple bond of N  2  by fluoroborylene (:BF) was achieved in a low&#8208;temperature N  2  matrix by the formation of the four&#8208;membered heterocycle FB(  m  &#8208;N)  2  BF, which lacks a  trans  &#8208;annular N&#8208;N bond. In addition the linear complex FB=N&#8208;N=BF and cyclic FB(  h  2  &#8208;N  2  ) were formed. These novel species were characterized by their matrix&#8208;infrared spectra and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The puckered four&#8208;membered ring B  2  N  2  complex shows a delocalized aromatic 2&#8208;electron p system in conjugation with the  exo  &#8208;cyclic fluorine &#960; lone pairs.

         <title>Remote Site&#8208;selective Radical C(sp3)&#8208;H Monodeuteration of Amides using D2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into biologically active compounds is of high interest in pharmaceutical industry. We present a mild and environmentally benign metal&#8208;free method for the remote selective radical C&#8722;H monodeuteration of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in various amides with inexpensive heavy water (D2O) as the deuterium source. The method uses the easily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonyl moiety as N&#8208;radical precursor that generates the remote C&#8208;radical via site&#8208;selective 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Methyl thioglycolate, that readily exchanges its proton with D2O, serves as the radical deuteration reagent and as a chain&#8208;carrier. The highly site&#8208;selective monodeuteration has been applied to different types of unactivated  sp3&#8208;C&#8211;H bonds and also to the deuteration of C&#8211;H bonds next to heteroatoms. The potential utility of this method is further demonstrated by the site&#8208;selective incorporation of deuterium into natural product derivatives and drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>A dynamic chemical clip in supramolecular framework for sorting alkylaromatic isomers using thermodynamic and kinetic preferences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive chemical separation is at the forefront of future technologies, to be used in chemical and petrochemical industries. In this process, a porous adsorbent selectively allows a single component from a mixture of three or more chemical components to be adsorbed or permeate. To separate the unsorted chemicals, a different adsorbent is needed. A unique adsorbent which can recognize and separate each of the chemicals from a mixture of three or more components is the necessity for the next generation porous materials. In this regard, we demonstrate a &#8220;dynamic chemical clip&#8221; in a supramolecular framework capable of thermodynamic and kinetics&#8208;based chemical separation. The dynamic space, featuring strong preference for aromatic guests through &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and adaptability, can recognize the individual chemical isomers from mixtures and separate those based on thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The liquid&#8208;phase selectivity and separation of the aromatic isomers are possible by the adaptability of the &#8220;chemical clip&#8221; and here we elucidate the prime factors in a combinatorial approach involving crystallographic evidence and detail computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Based Hydrogen Sulfide Nanomotors Induce Multiple Acidosis in Tumor Cells by Destroying Tumor Metabolic Symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the chemical reaction in a tumor environment, L&#8208;cysteine can be catalyzed by cystathionine &#946;&#8208;synthase in tumor microenvironment to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and L&#8208;serine, to construct H2S&#8208;driven nanomotor. The nanomotors can move in tumor microenvironment, destroy tumor metabolic symbiosis and inhibit tumor growth specifically.







Abstract
Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H2S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.

         <title>Limonin as a Starting Point for the Construction of Compounds with High Scaffold Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many compound collections used in high&#8208;throughput screening are composed of members whose structural complexity is considerably lower than that of natural products. Here the natural product limonin was leveraged to generate 98 architecturally complex compounds with significant scaffold diversity. Phenotypic screening of the collection led to the discovery of novel anticancer compounds.







Abstract
Structurally complex natural products have been a fruitful source for the discovery and development of new drugs. In an effort to construct a compound collection populated by architecturally complex members with unique scaffolds, we have used the natural product limonin as a starting point. Limonin is an abundant triterpenoid natural product and, through alteration of its heptacyclic core ring system using short synthetic sequences, a collection of 98 compounds was created, including multiple members with novel ring systems. The reactions leveraged in the construction of these compounds include novel ring cleavage, rearrangements, and cyclizations, and this work is highlighted by the discovery of a novel B&#8208;ring cleavage reaction, a unique B/C&#8208;ring rearrangement, an atypical D&#8208;ring cyclization, among others. Computational analysis shows that 52 different scaffolds/ring systems were produced during the course of this work, of which 36 are unprecedented. Phenotypic screening and structure&#8211;activity relationships identified compounds with activity against a panel of cancer cell lines.

         <title>A Vibration&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Based Fluorescent Chemosensor for the Selective and Visual Recognition of Glucose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sugar fluorescent chemosensor which combines a vibrational&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (VIE)&#8208;active DPAC core and two N&#8208;methylaminomethylphenylboronic acid moieties can detect glucose within seconds and discriminate between closely related monosaccharides including those commonly found in blood.







Abstract
The development of chemosensors to detect analytes in biologically relevant solutions is a challenging task. We report the synthesis of a fluorescent receptor that combines vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) and dynamic covalent chemistry for the detection of glucose in aqueous media. We show that the bis&#8208;2&#8208;(N&#8208;methylaminomethyl)phenylboronic acid&#8208;decorated N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC) receptor 1 can detect glucose and discriminate between closely related monosaccharides including those commonly found in blood. Preliminary studies suggest monosaccharides bind to the DPAC&#8208;receptor with a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce pseudomacrocyclic complexes, which in turn leads to distinct optical changes in the fluorescent emission of the receptor for each host. Moreover, the complexation&#8208;induced change in emission can be detected visually and quantified in a ratiometric way. Our results highlight the potential of VIE&#8208;type receptors for the quantitative determination of saccharides in biological samples.

         <title>SO2 Capture Using Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic cages (POCs) were investigated for the first time for the capture of SO2. A tertiary amine cage (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated remarkably high SO2 capture that was perfectly reversible for at least 50 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles.







Abstract
We report the first experimental investigation of porous organic cages (POCs) for the demanding challenge of SO2 capture. Three structurally related N&#8208;containing cage molecular materials were studied. An imine&#8208;functionalized POC (CC3) showed modest and reversible SO2 capture, while a secondary&#8208;amine POC (RCC3) exhibited high but irreversible SO2 capture. A tertiary amine POC (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated very high SO2 capture (13.78&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1; 16.4&#8201;SO2 molecules per cage) combined with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles. The adsorption behavior was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy, 13C&#8197;CP&#8208;MAS NMR experiments, and computational calculations.

         <title>Quantitative and Multiplexed Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Intercellular Tensile Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence lifetime imaging&#8208;based cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA hairpin probe is designed to measure tensile forces at cell&#8211;cell junctions. The tension among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be quantified simultaneously during cellular processes such as the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition.







Abstract
Mechanical interactions between cells have been shown to play critical roles in regulating cell signaling and communications. However, the precise measurement of intercellular forces is still quite challenging, especially considering the complex environment at cell&#8211;cell junctions. In this study, we report a fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based approach to image and quantify intercellular molecular tensions. Using this method, tensile forces among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be measured simultaneously. We first validated our approach and developed lifetime measurement&#8208;based DNA tension probes to image E&#8208;cadherin&#8208;mediated tension on epithelial cells. These probes were then further applied to quantify the correlations between E&#8208;cadherin and N&#8208;cadherin tensions during an epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition process. The modular design of these probes can potentially be used to study the mechanical features of various physiological and pathological processes.

&lt;p&gt;A fluorescence lifetime imaging-based cell membrane-anchored DNA hairpin probe is designed to measure tensile forces at cell&#8211;cell junctions. The tension among multiple ligand&#8211;receptor pairs can be quantified simultaneously during cellular processes such as the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition.

         <title>Segmented Flow Processes to Overcome Hurdles of Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalysis in the Presence of Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing tools of segmented flow chemistry enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for different biotransformations with an imine reductase, aldoxime dehydratase, allene oxide synthase and cyclase, the power of flow processes is demonstrated, leading to a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion as well as a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up and a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield compared to the analogous batch processes.







Abstract
In modern process development, it is imperative to consider biocatalysis, and whole&#8208;cell catalysts often represent a favored form of such catalysts. However, the application of whole&#8208;cell catalysis in typical organic batch two&#8208;phase synthesis often struggles due to mass transfer limitations, emulsion formation, tedious work&#8208;up and, thus, low yields. Herein, we demonstrate that utilizing segmented flow tools enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for three different biotransformations, the power of such segmented flow processes is shown. For example, a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion from 34&#8201;% to &gt;99&#8201;% and a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up leading to a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield from 44&#8201;% to 65&#8201;% compared to the analogous batch process was achieved in such a flow process.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Uncovers Guest&#8208;Induced Distortions in a Supramolecular Organometallic Metallosquare</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) study on the encapsulation characteristics of a shape&#8208;adaptable organometallic metallocage, and demonstrate that IM&#8208;MS in combination with DFT calculations constitutes a reliable approach to quantify distortions experienced by the host upon guest encapsulation.







Abstract
The encapsulation of the tetracationic palladium metallosquare with four pyrene&#8208;bis&#8208;imidazolylidene ligands [1]4+ with a series of organic molecules was studied by Electrospray ionization Travelling Wave Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry (ESI TWIM&#8208;MS). The method allowed to determine the Collision Cross Sections (CCSs), which were used to assess the size changes experienced by the host upon encapsulation of the guest molecules. When fullerenes were used as guests, the host is expanded &#916;CCS 13&#8197;&#197;2 and 23&#8197;&#197;2, for C60 or C70, respectively. The metallorectangle [1]4+ was also used for the encapsulation of a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide (NTCDI), to form complexes of formula [(NTCDI)2(PAH)@1]4+. For these host:guest adducts, the ESI IM&#8208;MS studies revealed that [1]4+ is expanded by 47&#8211;49&#8197;&#197;2.. The energy&#8208;minimized structures of [1]4+, [C60@1]4+, [C70@1]4+, [(NTCDI)2(corannulene)@1]4+ in the gas phase were obtained by DFT calculations.Introduction

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pronged Pulmonary Gene Delivery Strategy: A Surface&#8208;Modified Fullerene Nanoparticle and a Hypotonic Vehicle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetra(piperazino)fullerene (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs), surface&#8208;coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), were engineered. The PEGylation allows the NPs to avoid interactions with mucin glycoproteins and phagocytic uptake by macrophages. After the NPs access the target lung cells, a hypotonic vehicle solution enhances their endocytosis via the osmotically driven regulatory volume effect, thereby providing highly efficient transgene expression.







Abstract
Inhaled gene therapy poses a unique potential of curing chronic lung diseases, which are currently managed primarily by symptomatic treatments. However, it has been challenging to achieve therapeutically relevant gene transfer efficacy in the lung due to the presence of numerous biological delivery barriers. Here, we introduce a simple approach that overcomes both extracellular and cellular barriers to enhance gene transfer efficacy in the lung in&#8197;vivo. We endowed tetra(piperazino)fullerene epoxide (TPFE)&#8208;based nanoparticles with non&#8208;adhesive surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings, thereby enabling the nanoparticles to cross the airway mucus gel layer and avoid phagocytic uptake by alveolar macrophages. In parallel, we utilized a hypotonic vehicle to facilitate endocytic uptake of the PEGylated nanoparticles by lung parenchymal cells via the osmotically driven regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanism. We demonstrate that this two&#8208;pronged delivery strategy provides safe, wide&#8208;spread and high&#8208;level transgene expression in the lungs of both healthy mice and mice with chronic lung diseases characterized by reinforced delivery barriers.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron&#8208;Transfer (PIET) Strategy for Selective Adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 in the MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Similarities in sizes, shapes, and physical properties between carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) and acetylene (C  2  H  2  ) make it a great challenge to separate the major impurity CO  2  from products in C  2  H  2  production. The use of porous materials is an appealing path to replace current very costly and energy&#8208;consuming technologies, such as solvent extraction and cryogenic distillation; however, high CO  2  /C  2  H  2  uptake ratio with minor adsorption of C  2  H  2  at standard pressure was only unexpectedly observed in scarce examples in recent years although the related research started early at 1950s, and general design strategies to realize this aim are still absent. This work has successfully developed an efficient PIET strategy and obtained the second highest CO  2  /C  2  H  2  adsorption ratio for porous materials in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MOF with a photochromism&#8208;active bipyridinium zwitterion. An unprecedented photocontrollable gate effect, owing to change of interannular dihedral after photoinduced generation of radical species, was also observed for the first time. These findings will inspire design and synthesis of porous materials for high efficient gas adsorption and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Unequilibrium of PdSn Intermetallic Nanocatalysts: From in situ Tailored Synthesis to Unexpected Hydrogenation Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective control on chemoselectivity to C=O over C=C bonds in catalytic hydrogenation reactions is uncommon with Pd&#8208;based catalysts because of the favored adsorption of C=C bonds. Here we report a unique orthorhombic PdSn intermetallic phase with unprecedented chemoselectivity toward C=O hydrogenation. We observed the formation and metastability of this PdSn phase  in situ  . During a natural cooling process, the PdSn nanoparticles readily revert to the favored Pd  3  Sn  2  phase. Instead, using a thermal quenching method, we prepared a pure&#8208;phase PdSn nanocatalyst. PdSn shows an &gt;96% selectivity toward hydrogenating C=O bonds of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, highest in reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Further study suggests that efficient quenching prevents the reversion from PdSn&#8208; to Pd  3  Sn  2  &#8208;structured surface, the key to the desired catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations and analysis of reaction kinetics provide an explanation for the observed high selectivity.</dc:description>

During a natural cooling process, the PdSn nanoparticles readily revert to the favored Pd  3  Sn  2  phase. Instead, using a thermal quenching method, we prepared a pure-phase PdSn nanocatalyst. PdSn shows an &amp;gt;96% selectivity toward hydrogenating C=O bonds of various &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, highest in reported Pd-based catalysts. Further study suggests that efficient quenching prevents the reversion from PdSn- to Pd  3  Sn  2  -structured surface, the key to the desired catalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations and analysis of reaction kinetics provide an explanation for the observed high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochromic polycationic organoboronium macrocycles with multiple redox states</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycationic macrocycles are attractive as they display unique molecular switching capabilities arising from their redox properties. Although diverse polycationic macrocycles have been developed, those based on cationic boron system remain very limited. We present herein the development of novel polycationic macrocycles by introducing organoboronium moieties into a conjugated organoboron macrocyclic framework. These macrocycles consist of four bipyridylboronium units that are connected by fluorene and either electron&#8208;deficient arylborane or electron&#8208;rich arylamine moieties. Electrochemical studies reveal that the macrocycles undergo reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes with transfer of up to 10 electrons. Switchable electrochromic behavior is demonstrated via spectroelectrochemical studies and the observed color changes are rationalized by correlation with computed electronic transitions using DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Conversion to Methanol in a Bi&#8208;Functional Zeolite Catalytic Membrane Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of sequestrated CO 2  to methanol can reduce CO 2  emission and establish a sustainable carbon circuit. However, the transformation of CO 2  into methanol is challenging because of the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and the deactivation of catalysts by water. In the present work, different reactor types have been evaluated for CO 2  catalytic hydrogenation to methanol. Best results have been obtained in a bi&#8208;functional catalytic membrane reactor (CMR) based on a zeolite LTA membrane and a catalytic Cu&#8208;ZnO&#8208;Al 2  O 3  &#8208;ZrO 2  layer on top. Due to the in&#8208;situ and rapid removal of the produced water from the catalytic layer through the hydrophilic zeolite LTA membrane, it is effective to break the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, thus significantly increasing the CO 2  conversion (36.1%) and methanol selectivity (100%). Further, the catalyst deactivation by the produced water can be effectively inhibited, thus maintaining a high long&#8208;term activity of the CMR.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of supramolecular block co&#8208;polymers (BCP) with

small monomers and predictive sequence requires elegant molecular

design and synthetic strategies. Herein we report the unparalleled

synthesis of tri&#8208;component supramolecular BCPs with tunable

microstructure by a kinetically controlled sequential seeded

supramolecular polymerization of fluorescent &#960;&#8208;conjugated

monomers. Core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivatives

with different core substitution and appended with &#946;&#8208;sheet forming

peptide side chains provide perfect monomer design with spectral

complementarity, pathway complexity and minimal structural

mismatch to synthesize and characterize the multi&#8208;component BCPs.

The distinct fluorescent nature of various cNDI monomers aids the

spectroscopic probing of the seeded growth process and the

microscopic visualization of resultant supramolecular BCPs using

Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Kinetically controlled

sequential seeded supramolecular polymerization presented here is

reminiscent of the multi&#8208;step synthesis of covalent BCPs via living

constructing unique functional organic heterostructures for various

         <title>Chiral Induction in Buckminsterfullerene Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral induction is an emerging topic of interest in various areas of chemistry because of its relationship to the elusive mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature. Buckminsterfullerene (C60) with the shape of a highly symmetric truncated icosahedron has rarely been referred for chiral induction due to the difficult symmetry breaking. In this work, we demonstrate that a chiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) structures can provide a key field for chiral induction. C60  could be incorporated into the chiral nanochannels of the MOF using an in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy. The circular dichroism spectra of the resulting nanocomposites showed an intense chiral signal in the absorption region of C60  . Experimental and theoretical studies showed that this unprecedented chiral induction of C60  was attributed to hybridization of the molecular orbitals through a close association with the pore surface of the MOF. Our method can endow highly symmetric achiral compounds with chirality, paving the new way toward fabrication of novel chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulphur&#8208;embedded Hydrocarbon Belts: The Synthesis, Structure and Redox Chemistry of Cyclothianthrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclothianthrenes, a series of sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts proposed a decade ago, were successfully constructed through a stepwise bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The belt [6]cyclothianthrene ([6]CT) is the smallest and most strained member of the family yet reported. Both [6]CT and [8]CT are the first examples of cyclothianthrene characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. An unprecedented chiral belt [7]CT and a M&#246;bius&#8208;shaped [9]CT were also achieved via modular synthesis. Crystallographic and computational studies show that belts [6]CT~[8]CT have prism&#8208;like conformations with well&#8208;defined tubular cavities which have potential for guest molecule inclusion. Cyclic voltammograms further revealed that these belts are redox&#8208;active. The success of constructing sulphur&#8208;embedded hydrocarbon belts, i.e. cyclothianthrenes, greatly enriches the chemistry of heteroatom&#8208;doped molecular belts and tubes.</dc:description>

         <title>Record Productivity and Unprecedented Molecular&#8208;Weight for Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing polyesters with high molecular weight (  M  n  ) through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides remains a major challenge. Herein, we communicate a metal&#8208;free, highly active, and high thermoresistance system for the ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to prepare polyesters (13 examples). The organoboron catalysts can endure a reaction temperature as high as 180 &#176;C for the ROCOP of cyclohexane oxide (CHO) with phthalic anhydride (PA) without the observation of any side reactions. The average  M  n  of the produced poly(CHO&#8208;  alt  &#8208;PA) climbed to 94.5 kDa with low polydispersity (  &#208;  = 1.19). In addition, an unprecedented turnover number of 9900, equivalent to an efficiency of 7.4 kg of polyester/g of catalyst, was achieved at a feed ratio of CHO/PA/catalyst = 20000:10000:1 at 150 &#176;C. Kinetic studies, crystal structure analysis,  11  B NMR spectra, and DFT calculations provided mechanistic justification for the effectiveness of the catalyst system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Epigenetic programming of cells requires methylation of deoxycytidines (dC) to 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;dC (mdC) followed by oxidation to 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC) and 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). Subsequent transformation of fdC and cadC back to dC by various pathways establishes a chemical intra&#8208;genetic control circle. One of the discussed pathways involves the Tdg&#8208;independent deformylation of fdC directly to dC. Here we report the synthesis of a fluorinated fdC feeding probe (F&#8208;fdC), to study direct deformylation to F&#8208;dC. The synthesis was performed along a novel pathway that circumvents any F&#8208;dC as a reaction intermediate to avoid contamination interference. Feeding of F&#8208;fdC and observation of F&#8208;dC formation in vivo allowed us to gain new insights into the Tdg&#8208;independent removal process. While deformylation was shown to occur in stem cells, we here provide data that prove deformylation also in different somatic cell types. To study how the process is influenced by cell division, we investigated active demethylation in a non&#8208;dividing neurogenin&#8208;inducable system of iPS cells that differentiate into bipolar neurons. Our data together underpin the epigenetic relevance of stable fdC nucleosides in the genome in a variety of cell lines.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylations of functionalized alkenes assisted by &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a fundamental type of carbonylation reactions, alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylations of unsaturated hydrocarbons constitutes one of the most important industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis. Since the birth of asymmetric catalysis, the enantioselective variant of such transformation has been recognized as a direct and efficient approach for the synthesis of chiral carbonyl compounds. However, owing to the difficulties in controlling multi&#8208;selectivities for asymmetric hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, to date this reaction is typically limited to vinylarenes and analogues. In this work, a highly efficient asymmetric alkoxy&#8208; and hydroxy&#8208;carbonylations of &#946;&#8208;carbonyl functionalized alkenes was developed, providing a practical and ready access to various densely functionalized chiral molecules with high optical purity from broadly available alkenes, CO, and nucleophiles (&gt;90 examples, 84&#8208;99% ee). This protocol features mild reaction conditions and broad substrate scope, and the products can be readily transformed into a diverse array of chiral heterocycles. Control experiments revealed the key role of the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group in determining the enantioselectivity and promoting the activity, which facilitates chiral induction by coordination to the transition&#8208;metal as rationalized by DFT calculations. The strategy of utilizing an innate functional group as the directing group on the alkene substrate might find further applications in catalytic asymmetric hydrocarbonylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;current&#8208;density and high&#8208;area&#8208;capacity operation of Li metal anodes offers promising opportunities for high&#8208;performing next&#8208;generation batteries. However, high&#8208;rate Li deposition suffers from undesired Li&#8208;ion depletion especially at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which compromises achievable capacity and lifetime. Here, electronegative graphene quantum dots are synthesized and assembled into an ultra&#8208;thin overlayer capable of efficient Li&#8208;ion adsorbing at the nanoscale on Li metal to fully relieve Li&#8208;ion depletion. The protected Li anode achieves long&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 1000 h at both superior current density of 60 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  and areal capacity of 60 mAh&#183;cm  &#8208;2  .&#160;Implementation of the protected anode allows for the construction of Li&#8208;air full battery with both enhanced rate capability and cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Defect Passivation and Control of Energy Level Alignment for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to passivate defects and modulate the interface energy&#8208;level alignment (IEA) is key to boost the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a robust route that simultaneously allows defect passivation and reduced energy difference between perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL) via the judicious placement of polar chlorine&#8208;terminated silane molecules at the interface. Density functional theory (DFT) points to effective passivation of the halide vacancies on perovskite surface by the silane chlorine atoms. An integrated experimental and DFT study demonstrates that the dipole layer formed by the silane molecules decreases the perovskite work function, imparting an Ohmic character to the perovskite/HTL contact. The corresponding PSCs manifest a nearly 20% increase in power conversion efficiency over pristine devices and a markedly enhanced device stability. As such, the use of polar molecules to passivate defects and tailor the IEA in PSCs presents a promising platform to advance the performance of PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Sponge Method: X&#8208;ray Structure Analysis of Small Molecules via Post&#8208;Orientation within Porous Crystals. Principle and Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Concept Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review article discusses, along with historical background, the principle and the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies of crystalline sponge (CS) method, a new single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCD) for the analysis of the structures of small molecules without sample crystallization. The method uses single crystalline porous coordination networks, called crystalline sponges, that can absorb small guest molecules into the pores. The absorbed guest molecules are ordered via molecular recognition in the pores and become observable by conventional SCD analysis. [[(ZnI2)3(tpt)2]&#8226;x(solvent)]ncomplex (tpt = tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine) was first proposed as a crystalline sponge and has been most generally used. Crystalline sponges developed later by the other groups are also&#160;discussed&#160;here. The principle of the CS method can be described as &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization&#8221; of the absorbed guest, whose ordering is templated by the pre&#8208;latticed cavities. The method has been widely applied to synthetic chemistry as well as natural product studies, for which proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples will be shown here.</dc:description>

         <title>Au/Pt&#8208;Egg&#8208;in&#8208;Nest Nanomotor for Glucose&#8208;Powered Catalytic Motion and Enhanced Molecular Transport to Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructures converting chemical energy to mechanical work by using benign metabolic fuels, have huge implications in biomedical science. Here, we introduce Au/Pt&#8208;based Janus nanostructures, resembling to &#8216;egg&#8208;in&#8208;nest&#8217; morphology (Au/Pt&#8208;ENs), showing enhanced motion as a result of dual enzyme&#8208;relay&#8208;like catalytic cascade in physiological biomedia, and in turn showing molecular&#8208;laden transport to living cells. We developed dynamic&#8208;casting approach using silica yolk&#8208;shell nanoreactors: first, to install a large Au&#8208;seed fixing the silica&#8208;yolk aside while providing the anisotropically confined concave hollow nanospace to grow curved Pt&#8208;dendritic networks. Owing to the intimately interfaced Au and Pt catalytic sites integrated in a unique anisotropic nest&#8208;like morphology, Au/Pt&#8208;ENs exhibited high diffusion rates and displacements as the result of glucose&#8208;converted oxygen concentration gradient. High diffusiophoresis in cell culture media increased the nanomotor&#8208;membrane interaction events, in turn facilitated the cell internalization. In addition, the porous network of Au/Pt&#8208;ENs facilitated the drug&#8208;molecule cargo loading and delivery to the living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>AgII&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic ambient CH4&#160;functionalization inspired by HSAB theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an efficient chemical transformation pathway of ambient CH  4  &#160;functionalization is an ongoing challenge and the key resides on the discovery of new catalytic systems. The hard&#8208;soft acid&#8208;base (HSAB) theory suggests that high&#8208;valent transition metals, as soft class (b) Lewis acids based on Pearson&#8217;s classification, are suitable candidates for CH  4  activation due to methyl moiety&#8217;s relatively low value of chemical hardness.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing an efficient chemical transformation pathway of ambient CH  4  &#160;functionalization is an ongoing challenge and the key resides on the discovery of new catalytic systems. The hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) theory suggests that high-valent transition metals, as soft class (b) Lewis acids based on Pearson&#8217;s classification, are suitable candidates for CH  4  activation due to methyl moiety&#8217;s relatively low value of chemical hardness.

         <title>A Light&#8208;controllable Chemical Modulation of m6A RNA Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactive small molecules with photo&#8208;removable protecting groups have provided spatial and temporal control of corresponding biological effects. Herein we presented the design, synthesis, computational and experimental evaluation of the first photo&#8208;activatable small&#8208;molecule methyltransferase agonist. By blocking the functional N&#8208;H group on MPCH with a photo&#8208;removable  ortho  &#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety, we have developed a promising photo&#8208;caged compound that had completely concealed its biological activity. Short UV light exposure of cells treated with that caged molecule in a few minutes resulted in a considerable hypermethylation of m  6  A modification in transcriptome RNAs, implicating a rapid release of the parent active compound. This study validates for the first time the photo&#8208;activatable small organic molecular concept in the field of RNA epigenetic research, which represents a novel tool in spatiotemporal and cellular modulation approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Linked Cyclopentadienyl Rhodium(III) Complexes&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Arylation of Benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;Diazonaphthoquinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands (BOCps) bearing an oxygen linker was developed. The BOCpRh complexes are powerful catalysts in an asymmetric C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones to construct axially chiral heterobiaryls. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this reaction is likely to proceed via an electrophilic C&#8722;H rhodation and subsequent coupling with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium (CpRh) complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions have witnessed a significant progress in organic synthesis. In sharp contrast, the reported chiral Cp ligands are limited to C&#8208;linked Cp and are often synthetically challenging. To address these issues, we have developed a novel class of tunable chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing oxygen linkers, which were efficient catalysts for C&#8722;H arylation of benzo[h]quinolines with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones, affording axially chiral heterobiaryls in excellent yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 98.5:1.5 er). Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction is likely to proceed by electrophilic C&#8722;H activation, and followed by coupling of the cyclometalated rhodium(III) complex with 1&#8208;diazonaphthoquinones.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site vs. Cluster Catalysis in High Temperature Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal active sites speciation on Pt&#8208;CHA is discussed for different high&#8208;temperature oxidation reactions, including 16O2/18O2 isotopic exchange experiments, methane combustion, and CO oxidation. Structure&#8211;performance relationships built on subtle changes in the active sites under working conditions are revealed.







Abstract
The behavior of single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters was investigated for high&#8208;temperature oxidations. The high stability of these molecular sites in CHA is a key to intrinsic structure&#8211;performance descriptions of elemental steps such as O2 dissociation, and subsequent oxidation catalysis. Subtle changes in the atomic structure of Pt are responsible for drastic changes in performance driven by specific gas/metal/support interactions. Whereas single Pt atoms and Pt clusters (&gt; ca. 1&#8197;nm) are unable to activate, scramble, and desorb two O2 molecules at moderate T (200&#8201;&#176;C), clusters &lt;1&#8197;nm do so catalytically, but undergo oxidative fragmentation. Oxidation of alkanes at high T is attributed to stable single Pt atoms, and the C&#8208;H cleavage is inferred to be rate&#8208;determining and less sensitive to changes in metal nuclearity compared to its effect on O2 scrambling. In contrast, when combustion involves CO, catalysis is dominated by metal clusters, not single Pt atoms.

&lt;p&gt;Metal active sites speciation on Pt-CHA is discussed for different high-temperature oxidation reactions, including &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isotopic exchange experiments, methane combustion, and CO oxidation. Structure&#8211;performance relationships built on subtle changes in the active sites under working conditions are revealed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The behavior of single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters was investigated for high-temperature oxidations. The high stability of these molecular sites in CHA is a key to intrinsic structure&#8211;performance descriptions of elemental steps such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation, and subsequent oxidation catalysis. Subtle changes in the atomic structure of Pt are responsible for drastic changes in performance driven by specific gas/metal/support interactions. Whereas single Pt atoms and Pt clusters (&amp;gt; ca. 1&#8197;nm) are unable to activate, scramble, and desorb two O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules at moderate T (200&#8201;&#176;C), clusters &amp;lt;1&#8197;nm do so catalytically, but undergo oxidative fragmentation. Oxidation of alkanes at high T is attributed to stable single Pt atoms, and the C-H cleavage is inferred to be rate-determining and less sensitive to changes in metal nuclearity compared to its effect on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrambling.

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing a [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton ([6]CPP) was conveniently synthesized from calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt showed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and a deep cavity, and also exhibited strong green fluorescence and a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with a [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane both in solution and in the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with a quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 2.02&#8197;eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits has specific optoelectronic properties that will promote wide applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.

         <title>The Hole&#8208;Tunneling Heterojunction of Hematite&#8208;Based Photoanodes Accelerates Photosynthetic Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hole&#8208;tunneling heterojunctions of atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;Sn&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanodes were designed rationally to achieve an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% in the all&#8208;solar&#8208;driven APS cells equipped with a Ni&#8208;SNG catalyst cathode for CO2 conversion into syngas with excellent stability for 30&#8197;h under 450&#8197;nm LED irradation.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (SMIS) heterojunctions based on Sn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 nanorods (SF NRs) were designed by combining atomic deposition of an Al2O3 overlayer with chemical grafting of a RuOx hole&#8208;collector for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion. The RuOx&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;SF photoanode with a 3.0&#8197;nm thick Al2O3 overlayer gave a &gt;5&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced IPCE value of 52.0&#8201;% under 370&#8197;nm light irradiation at 1.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, compared to the bare SF NRs. The dielectric field mediated the charge dynamics at the Al2O3/SF NRs interface. Accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes on the surface of the SF NRs photoabsorber aids fast tunneling transfer of hot holes to single&#8208;atom RuOx species, accelerating the O2&#8208;evolving reaction kinetics. The maximal CO&#8208;evolution rate of 265.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved by integration of double SIMS&#8208;3 photoanodes with a single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;doped graphene CO2&#8208;reduction&#8208;catalyst cathode; an overall quantum efficiency of 5.7&#8201;% was recorded under 450&#8197;nm light irradiation.

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Hypervalent Bromine(III) Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward electrochemical synthesis of chelation&#8208;stabilized hypervalent bromine(III) compounds is presented. The electrolysis proceeds at room temperature in an undivided cell under galvanostatic conditions, giving &#955;3&#8208;bromanes in good yields on the gram scale from bromoarenes. The reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes can be enhanced by Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid additives as demonstrated in &#955;3&#8208;bromane&#8208;mediated oxidative biaryl formation.







Abstract
In sharp contrast to hypervalent iodine(III) compounds, the isoelectronic bromine(III) counterparts have been little studied to date. This knowledge gap is mainly attributed to the difficult&#8208;to&#8208;control reactivity of &#955;3&#8208;bromanes as well as to their challenging preparation from the highly toxic and corrosive BrF3 precursor. In this context, we present a straightforward and scalable approach to chelation&#8208;stabilized &#955;3&#8208;bromanes by anodic oxidation of parent aryl bromides possessing two coordinating hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypropanyl substituents. A series of para&#8208;substituted &#955;3&#8208;bromanes with remarkably high redox potentials spanning a range from 1.86&#8197;V to 2.60&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgNO3 was synthesized by the electrochemical method. We demonstrate that the intrinsic reactivity of the bench&#8208;stable bromine(III) species can be unlocked by addition of a Lewis or a Br&#248;nsted acid. The synthetic utility of the &#955;3&#8208;bromane activation is exemplified by oxidative C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond forming reactions.

A porous molecular crystal assembled by close&#8208;packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate efficiently captures CO2, as reported by Ognjen &#352;. Miljani&#263;, Teng&#8208;Hao Chen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102813). The square&#8208;shaped 7.1&#215;7.1 &#197; pores enable excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects. Moderately strong CO2&#8211;framework interactions allow easy regeneration of the adsorbent and its use in pressure swing adsorption.

         <title>Degradation in Order: Simple and Versatile One&#8208;Pot Combination of Two Macromolecular Concepts to Encode Diverse and Spatially Regulated Degradability Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual polymerization approach creates new possibilities to access polymeric materials with sequence&#8208;controlled primary structure and diverse degradable bonds. The methodology is overall simple and effective and involves an in situ organocatalyst switch, which leads to different polymerization mechanisms, and as a consequence, specific degradability functions are encoded.







Abstract
The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple, yet powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP occur sequentially at room temperature when the organocatalytic conditions are switched from basic to acidic, and each allows the encoding of specific degradable bonds. ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;ends enables the formation of acetal bonds and high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion within the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates, while being simple, effective, and atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.

         <title>Introduction of a Luminophore into Generic Polymers via Mechanoradical Coupling with a Prefluorescent Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. The method allows the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel strategy for introducing a luminophore into generic polymers facilitated by mechanical stimulation. In this study, polymeric mechanoradicals were formed in situ under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. This method allowed the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene. These results indicate that the present mechanoradical coupling strategy may help to transform existing commodity polymers into more valuable functional materials.

         <title>Amplified Interfacial Effect in an Atomically Dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd 2D Inverse Nanocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd ultrathin 2D inverse nanocatalyst with amplified oxide/metal interface effects may serve as an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed oxide&#8208;on&#8208;metal inverse nanocatalysts provide a blueprint to amplify the strong oxide&#8211;metal interactions for heterocatalysis but remain a grand challenge in fabrication. Here we report a 2D inverse nanocatalyst, RuOx&#8208;on&#8208;Pd nanosheets, by in situ creating atomically dispersed RuOx/Pd interfaces densely on ultrathin Pd nanosheets via a one&#8208;pot synthesis. The product displays unexpected performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium, which represents 8.0&#8208; and 22.4&#8208;fold enhancement in mass activity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts, respectively, showcasing an excellent Pt&#8208;alternative cathode electrocatalyst for fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations validate that the RuOx/Pd interface can accumulate partial charge from the 2D Pd host and subtly change the adsorption configuration of O2 to facilitate the O&#8722;O bond cleavage. Meanwhile, the d&#8208;band center of Pd nanosubstrates is effectively downshifted, realizing weakened oxygen binding strength.

         <title>Hierarchical Two&#8208;Level Supramolecular Chirality of an Achiral Anthracene&#8208;Based Tetracationic Nanotube in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates in water has led to an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube showing two levels of supramolecular chirality. This nanotube, which can adopt M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformations, exhibits adaptive chiral recognition with opposite CD spectra for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP, and a strong excimer showing strong circularly polarized luminescence ((+)&#8208;CPL; glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) with ATP in water.







Abstract
Herein, we report an achiral anthracene&#8208;based tetracationic nanotube (1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;) that shows two levels of supramolecular chirality: namely, conformationally adaptive host&#8211;guest complexation with nucleoside triphosphates (e.g. ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and twisted packing of the chiral host&#8211;guest complexes in water. Interestingly, achiral 1&#8901;4Cl&#8722; exhibits chiral recognition for ATP/GTP and CTP/UTP through structural transformation of its intramolecular M&#8208; and P&#8208;twisted conformation as the first level of supramolecular chirality, which leads to adaptive chirality with opposite CD responses. Furthermore, the formation of chiral M&#8208;1&#8901;4Cl&#8722;&#8835;ATP can promote an intermolecular P&#8208;twisted dimeric packing of anthracene rings as the second level of supramolecular chirality to achieve assembled chirality with strong circularly polarized luminescence arising from the excimer ((+)&#8208;CPL, glum&#8776;10&#8722;2) in water.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;In&#8208;Conjugation&#8208;Boosted Organic Semiconductor Gas Sensor Operating at High Temperature and Immune to Moisture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust NO2 sensor device based on an ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation structure maintained its performance at high temperature, which counteracted the effects of humidity (see picture; NO2 blue/red, H2O green/yellow). Charge transfer between NO2 and the chemiresistor was more efficient at 100&#8201;&#176;C than at room temperature. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) NO2 detection limit and showed the highest sensitivity of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors.







Abstract
Organic electrical gas sensors have been developed for many decades because of their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, their industrialization is severely hindered by their intrinsic humidity susceptibility and poor recovery. Conventional organic sensory materials can only operate at room temperature owing to their weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we demonstrate using a croconate polymer (poly&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylcroconate) that the &#8220;ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8221; concept enables organic gas sensors to operate at 100&#8201;&#176;C and 70&#8201;% relative humidity with almost complete recovery. The fabricated sensor had a parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion (ppb) detection limit for NO2 and showed the highest sensitivity (2526&#8197;ppm&#8722;1 at 40&#8197;ppb) of all reported NO2 chemiresistive sensors. Furthermore, charge transfer increased with temperature. Theoretical calculations and in situ FTIR spectra confirmed the ion&#8208;in&#8208;conjugation&#8208;inspired hydrogen bond as key for excellent sensitivity. A NO2 alarm system was assembled to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensor.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Imido Cobalt Complexes with Imidyl Radical Character**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syntheses and structures of rare trigonal, high&#8208;spin imido cobalt complexes are presented, which have very long Co&#8722;N bonds. Comprehensive spectroscopic studies reveal a radical imidyl character of the imide unit. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and show that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl radical character. The imido cobalt complexes are able to mediate intra&#8208; or intermolecular C&#8722;H bond activation.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a variety of trigonal imido cobalt complexes [Co(NAryl)L2]&#8722;, (L=N(Dipp)SiMe3), Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with very long Co&#8722;NAryl bonds of around 1.75&#8197;&#197;. Their electronic structure was interrogated using a variety of physical and spectroscopic methods such as EPR or X&#8208;Ray absorption spectroscopy which leads to their description as highly unusual imidyl cobalt complexes. Computational analyses corroborate these findings and further reveal that the high&#8208;spin state is responsible for the imidyl character. Exchange of the Dipp substituent on the imide by the smaller mesityl function (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) effectuates the unexpected Me3Si shift from the ancillary ligand set to the imidyl nitrogen, revealing a highly reactive, nucleophilic character of the imidyl unit.

         <title>Controlling Catenation in Germanium(I) Chemistry through Hemilability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the rational construction of chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds is reported, which exploits hemilabile ancillary ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The resulting oligo&#8208;dimetallyne chains feature alternating single and double metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
We present a novel approach for constructing chains of Group&#8197;14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8211;metal bonds that exploits hemilabile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) &#8220;protecting groups&#8221; and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2=2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH2)2C6H3)&#8212;featuring hemilabile NiPr2 donors&#8212;yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4 (2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4 chain. 2 represents a novel type of a linear homo&#8208;catenated GeI compound featuring unsupported E&#8722;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4 and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2 (4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2 (5), respectively. The use of smaller N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8208;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2 dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2 through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated GeI centres.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Magnesium&#8208;Air Battery Based on Dual&#8208;Layer Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte was designed to simultaneously prevent the corrosion of Mg anode and production of the dense passive layer in a Mg&#8208;air battery. The resulting Mg&#8208;air battery exhibited a specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total anodic weight and an energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total weight of anode and air electrode. It was further made into a fiber shape with high flexibility.







Abstract
Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the total Mg anode (99.3&#8201;% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroborations with Broad Scope</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(hmds)2 enables clean hydroborations of C=X electrophiles (nitriles, amides, esters, pyridines, carbonates, diimides) at 20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C. The protocol was applied to polymer degradations (polyesters, polycarbonates) and CO2 reduction. Mechanistic studies indicate the catalytic role of MnII hydrides, for example, the isolated cluster [MnH(hmds)]6.







Abstract
Reductive transformations of easily available oxidized matter are at the heart of synthetic manipulation and chemical valorization. The applications of catalytic hydrofunctionalization benefit from the use of liquid reducing agents and operationally facile setups. Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroborations provide a highly prolific platform for reductive valorizations of stable C=X electrophiles. Here, we report an especially facile, broad&#8208;scope reduction of various functions including carbonyls, carboxylates, pyridines, carbodiimides, and carbonates under very mild conditions with the inexpensive pre&#8208;catalyst Mn(hmds)2. The reaction could be successfully applied to depolymerizations.

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge toward realizing Li metal anode has been the lack of stable SEI between Li and the electrolyte. We report an approach of using oxygen to induce unique decompositions of organic phosphate solvent, where simple reactions favor the formation of a stable SEI. This method permits repeated Li stripping/plating on Li metal in a flame retardant electrolyte. The results promise safe operations of Li in next generation batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant.

     alt="Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical challenge toward realizing Li metal anode has been the lack of stable SEI between Li and the electrolyte. We report an approach of using oxygen to induce unique decompositions of organic phosphate solvent, where simple reactions favor the formation of a stable SEI. This method permits repeated Li stripping/plating on Li metal in a flame retardant electrolyte. The results promise safe operations of Li in next generation batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next-generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and poly-phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self-limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell, more than 300&#8197;cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Prototypical Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li-ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhancing Thermocatalytic Activities by Upshifting the d&#8208;Band Center of Exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe Ternary Alloy Nanoparticles for the Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe nanoparticles were produced by topotactic exsolution. Compared to bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, the ternary Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the dry reforming of methane. DFT calculations indicated the enhanced activity originates from the optimal upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a feasible solution to address the reduction of greenhouse gases stipulated by the Paris Climate Agreement, given that it adds value by converting trivial gases, CO2 and CH4, simultaneously into useful syngas. However, the conventional Ni catalyst undergoes deactivation due to carbon coking and particle agglomeration. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient and durable DRM catalyst: exsolved Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe ternary alloy nanoparticles on the layered perovskite PrBaMn1.7Co0.1Ni0.2O5+&#948; produced by topotactic exsolution. This method readily allows the generation of a larger number of exsolved nanoparticles with enhanced catalytic activity above that of Ni monometallic and Co&#8208;Ni bimetallic particles. The enhancement is achieved by the upshift of the d&#8208;band center of Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Fe relative to those of Co&#8208;Ni and Ni, meaning easier charge donation to the adsorbate. Furthermore, the exsolved catalyst shows exceptional stability, with continuous DRM operation for about 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Electrochemical Measurements Reveal Reactive Oxygen Species in Stress Granules**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arsenite&#8208;induced stress granules isolated from both non&#8208;cancer and cancer cells contain reactive oxygen species as revealed by amperometric measurements with Pt or platinized carbon microelectrodes. This finding supports a role for SGs as signaling hubs and unveils a correlation between SG biology and pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases and some cancers.







Abstract
Stress granules (SGs) are membrane&#8208;less organelles that assemble in the cytoplasm to organize cellular contents and promote rapid adaptation during stress. To understand how SGs contribute to physiological functions, we used electrochemical measurements to detect electroactive species in SGs. With amperometry, we discovered that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are encapsulated inside arsenite&#8208;induced SGs, and H2O2 is the main species. The release kinetics of H2O2 from single SGs and the number of H2O2 molecules were quantified. The discovery that SGs contain ROS implicates them as communicators of the cellular stresses rather than a simple endpoint. This may explain how SGs regulate cellular metabolism and stress responses. This may also help better understand their cytoprotective functions in pathological conditions associated with SGs such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cancers and viral infections.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zinc&#8208;Doped Silica Nanospheres Simultaneously Featuring Stable Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy was developed for directly preparing zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) in water, which can produce stable fluorescence (UV on) and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UV off) in water.







Abstract
Fluorescence and phosphorescence are known as two kinds of fundamental optical signals, which have been used for myriad applications. To date, simultaneous activation of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission in the aqueous phase remains a big challenge. We prepare zinc&#8208;doped silica nanospheres (Zn@SiNSs) with fluorescence and RTP properties using a facile hydrothermal synthetic strategy. For the as&#8208;prepared Zn@SiNSs, the recombination of electrons and holes in defects and defect&#8208;stabilized excitons derived from oxygen vacancy/C=N bonds lead to the production of stable fluorescence and long&#8208;lived RTP (emission lasting for &#8776;9&#8197;s, quantum yield (QY): &#8776;33.6&#8201;%, RTP lifetime: &#8776;236&#8197;ms). The internal Si&#8722;O bonded networks and hydrophilic surface in Zn@SiNSs can reduce nonradiative decay to form self&#8208;protective RTP, and also provide high water solubility, excellent pH&#8208; and photostability.

         <title>Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

         <dc:description>
Controllable Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella can break thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of CO2 reduction reaction and achieve the superior CO2 electroreduction performance.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts facilitate CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) to produce multi&#8208;carbon products. However, the roles of Cu0 and Cu+ and the mechanistic understanding remain elusive. This paper describes the controllable construction of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ sites derived from the well&#8208;dispersed cupric oxide particles supported on copper phyllosilicate lamella to enhance CO2ER performance. 20&#8201;% Cu/CuSiO3 shows the superior CO2ER performance with 51.8&#8201;% C2H4 Faraday efficiency at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode during the 6&#8197;hour test. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. The enhancement in CO2ER activity is mainly attributed to the synergism of Cu0&#8208;Cu+ pairs: Cu0 activates CO2 and facilitates the following electron transfers; Cu+ strengthens *CO adsorption to further boost C&#8722;C coupling. We provide a strategy to rationally design Cu&#8208;based catalysts with viable valence states to boost CO2ER.

         <title>A Promising NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Sensor for Peptide&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Kidney Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biological metabolism pathways of fluorophores can be altered by elaborately selected hydrophilic peptides. Hepatic cleared organic molecules and fast renal cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugated to a peptide with high polarity. Based on the selected peptide, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression.







Abstract
Kidney disease is usually &#8220;silent&#8221; at the early stage but can lead to severe kidney failure later on. The development of bioimaging probes with rapid distribution and long&#8208;term retention in the kidney is significant for the precise diagnosis of renal diseases. Here, a strategy for the peptide&#8208;mediated delivery and long&#8208;term accumulation (&gt;48&#8197;h) of second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorophores into the kidney is demonstrated. It is shown that both the hepatic&#8208;cleared organic molecules and fast renal&#8208;cleared ultrasmall nanoparticles can be retained in the kidney after conjugation to the peptide with high polarity. Moreover, a ROS&#8208;responsive activatable bilateral NIR&#8208;II sensor was designed based on the kidney targeting peptide, which enables both in&#8197;vivo long&#8208;term kidney monitoring and in&#8197;vitro urine analysis. The capability of the peptide&#8208;based sensor to detect early kidney injury and report on kidney dysfunctional progression is particularly crucial for chemotherapy regimen optimization and timely renoprotective intervention during medication.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;Based Nanoparticles Combine X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Nitrosative Stress with Autophagy Management for Hypoxic Prostate Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting protective autophagy and inducing lethal nitrosative stress based on ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP. After entering tumor cells, the released 2&#8208;nitroimidazole ligands capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to produce NO2&#8722;, and the Zn2+ inhibits the migration and invasion of tumor cells.







Abstract
Although reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor treatments are predominant in clinical applications, ROS&#8208;induced protective autophagy promotes cell survival, especially in hypoxic tumors. Herein, X&#8208;ray triggered nitrite (NO2&#8722;) is used for hypoxic prostate cancer therapy by inhibiting autophagy and inducing nitrosative stress based on an electrophilic zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP). After internalization of pH&#8208;responsive ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles, electrophilic ligands and Zn2+ are delivered into cancer cells. Electrophilic ligands can not only consume GSH under hypoxia but also capture low&#8208;energy electrons derived from X&#8208;rays to generate NO2&#8722;, which inhibits autophagy and further elevates lethal nitrosative stress levels. In addition, dissociated Zn2+ specifically limits the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through ion interference. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results indicate that ZIF&#8208;82&#8208;PVP nanoparticles under X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively promote the apoptosis of hypoxic prostate cancer cells. Overall, this nitrosative stress&#8208;mediated tumor therapy strategy provides a novel approach targeting hypoxic tumors.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Nano&#8208;Ferroelectrics for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is induced by engineering the surface reconstruction, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb piezocatalytic overall water&#8208;splitting activity.







Abstract
Developing nano&#8208;ferroelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric performance for piezocatalysts used in water splitting is highly desired but also challenging, especially with respect to reaching large piezo&#8208;potentials that fully align with required redox levels. Herein, heteroepitaxial strain in BaTiO3 nanoparticles with a designed porous structure is successfully induced by engineering their surface reconstruction to dramatically enhance their piezoelectricity. The strain coherence can be maintained throughout the nanoparticle bulk, resulting in a significant increase of the BaTiO3 tetragonality and thus its piezoelectricity. Benefiting from high piezoelectricity, the as&#8208;synthesized blue&#8208;colored BaTiO3 nanoparticles possess a superb overall water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rates of 159&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is almost 130 times higher than that of the pristine BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Thus, this work provides a generic approach for designing highly efficient piezoelectric nanomaterials by strain engineering that can be further extended to various other perovskite oxides, including SrTiO3, thereby enhancing their potential for piezoelectric catalysis.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Inspired Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Discriminator for Differential Diagnosis of Cancer Cell Subtypes</title>

An azidosugar ZIF&#8208;8 carrier camouflaged with cancer cell membranes was devised to mimic cancer cell behaviors, and it accomplished cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes selective MGL for different breast cancer subtypes.







Abstract
Metabolic glycan labeling (MGL) followed by bioorthogonal chemistry provides a powerful tool for tumor imaging and therapy. However, selectively metabolic labeling of cells or tissues of interest remains a challenge. Particularly, owing to tumor heterogeneity including tumor subtypes and interpatient heterogeneity, it is far more difficult to realize tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;selective metabolic labeling for precise diagnosis. Inspired by nature, we designed azidosugar&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks camouflaged with cancer cell membranes to accomplish cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective MGL in vivo. With abundant receptors, this biomimetic platform not only selectively targets homotypic cells but also realizes different breast cancer subtype&#8208;selective MGL. Moreover, the endo/lysosomal&#8208;escaped ZIF&#8208;8 can make azidosugar escape from lysosomes and accelerate its metabolic incorporation. This strategy also takes advantage of cancer&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived cell membranes, which may have huge potential for personalized diagnosis and therapy.

         <title>Polysulfates Block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Uptake through Electrostatic Interactions**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the positively charged patches of RBD of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and block viral interaction with host cells for infection inhibition. The synthetic linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) exhibits higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin, but lower anticoagulant activity. Therefore, it is considered to be a promising substitute for heparin in clinical applications.







Abstract
Here we report that negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 via electrostatic interactions. Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with an IC50 of 67&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (approx. 1.6&#8197;&#956;m). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60&#8208;fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC50: 4084&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind more strongly to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Mechanism of the Arene&#8208;Limited Nondirected C&#8722;H Activation of Arenes with Palladium**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanistic study of the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes with palladium catalysts and the arene as limiting reagent is described. A detailed experimental and computational investigation supports a 1:1:1 complex of palladium and the two complementary ligands as the active species that enables a partially rate&#8208;limiting concerted C&#8722;H activation as part of a Pd0/PdII cycle.







Abstract
Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing&#8208;group&#8208;free C&#8722;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N&#8208;acyl amino acid and an N&#8208;heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled C&#8722;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of a Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;Ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>

A long&#8208;awaited challenging nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) with two bridging thiolates has been synthesized for the first time from the all&#8208;ferric thiolate iron&#8208;sulfur cubane cluster Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).







Abstract
Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] (2) [Tbt=2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S=0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibits two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 (1).

         <title>Stable Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Copper(II/I) Redox Mediators Bearing a Pentadentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, copper complexes bearing pentadentate ligands, namely [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ and [Cu(tme)]2+/+, have been reported as redox mediators in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Strikingly, devices based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices employing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart.







Abstract
In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, experiments revealed that ubiquitously used Lewis&#8208;base additives in the electrolytes coordinate to the CuII species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability. We report the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine&#8208;tripyridine pentadentate ligands, [Cu(tpe)]2+/+ (tpe=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]2+/+ (tme=N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tris(6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Experimental measurements demonstrate that the coordination environment of Cu(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart. DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]2+/+ complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 400&#8197;h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80&#8201;%) under identical conditions.

         <title>Enabling Clinical Technologies for Hyperpolarized 129Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of hyperpolarized 129Xe has the potential to revolutionize clinical imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing contrast of organ function complementary to that of CT imaging and conventional MRI. In this Review, the physics of spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) is discussed, production modalities of hyperpolarized 129Xe are explained, and biomedical applications to lung imaging and beyond are described.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization is a technique that can increase nuclear spin polarization with the corresponding gains in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by 4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude. When this process is applied to biologically relevant samples, the hyperpolarized molecules can be used as exogenous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. A technique called spin&#8208;exchange optical pumping (SEOP) can be applied to hyperpolarize noble gases such as 129Xe. Techniques based on hyperpolarized 129Xe are poised to revolutionize clinical lung imaging, offering a non&#8208;ionizing, high&#8208;contrast alternative to computed tomography (CT) imaging and conventional proton MRI. Moreover, CT and conventional proton MRI report on lung tissue structure but provide little functional information. On the other hand, when a subject breathes hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, functional lung images reporting on lung ventilation, perfusion and diffusion with 3D readout can be obtained in seconds. In this Review, the physics of SEOP is discussed and the different production modalities are explained in the context of their clinical application. We also briefly compare SEOP to other hyperpolarization methods and conclude this paper with the outlook for biomedical applications of hyperpolarized 129Xe to lung imaging and beyond.

A novel multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing polymer acceptor PFY&#8208;3Se with a narrow band gap, high electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction was developed. In all&#8208;polymer solar cells, batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch insensitive PFY&#8208;3Se obtained an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 15&#8201;% with high reproducibility, which is much better than its analogue, selenophene&#8208;free PFY&#8208;0Se (13.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) progressed tremendously due to recent advances in polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs), and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have exceeded 15&#8201;%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still restricted by a lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. A multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, PFY&#8208;3Se, was developed based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer. Compared to its thiophene analogue PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se shows a &#8776;30&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted absorption, increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular interaction. In all&#8208;PSCs, PFY&#8208;3Se achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1&#8201;% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs reported to date and much better than PFY&#8208;0Se (PCE=13.0&#8201;%). Notably, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties for realizing reproducible device performance, which is the first reported and also very rare for the PSMAs. Moreover, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs show low dependence of PCE on device area (0.045&#8211;1.0&#8197;cm2) and active layer thickness (110&#8211;250&#8197;nm), indicating the great potential toward practical applications.

         <title>Scaffold&#8208;Directed Face Selectivity Machine&#8208;Learned from Vectors of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning, ML, model based on vectors of transition&#8208;state interatomic contacts can predict face&#8208;selectivity of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions more accurately than traditional ML schemes, energetic calculations, or seasoned organic chemists.







Abstract
This work describes a method to vectorize and Machine&#8208;Learn, ML, non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for scaffold&#8208;directed reactions important in synthetic chemistry. Models trained on this representation predict correct face of approach in ca. 90&#8201;% of Michael additions or Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions. These accuracies are significantly higher than those based on traditional ML descriptors, energetic calculations, or intuition of experienced synthetic chemists. Our results also emphasize the importance of ML models being provided with relevant mechanistic knowledge; without such knowledge, these models cannot easily &#8220;transfer&#8208;learn&#8221; and extrapolate to previously unseen reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid aptamers were developed that are capable of covalently labeling their protein target with a functional molecule. Additionally, with little modification, the aptamer covalently crosslinked to its target instead, thereby inhibiting its function. Covalent aptamers offer a new tool for selective protein modification, detection, and inhibition.







Abstract
We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleotide sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanowire electrochemical biosensor for the quantitative measurement of the intravesicular glutamate (Glu) content inside living neurons and its released fractions was developed. It is shown that only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. The sensor opens new possibilities for exploring the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.







Abstract
Quantitative measurements of intravesicular glutamate (Glu) and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire that can selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (ca. 125&#8197;nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. These measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected.

         <title>Cucurbituril&#8208;Encapsulating Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Mechanochemistry: Adsorbents with Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry has been applied to achieve one&#8208;pot fabrication of monolithic decamethylcucurbit[5]uril (MC5)&#8208;encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced uptake, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This work opens up the novel possibility of designing task&#8208;specific porous host&#8211;guest hybrid materials on a macroscopic scale.







Abstract
The first examples of monolithic crystalline host&#8211;guest hybrid materials are described. The reaction of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and Fe(NO3)3&#8901;9&#8201;H2O in the presence of decamethylcucurbit[5]uril ammonium chloride (MC5&#8901;2&#8201;NH4Cl&#8901;4&#8201;H2O) directly affords MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid monoliths featuring hierarchical micro&#8208;, meso&#8208; and macropores. Particularly, this &#8220;bottle&#8208;around&#8208;ship&#8221; synthesis and one&#8208;pot shaping are facilitated by a newly discovered Fe&#8208;MC5 flowing gel formed by mechanochemistry. The designed MC5@MIL&#8208;100(Fe) hybrid material with MC5 as active domains shows enhanced CH4 and lead(II) uptake performance, and selective capture of lead(II) cations at low concentrations. This shows that host&#8211;guest hybrid materials can exhibit synergic properties that out&#8208;perform materials based on individual components.

         <title>Enhanced Band Convergence and Ultra&#8208;low Thermal Conductivity Synergistically Lead to High Thermoelectric Performance in SnTe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SnTe, a structural analogue of champion thermoelectric material PbTe, has recently attracted wide attention for thermoelectric energy conversion. Here, we have demonstrated a co&#8208;doping strategy to improve the thermoelectric performance of SnTe via simultaneous modulation of electronic structure and phonon transport. The electrical transport is optimized by 3 mol% Ag doping in self&#8208;compensated SnTe (i.e., Sn1.03Te). Further, Mg doping in SnAg0.03Te resulted in highly converged valence bands, which enhanced the Seebeck coefficient markedly. The energy gap between the light and heavy hole valence bands (DEv) decreases to 0.10 eV in Ag and Mg co&#8208;doped SnTe compared to the value of 0.35 eV in pristine SnTe. As a result of optimized p&#8208;type carrier concentration and highly converged valence bands, we obtained a high power factor of ~27 mW/cmK2 at 865 K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te. The lattice thermal conductivity of Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te reached to an ultra&#8208;low value of ~ 0.23 W/mK at 865 K due to the formation of MgTe nanoprecipitates in SnTe matrix. With this synergy among optimized carrier concentration, enhanced valence band convergence and ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity, we obtained a high thermoelectric figure of merit, zT ~1.55 at 865 K in Sn0.92Ag0.03Mg0.08Te.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Biology of Werner&#8217;s Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Werner&#8217;s Complex, as a cationic coordination complex (CCC), has hitherto unappreciated biological properties derived from its binding affinity to highly anionic biomolecules such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and nucleic acids. Competitive inhibitor and spectroscopic assays confirm the high affinity to GAGs heparin, heparan sulfate (HS) and its pentasaccharide mimetic Fondaparinux (FPX). Functional consequences of this affinity include inhibition of FPX cleavage by bacterial heparinase and mammalian heparanase enzymes with inhibition of cellular invasion and migration. Werner&#8217;s Complex is a very efficient condensing agent for DNA and tRNA. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for translational implications, it is demonstrated to display antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) at micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity. Exploitation of non&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonding and electrostatic interactions has motivated the unprecedented discovery of these properties, opening new avenues of research for this iconic compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocyclic and Dicyclic Dehydro[20]annulenes Integrated with Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral  ortho  &#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8208;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74 m  2  g  &#8208;1  . A moderate electron mobility of 0.05 cm  2  &#160;V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Reversal Polymer Nano&#8208;modulators for Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicine offers an effective way to regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We herein report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; while the later exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing its tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumor and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Concurrently, the released DMC inhibits PP2A activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Element Migration over Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Zeolite Catalysts and its Impact on Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of composite catalysts is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of each component, but also the proximity and interaction between them. Herein, we employ four representative oxides (In 2  O 3  , ZnO, Cr 2  O 3  , and ZrO 2  ) to combine with H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 for the hydrogenation of CO 2  to hydrocarbons directed by methanol intermediate and clarify the correlation between metal migration and the catalytic performance. The migration of metals to zeolite driven by the harsh reaction conditions can be visualized by electron microscopy, meanwhile, the change of zeolite acidity is also carefully characterized. The protonic sites of H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 are neutralized by mobile indium and zinc species via a solid ion&#8208;exchange mechanism, resulting in a drastic decrease of C 2+  hydrocarbon products over In 2  O 3  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZnO/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5. While, the thermomigration ability of chromium and zirconium species is not significant, endowing Cr 2  O 3  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and ZrO 2  /H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts with high selectivity of C 2+  hydrocarbons. This work preliminarily unveils the overlooked element migration and its profound impact on the catalytic behaviors of bifunctional catalysts for CO/CO 2  hydrogenation, providing insights into the rational design of emerging multifunctional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular protein&#8208;drug interactions probed by direct mass spectrometry of cell lysates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding protein&#8208;ligand interactions in a cellular context is an important goal in molecular biology and biochemistry, and particularly for drug development. Investigators must demonstrate that drugs penetrate cells and specifically bind their targets. Towards that end, we present a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells. This method is based on our previously introduced direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. Here, direct&#8208;MS enables label&#8208;free studies of protein&#8208;drug binding in human cells and is used to determine binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples. We anticipate that this method will enable the application of native MS to a range of problems where cellular context is important, including protein&#8208;protein interactions, drug uptake and binding, and characterization of therapeutic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;ion Binding Mediates the Reversible Interconversion of Cis and Trans Peroxido&#160;Dicopper Cores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu  2  O  2  ) featured in type III copper proteins (e.g. hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O  2  transport and substrate oxidation in a range of organisms.  &#956;  &#8208;1,2&#8208;  cis  peroxido dicopper cores (  C  P  ) have been proposed as key structures involved in the early stages of O  2  binding in these proteins, and their reversible isomerization to other Cu  2  O  2  cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic  C  P  cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of  C  P  Cu  2  O  2  species remain largely unexplored.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu  2  O  2  ) featured in type III copper proteins (e.g. hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O  2  transport and substrate oxidation in a range of organisms.  &#956;  -1,2-  cis  peroxido dicopper cores (  C  P  ) have been proposed as key structures involved in the early stages of O  2  binding in these proteins, and their reversible isomerization to other Cu  2  O  2  cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic  C  P  cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of  C  P  Cu  2  O  2  species remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report our combined synthetic, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies which detail the first reversible interconversion of&#160;  &#956;  -1,2-  trans  peroxido (  T  P  ) and  C  P  dicopper cores.

         <title>Aminocatalytic [8+2] Cycloadditions toward Chiral Cyclazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and exceptionally stereoselective synthesis toward chiral cycl[3.2.2]azines has been realized, by means of the rational design and utilization of novel (  E  )&#8208;3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;3  H  &#8208;pyrrolizines in iminium&#8208;ion catalyzed [8+2] cycloadditions. The presented protocol allows for the incorporation of diverse enals, including cinnamaldehydes, enolizable aldehydes, and substrates of extended conjugation. The obtained products contain both an electron&#8208;rich alkenyl&#8208;pyrrole moiety and an electron&#8208;deficient carbaldehyde substituent, and both moieties can undergo selective transformations with retention of the stereochemical information established in the [8+2] cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>The Cytochrome P450 Catalyzing C&#8722;S Bond Formation in S&#8208;Heterocyclization of Chuangxinmycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome P450 CxnD exhibited C&#8722;S bond forming activity in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis, generating the unique tricyclic indole&#8208;S&#8208;hetero scaffold from thiol intermediates. Structural characterization of CxnD with a substrate analogue proposed a radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate.







Abstract
Microbial sulfur&#8208;containing secondary metabolites show various biological activities, but the C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming in their biosynthetic metabolism has not been thoroughly understood. Here, we present genetic, biochemical and structural characterization of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CxnD exhibiting C&#8722;S bond forming activity in S&#8208;heterocyclization of chuangxinmycin biosynthesis. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that CxnD generated an indole&#8208;fused dihydrothiopyran skeleton from a L&#8208;Trp&#8208;derived thiol intermediate. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CxnD in complex with a substrate analogue and structure&#8208;based mutagenesis revealed intimate details of the substrate binding mode. A radical mechanism initiated by abstraction of the imino hydrogen atom or an electron from indole group of the substrate was proposed for CxnD, which provided valuable insights into the molecular basis for the intra&#8208;molecular C(sp2)&#8722;H thiolation by the P450 in chuangxinmycin biosynthesis.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of triplet dioxygen with closed shell molecules is formally spin&#8208;forbidden. Nature overcomes this prohibition by a variety of enzymes. The surprising reactivity of calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate with O2 is described and the spin&#8208;inversion process is analyzed. The square&#8208;planar aluminates transpire as enzyme models that substantiate the critical role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity and structural constraint for the functions of aerobic life.







Abstract
The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8722;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8211;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.

         <title>CeCl3/n&#8208;BuLi: Unraveling Imamoto's Organocerium Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seamless low&#8208;temperature syntheses, crystallization and spectroscopies provide structural details of the heterobimetallic reagent routinely used for regioselective carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions with carbonyl compounds. 7Li&#8197;NMR spectroscopy takes on an important role here, tracking down n&#8208;BuLi dissociation.







Abstract
CeCl3(thf) reacts at low temperatures with MeLi, t&#8208;BuLi, and n&#8208;BuLi to isolable organocerium complexes. Solvent&#8208;dependent extensive n&#8208;BuLi dissociation is revealed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy, suggesting &#8220;Ce(n&#8208;Bu)3(thf)x&#8221; or solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs like &#8220;[Li(thf)4][Ce(n&#8208;Bu)4(thf)y]&#8221; as as the dominant species of the Imamoto reagent. The stability of complexes Li3Ln(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 increases markedly with decreasing LnIII size. Closer inspection of the solution behavior of crystalline Li3Lu(n&#8208;Bu)6(thf)4 and mixtures of LuCl3(thf)2/n&#8208;BuLi in THF indicates occurring n&#8208;BuLi dissociation only at molar ratios of &lt;1:3. n&#8208;BuLi&#8208;depleted complex LiLu(n&#8208;Bu)3Cl(tmeda)2 was obtained by treatment of Li2Lu(n&#8208;Bu)5(tmeda)2 with ClSiMe3, at the expense of LiCl incorporation. Imamoto's ketone/tertiary alcohol transformation was examined with 1,3&#8208;diphenylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;one, affording 99&#8201;% of alcohol.

         <title>Small Exciton Binding Energies Enabling Direct Charge Photogeneration Towards Low&#8208;Driving&#8208;Force Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct photogeneration of free charge carriers enabled by remarkable low exciton binding energies is demonstrated in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptor of Y6 by a joint experimental and theoretical study. This results in efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets in the high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18&#8201;% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (Eb) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small Eb of &#8722;0.11&#8211;0.15&#8197;eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak Eb in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18&#8201;% efficiency for the single-junction devices based on the state-of-the-art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8722;0.11&#8211;0.15&#8197;eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA-based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilization of an Enantiopure Sub&#8208;monolayer of Helicene Radical Cations on a Au(111) Surface through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on noncovalent interactions has been developed to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chirality of the molecules being retained at the nanoscale.







Abstract
In the past few years, the chirality and magnetism of molecules have received notable interest for the development of novel molecular devices. Chiral helicenes combine both these properties, and thus their nanostructuration is the first step toward developing new multifunctional devices. Here, we present a novel strategy to deposit a sub&#8208;monolayer of enantiopure thia[4]helicene radical cations on a pre&#8208;functionalized Au(111) substrate. This approach results in both the paramagnetic character and the chemical structure of these molecules being maintained at the nanoscale, as demonstrated by in&#8208;house characterizations. Furthermore, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism confirmed that the handedness of the thia[4]helicene is preserved on the surface.

The high propensity for self&#8208;aggregation of phenalenyl rings and the introduction of bulky substituents into the appropriate positions led to the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional chain assembly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis indicated that the bond length alternation of the cumulene chain increased with decreasing temperature, along with improved overlapping of the phenalenyl rings. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that a localized spin pair within the molecule decouples at low temperatures and a continuum spin system involving intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular spin&#8211;spin interactions emerges in the one&#8208;dimensional chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Metal Battery Achieved by a Safe Electrolyte Based on Recyclable and Low&#8208;Cost Molecular Sieve</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;cost 3&#8197;&#197; zeolite was used to sieve the excess solvents within Li&#8208;ion solvation sheaths of typical carbonate electrolyte to eliminate the adverse effects (high&#8208;voltage/temperature oxidation, unstable CEI/SEI). As a result, high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal battery (LMB) that used this zeolite sieved electrolyte demonstrated a significantly improved cycling time and safety, but largely reduced production cost.







Abstract
As one typical clean&#8208;energy technologies, lithium&#8208;metal batteries, especially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries which use concentrated electrolytes hold promising prospect for the development of a sustainable world. However, concentrated electrolytes with aggregative configurations were achieved at the expense of using extra dose of costly and environmental&#8208;unfriendly salts/additives, which casts a shadow over the development of a sustainable world. Herein, without using any expensive salts/additives, we employed commercially&#8208;available low&#8208;cost and environmental&#8208;friendly molecular sieves (zeolite) to sieve the solvation sheath of lithium ions of classic commercialized electrolyte (LiPF6&#8208;EC/DMC), and resulting in a unique zeolite sieved electrolyte which was more aggregative than conventional concentrated electrolytes. Inspiringly, the new&#8208;designed electrolyte exhibited largely enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation stability under high&#8208;voltage (4.6&#8197;volts) and elevated temperature (55&#8201;&#176;C). NCM&#8208;811//Li cells assembled with this electrolyte delivered ultra&#8208;stable rechargeabilities (over 1000&#8197;cycles for half&#8208;cell; 300&#8197;cycles for pouch&#8208;cell). More importantly, sustainable NCM&#8208;811//Li pouch&#8208;cell with negligible capacity decay can also be obtained through using recyclable zeolite sieved electrolyte. This conceptually&#8208;new way in preparing safe and highly&#8208;efficient electrolyte by using low&#8208;price molecular sieve would accelerate the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion/lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

The sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) cathode favors solid&#8208;solid conversion mechanism in carbonate ester electrolytes but fails to pair high&#8208;capacity Li anode. Herein, we rationally designed a cation&#8208;solvent fully coordinated ether electrolyte to simultaneously resolve the problems of both Li anode and S@pPAN cathode.

         <title>Mechanochemical Reactivity of Bottlebrush and Dendronized Polymers: Solid vs Solution States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We explored the mechanochemical degradation of bottlebrush and dendronized polymers in solution (with ultrasonication, US) and solid states (with ball&#8208;mill grinding, BMG). Over 50 polymers were prepared with varying backbone length and arm architecture, composition, and size. With US, we found that bottlebrush and dendronized polymers exhibited consistent backbone scission behavior, which was related to their elongated conformations in solution. Considerably different behavior was observed with BMG, as arm architecture and composition had a significant impact on backbone scission rates. Arm scission was also observed for bottlebrush polymers in both solution and solid states, but only in the solid state for dendronized polymers. Motivated by these results, multi&#8208;mechanophore polymers with bottlebrush and dendronized polymer architectures were prepared and their reactivity was compared. Although dendronized polymers showed slower arm&#8208;scission, the selectivity for mechanophore activation was much higher. Overall, these results have important implications to the development of new mechanoresponsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dry reforming of CH4/CO2 by stable Ni nanocrystal on porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths at reduced temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of CH  4  /CO  2  provides a promising and economically feasible route for the large&#8208;scale carbon fixation; however, the coking and sintering of catalysts remain a fundamental challenge. Here we stabilize single&#8208;crystalline Ni nanoparticles at the surface of porous single&#8208;crystalline MgO monoliths and show the quantitative production of syngas from dry reforming of CH  4  /CO  2  . We show the complete conversion of CH  4  /CO  2  even only at 700&#176;C with excellent performance durability after a continuous operation of 500 hours. The well&#8208;defined and catalytically active Ni&#8208;MgO interfaces facilitate the reforming reaction and enhance the coking resistance. Our findings would enable an industrially and economically viable path for carbon reclamation, and the &#8220;Nanocrystal On Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Monoliths&#8221; technique could lead to stable catalyst designs for many challenging reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering competitive routes for Ni&#8208;based nanoparticle electrodeposition by an operando optical monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrodeposition of earth&#8208;abundant iron group metals such as nickel is difficult to characterize by simple electrochemical analyses as the reduction of their metal salts often competes with inhibiting reactions. This makes the mechanistic interpretation sometimes contradictory, preventing unambiguous predictions about the nature and structure of the electrodeposited material. Herein, the complexity of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) electrodeposition on indium tin oxide (ITO) is unravelled  operando  and at a single entity NP level by optical microscopy correlated to  ex situ  SEM imaging. Our correlative approach allows differentiating the dynamics of formation of two different NP populations, metallic Ni and Ni(OH)  2  with a &lt;25nm limit of detection (l.o.d.), their formation being ruled by the competition between Ni  2+  and water reduction. At the single NP level this results from a self&#8208;terminated growth, an information which is most often hidden in ensemble averaged measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbene Catalysis for the Synthesis of Aliphatic and &#945;&#8208;Amino Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis has gained attention recently for the synthesis of C&#8211;C bonds. Guided by density functional theory and mechanistic analyses, we report the tunability of these NHC single&#8208;electron operators. Computational and experimental results reveal that the reactivity of the key radical intermediate is substrate&#8208;dependent and can be modulated through steric and electronic parameters of the NHC. Catalyst tunability is harnessed in the visible&#8208;light driven generation of an acyl azolium radical species that undergoes selective coupling with various radical partners to afford diverse ketone products. This methodology is showcased in the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of amino acids and pharmaceutical compounds, highlighting the utility of these tunable single&#8208;electron NHC operators.</dc:description>

         <title>KIO4&#8208;mediated selective hydroxymethylation /methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes: a greener approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a KIO  4  &#8208;mediated, sustainable and chemoselective approach for the one&#8208;pot C3(  sp  2  )&#8208;H bond hydroxymethylation or methylenation of imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes with formaldehyde, generated  in situ  via the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol or glycerol (renewable reagents) through the Malaprade reaction. In the presence of ethylene glycol, a series of 3&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;imidazo&#8208;heteroarenes was obtained in good to excellent yields. These compounds are important intermediates to access pharmaceutical drugs,  e.g.,  Zolpidem. Furthermore, by using glycerol, bis(imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methane derivatives were selectively obtained in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Marriage of high throughput synthesis and high throughput protein crystallography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;ligand crystallography is widely used to drive advanced stages of drug optimization or to generate starting points for medicinal chemistry by fragment soaking. However, recent progress in protein crystallography could allow for a more integrated role of protein crystallography into the early drug discovery cycle. Here we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput crystallography. For this we describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to high diversity acrylamides and esters from diverse building blocks. Surprisingly, in the majority of acrylamides precipitation during the reaction was observed, making library synthesis on a mmol scale and a 96&#8208;well format particularly comfortable. The synthesis is also suitable for a high throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. Moreover, we exemplified the synthesis on a multigram scale featuring good yield and simple work&#8208;up. High throughput crystallography of our libraires yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID&#8208;19 causing agent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a time efficient manner. Our results demonstrate, that the marriage of  in situ  HT synthesis of (covalent) libraires and HT crystallography has the potential to accelerate hit finding and to provide meaningful strategies for medicinal chemistry projects.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;cleavable linkers for protein chemical synthesis through solid&#8208;phase ligations.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of long proteins requires the assembly of multiple fragments through successive ligations. The need for intermediate purifications is a strong limitation, as this generally leads to low to very low overall yields. An early&#8208;recognized solution to this problem is the assembly of the protein on a solid support, but no mature solid&#8208;supported chemical ligation (SPCL) technology has yet emerged. One of the main reasons lies in the difficulty to immobilize a first peptide segment on a SPCL&#8208;compatible solid support through a linker that can be cleaved under very mild conditions to release the assembled protein. A wide range of SPCL linkers have been developed but their cleavage requires chemical conditions sometimes incompatible with sensitive protein targets. Here, we describe the exploration of an alternative enzymatic approach in order to trigger cleavage under extremely mild and selective conditions. Optimization of the linker structure and use of a small enzyme able to diffuse into the solid support was a key for the success of the strategy. We demonstrated its utility by the native chemical ligation&#8208;based assembly of three peptide segments to afford a 15 kDa polypeptide.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Bulk Morphology in Efficient Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fine&#8208;tuning the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of photoactive materials, the morphology of donor:acceptor (D:A) photovoltaic films can be effectively adjusted. A large D:A ESP difference is required to assist charge generation, but too large ESP difference may result in additional nonradiative recombination loss and lead to hypermiscibility issues.







Abstract
Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a key role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thus determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. Herein, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. We show that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. Enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Fine&#8208;tuning the bulk morphology can give balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), neat or surface&#8208;modified with mesogenic motifs, transmit their inherent structural and morphological chirality to an achiral nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) elastic medium with a helical twisting power rivaling the most potent organic chiral dopants. The helical pitch, p, of the induced chiral N*&#8208;LC phase is tightened even when CNCs are decorated with achiral molecules bearing structural resemblance to the N&#8208;LC host.







Abstract
The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208;LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.

         <title>Atomic Sulfur Filling Oxygen Vacancies Optimizes H Absorption and Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>

Sulfur&#8208;atom doping of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 results in the occupation of the oxygen vacancies. S sites in the S&#8208;NiFe2O4 likely adsorb H adatoms and form S&#8208;H* in situ, which boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that the lowered energy barrier for H2O dissociation induced by S doping is the key reason for the remarkable HER performance.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) usually has sluggish kinetics in alkaline solution due to the difficulty in forming binding protons. Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (VO) of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (S&#8208;NiFe2O4) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61&#8197;mV at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 60&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;Acm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S&#8208;H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H2O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S&#8208;NiFe2O4.

         <title>Kinetic Microscale Thermophoresis for Simultaneous Measurement of Binding Affinity and Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13988-13995, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extension of microscale thermophoresis (MST) to perform temperature jumps by increasing the heat dissipation of the sample allows for quantification of binding affinities together with the kinetic rates. Relaxation kinetics for DNA hybridization were measured with high fidelity at different temperatures and various experimental conditions. The results shed light on the hybridization mechanism of DNA and confirmed determinants of DNA binding.







Abstract
Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a versatile technique to measure binding affinities of binder&#8211;ligand systems, based on the directional movement of molecules in a temperature gradient. We extended MST to measure binding kinetics as well as binding affinity in a single experiment by increasing the thermal dissipation of the sample. The kinetic relaxation fingerprints were derived from the fluorescence changes during thermodynamic re&#8208;equilibration of the sample after local heating. Using this method, we measured DNA hybridization on&#8208;rates and off&#8208;rates in the range 104&#8211;106&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 10&#8722;4&#8211;10&#8722;1&#8197;s&#8722;1, respectively. We observed the expected exponential dependence of the DNA hybridization off&#8208;rates on salt concentration, strand length and inverse temperature. The measured on&#8208;rates showed a linear dependence on salt concentration and weak dependence on strand length and temperature. For biomolecular interactions with large enthalpic contributions, the kinetic MST technique offers a robust, cost&#8208;effective and immobilization&#8208;free determination of kinetic rates and binding affinity simultaneously, even in crowded solutions.

Abstract
A dual modulation strategy of consecutive nucleation and confined growth of Li metal is proposed by using the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivative hollow capsule with inbuilt lithiophilic Au or Co&#8208;O nanoparticle (NP) seeds as heterogeneous host. The seeding&#8208;induced nucleation enables the negligible overpotential and promotes the inward injection of Li mass into the abundant cavities in host, followed by the conformal plating of Li on the outer surface of host during discharging. This modulation alleviates the dendrite growth and volume expansion of Li plating. The interconnected porous host network enables enhancement of cycling and rate performances of Li metal (a lifespan over 1200&#8197;h for Au&#8208;seeding symmetric cells, and an endurance of 220&#8197;cycles under an ultrahigh current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for corresponding asymmetric cells). The hollow capsules integrated with lithiophilic seeds solve the deformation problem of Li metal for durable and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsiveness from the Molecular to the Supramolecular Level via Platination of Pentacenes</title>

Single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems have been constructed on the basis of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes, which display high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency from the molecular to the supramolecular level.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsiveness is important for various applications. Currently, single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems are rare compared to systems that display two&#8208;photon absorption and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation processes. Supramolecular stacking of photo&#8208;responsive chromophores results in decreased efficiency due to space&#8208;confinement effects. Herein we show that &#963;&#8208;platination of pentacenes is a feasible protocol to build single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems, with advantages including a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, high photochemical efficiency, and pathway specificity. The pentacene&#8208;to&#8208;endoperoxidation transformation is accompanied by color and absorbance changes. The high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes facilitates NIR responsiveness in one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers, resulting in the disappearance of supramolecular chirality signals and disruption of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers. Overall, the &#963;&#8208;platination strategy opens up new avenues toward NIR photo&#8208;responsive materials at the molecular and supramolecular levels.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insights into C&#8722;S Bond Formation in Gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14188-14194, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of structural biology, mutagenesis, natural product isolation and activity assays provides insights into the formation of two carbon&#8722;sulfur bonds in the fungal virulence factor gliotoxin and related epipolythiodioxopiperazine natural products. The exceptional glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferase GliG uses an unusual bis&#8208;hydroxylated gliotoxin precursor and successively links two molecules of glutathione.







Abstract
Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulfur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulfurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8722;sulfur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified A. fumigatus strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8722;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.

Acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air&#8208;stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was attained with the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Reduced Arene Complexes of Hafnium Supported by a Triamidoamine Ligand</title>

A reduced anthracene complex of hafnium(IV) reacts with two equivalents of benzonitrile to form the hafnium&#8208;bis(iminyl) as the kinetic product that expulses one equivalent of benzonitrile to give an imido complex.







Abstract
A series of hafnium complexes with a reduced arene of the general formula [K(L)][Hf(Xy&#8208;N3N)(arene)] (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;, L=THF, 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; arene=C10H82&#8722;, C14H102&#8722;) mimic the chemistry of hafnium in its formal oxidation state +II. All compounds were obtained upon reduction of the chlorido complex [HfCl(Xy&#8208;N3N)(thf)] with two equivalents of potassium naphthalenide or anthracenide. The reducing nature and the basicity of the reduced anthracene ligand were explored in the reaction of benzonitrile and azobenzene, and by deprotonation of tert&#8208;butylacetylene, respectively. The reduction of benzonitrile provides an initial double nitrile insertion product under kinetic control that rearranges after extrusion of one of the inserted nitriles to a hafnium imido complex as the thermodynamic product. The reduction of azobenzene resulted in a diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex. Treatment of terminal alkynes with the anthracene or diphenylhydrazido(2&#8722;) complex led to the selective protonation of the corresponding dianionic ligand.

LACSer, a genetically encoded long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA fluorescence sensor, generates a specific fluorescence response to long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA, and can be used for the ratiometric quantification of long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA in cells and subcellular structures. The effects of ACSL and ACBP on the biosynthesis, transport, and downstream metabolism of long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA can be studied.







Abstract
Despite increasing awareness of the biological impacts of long&#8208;chain fatty acyl&#8208;CoA esters (LCACoAs), our knowledge about the subcellular distribution and regulatory functions of these acyl&#8208;CoA molecules is limited by a lack of methods for detecting LCACoAs in living cells. Here, we report development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor that enables ratiometric quantification of LCACoAs in living cells and subcellular compartments. We demonstrate how this FadR&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;LACSer sensor&#8221; undergoes LCACoA&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in easily detectable fluorescence responses, and show proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for real&#8208;time monitoring of LCACoAs in human cells. Subsequently, we applied LACSer in scientific studies investigating how disruption of ACSL enzymes differentially reduces cytosolic and mitochondrial LCACoA levels, and show how genetic disruption of an acyl&#8208;CoA binding protein (ACBP) alters mitochondrial accumulation of LCACoAs.

         <title>Tuneable Control of Organocatalytic Activity through Host&#8211;Guest Chemistry</title>

Binding an organocatalyst inside a cucurbituril molecular host can reversibly up&#8208; or downregulate catalytic activity, which is demonstrated in temporal control over the rate of a range of organocatalyzed transformations.







Abstract
Dynamic regulation of chemical reactivity is important in many complex chemical reaction networks, such as cascade reactions and signal transduction processes. Signal responsive catalysts could play a crucial role in regulating these reaction pathways. Recently, supramolecular encapsulation was reported to regulate the activities of artificial catalysts. We present a host&#8208;guest chemistry strategy to modulate the activity of commercially available synthetic organocatalysts. The molecular container cucurbit[7]uril was successfully applied to change the activity of four different organocatalysts and one initiator, enabling up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of the reaction rates of four different classes of chemical reactions. In most cases CB[7] encapsulation results in catalyst inhibition, however in one case catalyst activation by binding to CB[7] was observed. The mechanism behind this unexpected behavior was explored by NMR binding studies and pKa measurements. The catalytic activity can be instantaneously switched during operation, by addition of either supramolecular host or competitive binding molecules, and the reaction rate can be predicted with a kinetic model. Overall, this signal responsive system proves a promising tool to control catalytic activity.

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

TiO2@CaP nanosonosensitizer promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS). In an acidic tumor microenvironment, the CaP shell releases Ca2+ under ultrasound. The cascade process induces mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced immunogenic cell death to boost T cells recruitment and infiltration into the cold tumor, leading to regression of the primary tumor, non&#8208;treated distant tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis when in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy.







Abstract
Despite the promise of sonodynamic processes in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumors, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. We report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO2@CaP) that reinvigorates ROS generation and dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca2+ in an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO2@CaP acts as a smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca2+ ions to synergize with the sonodynamic process in the TME. TiO2@CaP substantially enhances immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T&#8208;cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO2@CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic antitumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work paves the way to development of &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizers with temporospatial control over antitumor responses.

&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin has dramatic consequences on the solution behaviour of molybdates. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis (SAXS) reveals the formation of large nanoscopic Mo&#8208;based oligomers that give rise to the fast formation of supramolecular core&#8211;shell type systems. This behaviour has been attributed to the chaotropic effect able to amplify very weak supramolecular interaction and then generates sophisticated non&#8208;covalent hierarchical assemblies.







Abstract
Herein, we show how the chaotropic effect arising from reduced molybdate ions in acidified aqueous solution is able to amplify drastically weak supramolecular interactions. Time&#8208;resolved Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis suggests that molybdenum&#8208;blue oligomeric species form huge aggregates in the presence of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CD) which results in the fast formation of nanoscopic {Mo154}&#8208;based host&#8208;guest species, while X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the ending&#8208;point of the scenario results in an unprecedented three&#8208;component well&#8208;ordered core&#8211;shell&#8208;like motif. A similar arrangement was found by using preformed hexarhenium chalcogenide&#8208;type cluster [Re6Te8(CN)6]4&#8722; as exogenous guest. This seminal work brings better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly processes in general and gives new opportunities for practical applications in the design of complex multicomponent materials via the simplicity of the non&#8208;covalent chemistry.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Crystalline Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Thin Films</title>

An unconventional ZIF&#8208;67 colloidal dispersion consisting of amorphous nanoparticles has been discovered, which was used as precursors to yield uniform films that deposited onto a number of substrates by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating approach, enabling fabrication of large&#8208;area ZIF&#8208;67 thin films with highly controlled thickness. This method can be extended to fabricate ZIF&#8208;8 thin film.







Abstract
We report that continuous MOF films with highly controlled thickness (from 44 to 5100&#8197;nm) can be deposited over length scales greater than 80&#8197;centimeters by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating method. Such success relies on our discovery of unprecedented perfectly dispersed colloidal solutions consisting of amorphous MOF nanoparticles, which we adopted as precursors that readily converted to the crystalline films upon low&#8208;temperature in situ heating. The colloidal solutions allow for the fabrication of compact and uniform MOF films on a great deal of substrates such as fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide, glass, SiO2, Al2O3, Si, Cu, and even flexible polycarbonate, widening their technological applications where substrates are essential. Despite the present work focuses on the fabrication of uniform cobalt&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 and zinc&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 films, our findings mark a great possibility in producing other high&#8208;quality MOF thin films on a large scale.

Despite the present work focuses on the fabrication of uniform cobalt-(2-methylimidazole)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and zinc-(2-methylimidazole)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films, our findings mark a great possibility in producing other high-quality MOF thin films on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Coating the Right Polymer: Achieving Ideal Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Particle Dispersibility in Polymer Matrixes Using a Coordinative Crosslinking Surface Modification Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14138-14145, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new general method for the coating of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with a uniform layer of polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, or polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1) is reported. By matching the surface polymer with the matrix polymer, ideal dispersibility of MOF particles in various polymer matrices can thus be achieved.







Abstract
This work describes the first generalizable method to modify various metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1). The method first utilizes electrostatic adsorption to rapidly decorate positively charged MOF surfaces with a layer of negatively charged metal&#8208;organic nanocapsule, PgC5Cu. After mixing with the polymer, the copper open metal sites on PgC5Cu can coordinatively crosslink the polar functional groups on the surface polymer upon thermal activation thereby resulting in the immobilization of a uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm polymer coating. We quantitatively analyzed the distribution of free path spacing between MOF particles and demonstrated that when the surface polymer matches the matrix polymer, the MOF dispersion was not only visually improved but also found to align perfectly with a theoretically predicted ideal dispersion model where no aggregation driving force was present.

         <title>Macroscopic Ultralight Aerogel Monoliths of Imine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

A three&#8208;step method produces COF aerogel monoliths, based on sol&#8211;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying. 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The aerogels have extremely low densities, high porosity, and mechanically behave as elastic or plastic materials under different strain. They show excellent absorption capacity with high removal efficiency.







Abstract
The use of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in practical applications demands shaping them into macroscopic objects, which remains challenging. Herein, we report a simple three&#8208;step method to produce COF aerogels, based on sol&#8208;gel transition, solvent&#8208;exchange, and supercritical CO2 drying, in which 2D imine&#8208;based COF sheets link together to form hierarchical porous structures. The resultant COF aerogel monoliths have extremely low densities (ca. 0.02&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3), high porosity (total porosity values of ca. 99&#8201;%), and mechanically behave as elastic materials under a moderate strain (&lt;25&#8211;35&#8201;%) but become plastic under greater strain. Moreover, these COF aerogels maintain the micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porosity of their constituent COFs, and show excellent absorption capacity (e.g. toluene uptake: 32&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1), with high removal efficiency (ca. 99&#8201;%). The same three&#8208;step method can be used to create functional composites of these COF aerogels with nanomaterials.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Palladium(II) Barrel for Binding of Fullerenes and Photosensitization Ability of the Fullerene&#8208;Encapsulated Barrel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14109-14116, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;based tetra&#8208;imidazole ligand and a PdII acceptor were employed to construct a trifacial molecular barrel (1), which acts as an efficient host for fullerenes. The barrel has better binding affinity towards C70 over C60 and predominantly encapsulates C70 from a mixture of C60/C70. In the presence of visible light, C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 show efficient photosensitizing ability for 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Fullerene extracts obtained from fullerene soot lack their real application due to their poor solubility in common solvents and difficulty in purification. Encapsulation of these extracts in a suitable host is an important approach to address these issues. We present a new Pd6 barrel (1), which is composed of three 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole panels, clipped through six cis&#8208;PdII acceptors. Large open windows and cavity make it an efficient host for a large guest. Favorable interactions between the ligand and fullerene (C60 and C70) allows the barrel to encapsulate fullerene efficiently. Thorough investigation reveals that barrel 1 has a stronger binding affinity towards C70 over C60, resulting in the predominant extraction of C70 from a mixture of the two. Finally, the fullerene encapsulated barrels C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 were found to be efficient for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced singlet oxygen generation. Such preferential binding of C70 and photosensitizing ability of C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 are noteworthy.

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Using a Hybrid Hypercrosslinked Polymer**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13978-13987, June 14, 2021. </description>

A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer was prepared that is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous encapsulation strategy.







Abstract
In this work, an organic/inorganic hybrid polymer containing siloxyl functional groups was synthesized and applied to encapsulate phase change materials (PCMs). Owing to the mild conditions of the hypercrosslinking reaction, which only requires the addition of a catalytic amount of aqueous alkaline solution, both organic and inorganic PCMs are tolerated. It is noteworthy that the initial homogeneous state of the reaction mixture allowed the ultimate encapsulation rate of the PCMs and the uniform blending of the third nano&#8208;additives with the aim of thermal conductivity enhancement. Further study reveals that the presence of this hybrid hydrophobic polymer in a phase change composite endows the latter with a unique self&#8208;cleaning property. This novel PCM encapsulation protocol is suitable for nanoparticles including carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles, and inorganic oxide nanoparticles. A thermal conductivity enhancement of 600&#8201;% was achieved along with 93.7&#8201;% light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency with a latent heat of 180&#8197;J&#8201;g&#8722;1 without leakage.

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

A dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom dispersed catalyst of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 has been established for enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Operando XANES combined with DFT calculation demonstrate that the Cu&#8722;N4 sites as active center experience the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turn to single&#8208;atom state again after reaction.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8722;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an Eonset of 0.98&#8197;V and an E1/2 of 0.83&#8197;V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8722;N4 as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type Oxidation of Olefins at Room Temperature with 1,3&#8208;Diketones or Neocuproine as Ligands**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Various iron catalyst systems featuring a range of different ligands have been evaluated for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins to ketones in the presence of phenylsilane at room temperature and ambient air. The transformation is operationally simple, sustainable, exhibits a high functional group tolerance, and is applicable to natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the oxidation of olefins to ketones using either tris(dibenzoylmethanato)iron(III) [Fe(dbm)3] or a combination of iron(II) chloride and neocuproine (2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) as catalysts and phenylsilane (PhSiH3) as additive. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature using air as sole oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, is operationally simple, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and shows a high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ketones are formed smoothly in up to 97&#8201;% yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity, while the corresponding alcohols were observed as by&#8208;products. Labeling experiments showed that an incorporated hydrogen atom originates from the phenylsilane. The oxygen atom of the ketone as well as of the alcohol derives from the ambient atmosphere.

         <title>Dual Gate&#8208;Controlled Therapeutics for Overcoming Bacterium&#8208;Induced Drug Resistance and Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

pH/enzyme&#8208;responsive nanoreservoirs are co&#8208;loaded with anticancer drugs and antibiotics for overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance. They can effectively inhibit tumor growth and remarkably activate the immune system in the presence of bacteria. This work presents a safe and efficacious method to reverse bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and convert the intratumoral bacteria from foes to friends for cancer therapy.







Abstract
The presence of bacteria in the tumor can cause cancer resistance to chemotherapeutics. To fight against bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance, herein we design self&#8208;traceable nanoreservoirs that are simultaneously loaded with gemcitabine (an anticancer drug) and ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) and are decorated with hyaluronic acid for active tumor targeting. The nanoreservoirs have a pH&#8208;sensitive gate and an enzyme&#8208;responsive gate that can be opened in the acidic and hyaluronidase&#8208;abundant tumor microenvironment to control drug release rates. Moreover, the nanoreservoirs can specifically target the tumor regions without eliciting evident toxicity to normal tissues, kill the intratumoral bacteria, and inhibit the tumor growth even in the presence of the bacteria. Unexpectedly, the nanoreservoirs can activate T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses through promoting antigen&#8208;presenting dendritic cell maturation and depleting immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells in bacterium&#8208;infected tumors.

         <title>Efficient Nitrogen Fixation to Ammonia through Integration of Plasma Oxidation with Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14131-14137, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step process, serially integrating non&#8208;thermal plasma technique for facile N2 to NOx&#8722; and electrocatalytic reduction for highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3, is presented. A surface boron&#8208;rich nickel boride electrocatalyst was developed to boost the activity, selectivity, and stability for nitrate reduction to NH3 with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and low overpotential.







Abstract
Present one&#8208;step N2 fixation is impeded by tough activation of the N&#8801;N bond and low selectivity to NH3. Here we report fixation of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 can be decoupled to a two&#8208;step process with one problem effectively solved in each step, including: 1)&#8197;facile activation of N2 to NOx&#8722; by a non&#8208;thermal plasma technique, and 2)&#8197;highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3 by electrocatalytic reduction. Importantly, this process uses air and water as low&#8208;cost raw materials for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions. For NOx&#8722; reduction to NH3, we present a surface boron&#8208;rich core&#8211;shell nickel boride electrocatalyst. The surface boron&#8208;rich feature is the key to boosting activity, selectivity, and stability via enhanced NOx&#8722; adsorption, and suppression of hydrogen evolution and surface Ni oxidation. A significant ammonia production of 198.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, together with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Alcohol Dehydrogenases and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Gold(I) Catalysts: Design of a Chemoenzymatic Cascade towards Optically Active &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13945-13951, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concurrent process involving a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (IPrAuNTf2) and an alcohol dehydrogenase is described for the first time. This cascade approach allows the development of a Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement for the transformation of racemic propargylic alcohols, mostly with good selectivities towards the corresponding E&#8208;allylic ketone intermediates, in aqueous medium, which are subsequently reduced to obtain the desired alcohol enantiomers with excellent optical purities.







Abstract
The combination of gold(I) and enzyme catalysis is used in a two&#8208;step approach, including Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement of a series of readily available propargylic alcohols followed by stereoselective bioreduction of the corresponding allylic ketone intermediates, to provide optically pure &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted allylic alcohols. This cascade involves a gold N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and an enzyme, demonstrating the compatibility of both catalyst types in aqueous medium under mild reaction conditions. The combination of [1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)&#8208;imide]gold(I) (IPrAuNTf2) and a selective alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH&#8208;A from Rhodococcus&#8197;ruber, KRED&#8208;P1&#8208;A12 or KRED&#8208;P3&#8208;G09) led to the synthesis of a series of optically active (E)&#8208;4&#8208;arylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ols in good yields (65&#8211;86&#8201;%). The approach was also extended to various 2&#8208;hetarylpent&#8208;3&#8208;yn&#8208;2&#8208;ol, hexynol, and butynol derivatives. The use of alcohol dehydrogenases of opposite selectivity led to the production of both allyl alcohol enantiomers (93&#8208;&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) for a broad panel of substrates.

         <title>Rational Design of Multicolor&#8208;Emitting Chiral Carbonized Polymer Dots for Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

The synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) is reported for the first time. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs is between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Furthermore, these Ch&#8208;CPDs were combined with chiral gels through supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby yielding their multicolor and white circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting chiral carbonized polymer dots (Ch&#8208;CPDs) are attracting great interest because of their extraordinary photonic properties, but modulating their band&#8208;gap emission, especially at long wavelength, and maintaining their chiral structure to achieve multicolor, high&#8208;emission Ch&#8208;CPDs remains challenging. Reported here for the first time is the synthesis of red&#8208; and multicolor&#8208;emitting Ch&#8208;CPDs using the common precursors L&#8208;/D&#8208;tryptophan and o&#8208;phenylenediamine, and a solvothermal approach at one temperature. The quantum yield of the Ch&#8208;CPDs was between 31&#8201;% and 54&#8201;%. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provided multicolor&#8208;emitting Ch&#8208;CPDs showing novel circularly polarized luminescence, with the highest dissymmetric factor (glum) of 1&#215;10&#8722;2. Importantly, circularly polarized white&#8208;emitting CPDs were fabricated for the first time by tuning the mixing ratio of the three colored Ch&#8208;CPDs in a gel. This strategy affords exciting opportunities for designing functional chiroptical materials.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14068-14075, June 14, 2021. </description>

A strategy is presented for nickel&#8208; catalyzed asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides react to produce oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Notably, synthesis of a range of bioactive pyrroloindolines was achieved.







Abstract
Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO2 is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO2 fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. There are only a few reports and no examples of alkenes via transition metal catalysis. We report the first asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 via nickel catalysis. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides, such as aryl bromides, aryl triflates and inert aryl chlorides of particular note, undergo the reaction smoothly to give important oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. This transformation features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, facile scalability, good to excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The method highlights the formal synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Esermethole, (&#8722;)&#8208;Physostigmine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Physovenine, and the total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Debromoflustramide&#8197;B, (&#8722;)&#8208;Debromoflustramine&#8197;B and (+)&#8208;Coixspirolactam&#8197;A; thereby, opening an avenue for the total synthesis of chiral natural products with CO2.

         <title>Generating Assembled MFI Nanocrystals with Reduced b&#8208;Axis through Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Exchange Induced Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13959-13968, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned plate&#8208;shaped MFI crystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness were synthesized through homogeneous nucleation followed by structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) exchange induced recrystallization, using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The obtained materials markedly exaggerated propene selectivity and showed prolonged catalyst lifetime in the conversion of dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
Controlling crystal size and shape of zeolitic materials is an effective way to promote their mass transport and catalytic properties. Herein, we report a single step, Na+&#8208; and porogen&#8208; free crystallization of MFI hierarchical architecture made up of aligned nanocrystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness (5&#8211;23&#8197;nm) and adjustable Si/Al ratios between 35 to 120, employing the commonly used tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Homogeneous nucleation driven by both SDAs and subsequent SDA&#8208;exchange induced dissolution&#8208;recrystallization are responsible for the formation of such structure. The enhanced textural and diffusion properties account for a notable exaggeration of propene selectivity and catalyst lifetime in dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (DTO) conversion. This protocol is extendable to the rational synthesis of other hierarchical zeolites through crystallization process control.

Ionic liquids boost the LiTFSI solubility in water from 21 to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Excess lithium salt solubility arises from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. This approach improves particularly the reductive stability of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes, enabling stable cycling of commercially relevant LTO/NMC811 full cells.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#8197;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in water to up to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.

         <title>Effect of the Ligand Backbone on the Reactivity and Mechanistic Paradigm of Non&#8208;Heme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo during Olefin Epoxidation</title>

The steric and electronic effects exerted by the bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) in the non&#8208;heme complex [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ play a key role in olefin epoxidation by oxygen atom transfer and trigger mechanistic diversification. In the present study, the mechanism of olefin epoxidation was thoroughly investigated and rationalized with a detailed computational study.







Abstract
The oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity of the non&#8208;heme [FeIV(2PyN2Q)(O)]2+ (2) containing the sterically bulky quinoline&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand (2PyN2Q) has been thoroughly studied with different olefins. The ferryl&#8208;oxo complex 2 shows excellent OAT reactivity during epoxidations. The steric encumbrance and electronic effect of the ligand influence the mechanistic shuttle between OAT pathway I and isomerization pathway II (during the reaction stereo pure olefins), resulting in a mixture of cis&#8208;trans epoxide products. In contrast, the sterically less hindered and electronically different [FeIV(N4Py)(O)]2+ (1) provides only cis&#8208;stilbene epoxide. A Hammett study suggests the role of dominant inductive electronic along with minor resonance effect during electron transfer from olefin to 2 in the rate&#8208;limiting step. Additionally, a computational study supports the involvement of stepwise pathways during olefin epoxidation. The ferryl bend due to the bulkier ligand incorporation leads to destabilization of both 
 and 
 orbitals, leading to a very small quintet&#8211;triplet gap and enhanced reactivity for 2 compared to 1. Thus, the present study unveils the role of steric and electronic effects of the ligand towards mechanistic modification during olefin epoxidation

         <title>Cooperation between a T&#8197;Domain and a Minimal C&#8208;Terminal Docking Domain to Enable Specific Assembly in a Multiprotein NRPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 14171-14178, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between two non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) proteins mediates the biosynthesis of PAX peptides and involves an extended docking interface, where a part of the thiolation (T) domain and a minimal C&#8208;terminal docking domain (CDD) cooperate to bind to the N&#8208;terminal docking domain (NDD) with nanomolar affinity&#8212;the highest docking domain affinity yet observed in such megasynthases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products from amino acid building blocks. They often consist of multiple polypeptide chains which assemble in a specific linear order via specialized N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal docking domains (N/CDDs). Typically, docking domains function independently from other domains in NRPS assembly. Thus, docking domain replacements enable the assembly of &#8220;designer&#8221; NRPS from proteins that normally do not interact. The multiprotein &#8220;peptide&#8208;antimicrobial&#8208;Xenorhabdus&#8221; (PAX) peptide&#8208;producing PaxS NRPS is assembled from the three proteins PaxA, PaxB and PaxC. Herein, we show that the small CDD of PaxA cooperates with its preceding thiolation (T1) domain to bind the NDD of PaxB with very high affinity, establishing a structural and thermodynamical basis for this unprecedented docking interaction, and we test its functional importance in vivo in a truncated PaxS assembly line. Similar docking interactions are apparently present in other NRPS systems.

         <title>Catalytic Oxygenation of Hydrocarbons by Mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo Dicopper(II) Species Resulting from O&#8722;O Cleavage of Tetranuclear CuI/CuII Peroxo Complexes</title>

UV/Vis and rRaman spectroscopies complemented by XAS and UHR&#8208;ESI mass spectrometry are employed to monitor the binding of O2 in a tetranuclear copper cluster, followed by homolytic O&#8722;O bond cleavage. The resulting mono&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo dicopper(II) complexes catalytically oxygenate a variety of hydrocarbons, establishing an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the monooxygenation of organic substrates from gaseous O2.







Abstract
One of the challenges of catalysis is the transformation of inert C&#8722;H bonds to useful products. Copper&#8208;containing monooxygenases play an important role in this regard. Here we show that low&#8208;temperature oxygenation of dinuclear copper(I) complexes leads to unusual tetranuclear, mixed&#8208;valent &#956;4&#8208;peroxo [CuI/CuII]2 complexes. These Cu4O2 intermediates promote irreversible and thermally activated O&#8722;O bond homolysis, generating Cu2O complexes that catalyze strongly exergonic H&#8208;atom abstraction from hydrocarbons, coupled to O&#8208;transfer. The Cu2O species can also be produced with N2O, demonstrating their capability for small&#8208;molecule activation. The binding and cleavage of O2 leading to the primary Cu4O2 intermediate and the Cu2O complexes, respectively, is elucidated with a range of solution spectroscopic methods and mass spectrometry. The unique reactivities of these species establish an unprecedented, 100&#8201;% atom&#8208;economic scenario for the catalytic, copper&#8208;mediated monooxygenation of organic substrates, employing both O&#8208;atoms of O2.

By restricting polymerization in the native pores of pre&#8208;packed undercooled particles, organometallic adducts were autonomously generated on either flat&#8208; or pre&#8208;textured particle beds. These adducts&#8217; fine structures successfully turned the Wenzel wetting state of metal rose into the Cassie state of composite lotus.







Abstract
Fabrication of tunable fine textures on solid metal surfaces often demands sophisticated reaction/processing systems. By exploiting in&#8197;situ polymerization and self&#8208;assembly of inorganic adducts derived from liquid metals (the so&#8208;called HetMet reaction) with concomitant solidification, solid metal films with tunable texture are readily fabricated. Serving as a natural dimensional confinement, interparticle pores and capillary&#8208;adhered thin liquid films in a pre&#8208;packed bed of undercooled liquid metal particles lead to the expeditious surface accumulation of organometallic synthons, which readily oligomerize and self&#8208;assemble into concentration&#8208;dictated morphologies/patterns. Tuning particle size, particle packing (flat or textured), and reactant concentration generates diverse, autonomously organized organometallic structures on a metal particle bed. Concomitant solidification and sintering of the underlying undercooled particle bed led to a multiscale patterned solid metal surface. The process is illustrated by creating tunable features on pre&#8208;organized metal particle beds with concomitant tunable wettability as illustrated through the so&#8208;called petal and lotus effects.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Pairing Approach to Stereoselective Metal&#8208;Free Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13952-13958, June 14, 2021. </description>

Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization is achieved by non&#8208;covalent interactions, such as ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics and solvation effects, in a metal&#8208;free condition.







Abstract
Stereochemistry can have a profound impact on polymer and materials properties. Unfortunately, straightforward methods for realizing high levels of stereocontrolled polymerizations are often challenging to achieve. In a departure from traditional metal&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), we discovered a remarkably simple method for controlling alkene stereochemistry in photoredox mediated metal&#8208;free ROMP. Ion&#8208;pairing, initiator sterics, and solvation effects each had profound impact on the stereochemistry of polynorbornene (PNB). Simple modifications to the reaction conditions produced PNB with trans alkene content of 25 to &gt;98&#8201;%. High cis content was obtained from relatively larger counterions, toluene as solvent, low temperatures (&#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C), and initiators with low Charton values. Conversely, smaller counterions, dichloromethane as solvent, and enol ethers with higher Charton values enabled production of PNB with high trans content. Data from a combined experimental and computational investigation are consistent with the stereocontrolling step of the radical cationic mechanism proceeding under thermodynamic control.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of a Structurally Dynamic Antibacterial Diterpenoid</title>

We report the isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold. The absolute configurations and antibacterial activities of benditerpenoic acid and the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene core were established.







Abstract
A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this Streptomyces strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher's analysis, J&#8208;based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR&#8208;derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring&#8208;flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of &#8776;16&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including methicillin and multi&#8208;drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is a rare example of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheet Mimetics that Target the Transcriptional Coactivator &#946;&#8208;Catenin and Inhibit Wnt Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13937-13944, June 14, 2021. </description>

Starting from a 52 amino acid protein binding epitope, a bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin structure was developed to bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. Our structure&#8208;based design approach was supported by screening a focused library of bicyclic mimetics which was generated via late&#8208;stage diversification. The most active bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin shows cell&#8208;penetration and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.

         <title>Cover Picture: Local Deuteration Enables NMR Observation of Methyl Groups in Proteins from Eukaryotic and Cell&#8208;Free Expression Systems (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 25/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13685-13685, June 14, 2021. </description>

Methyl&#8208;group NMR spectroscopy offers exceptional benefits for structural studies of complex biological systems. Yet, restrictive isotope labeling requirements have obstructed its use in emerging protein expression systems. In their Communication on page&#8197;13783, Manuel Etzkorn, Vladimir Gelev, Haribabu Arthanari, and co&#8208;workers report a five&#8208;step synthesis of stereoselectively methyl&#8208;labeled leucine, which greatly facilitates applications in eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems, providing desirable NMR sensors in so far inaccessible protein systems.

Bicyclic peptidomimetics bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. A structure&#8208;based design strategy has been applied to minimize a 52 amino acid binding motif into bicyclic 16&#8208;mer &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics. The biologically most active mimetic exhibits robust cellular uptake and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay, as reported by Tom&#8197;N. Grossmann and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;13937.

A hybrid hypercrosslinked polymer is reported by Changhui Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;13978. It is capable of encapsulating both organic and inorganic phase change materials via a novel homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous encapsulation strategy with the aim to meet the demand for highly efficient thermal energy storage.

         <dc:description>
Zeolite catalysts often display highly intergrown structures, yielding a zeolite &#8220;flower&#8221; or &#8220;sun&#8221; at the microscale. Using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in&#8197;situ fluorescence microscopy, Bert&#8197;M. Weckhuysen et&#8197;al. show in their Communication on page&#8197;13803 that porosity is developed only in specific segments of zeolites, which might cause strong local discrepancies in performance and deactivation behavior. The yellow sun against a black background is reminiscent of the symbol of Utrecht University, where the work was performed.

         <title>Contemporary Approaches for Site&#8208;Selective Dual Functionalization of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13757-13777, June 14, 2021. </description>

Site&#8208;selective dual protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates. The methodologies, as well as the applications of dual&#8208;functionalized protein bioconjugates are highlighted in this review.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective protein functionalization serves as an invaluable tool for investigating protein structures and functions in complicated cellular environments and accomplishing semi&#8208;synthetic protein conjugates such as traceable therapeutics with improved features. Dual functionalization of proteins allows the incorporation of two different types of functionalities at distinct location(s), which greatly expands the features of native proteins. The attachment and crosstalk of a fluorescence donor and an acceptor dye provides fundamental insights into the folding and structural changes of proteins upon ligand binding in their native cellular environments. Moreover, the combination of drug molecules with different modes of action, imaging agents or stabilizing polymers provides new avenues to design precision protein therapeutics in a reproducible and well&#8208;characterizable fashion. This review aims to give a timely overview of the recent advancements and a future perspective of this relatively new research area. First, the chemical toolbox for dual functionalization of proteins is discussed and compared. The strengths and limitations of each strategy are summarized in order to enable readers to select the most appropriate method for their envisaged applications. Thereafter, representative applications of these dual&#8208;modified protein bioconjugates benefiting from the synergistic/additive properties of the two synthetic moieties are highlighted.

         <title>Revealing the Similarities of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Iminiums and Acylazoliums in Organocatalysis</title>

Made for each other! Striking similarity in reactivity has been observed for organocatalytically generated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums towards various nucleophiles. Analogous [3+3] and [3+2] annulations, cascade reactions, and Michael additions of these highly electrophilic intermediates are highlighted in this Minireview.







Abstract
The secondary amine&#8208;catalyzed reactions proceeding via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed transformations taking place via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazoliums are the two widely used electrophilic intermediates in organocatalysis. Over the last two decades, these two intermediates are extensively utilized for the enantioselective construction of valuable molecules. Both intermediates are generated by the covalent binding of catalysts to the substrates leading to LUMO activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls. A variety of soft nucleophiles are known to add to the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums in a conjugate fashion, and in many cases, striking similarity in reactivity has been observed. Having said this, there are few cases where these intermediates exhibit difference in reactivity. This Minireview is aimed at highlighting the resemblances in reactivity between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated iminiums and acylazoliums thereby shedding light on the unnoticed parallels of the two intermediates in organocatalysis.

         <title>Nitro and Other Electron Withdrawing Group Activated Ruthenium Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis Reactions</title>

Chelating&#8208;benzylidene ruthenium complexes (so&#8208;called Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalysts) activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs) are finding practical applications in target&#8208;oriented synthesis, medicinal chemistry, the preparation of fine&#8208;chemicals, and in materials chemistry.







Abstract
Advanced applications of the Nobel Prize winning olefin metathesis reaction require user&#8208;friendly and highly universal catalysts. From many successful metathesis catalysts, which belong to the two distinct classes of Schrock and Grubbs&#8208;type catalysts, the subclass of chelating&#8208;benzylidene ruthenium complexes (so&#8208;called Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs catalysts) additionally activated by electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs) provides a highly tunable platform. In the Review, the origin of the EWG&#8208;activation concept and selected applications of the resulting catalysts in target&#8208;oriented synthesis, medicinal chemistry, as well as in the preparation of fine&#8208;chemicals and in materials chemistry is discussed. Based on the examples, some suggestions for end&#8208;users regarding minimization of catalyst loading, selectivity control, and general optimization of the olefin metathesis reaction are provided.

Polymer networks cross&#8208;linked through bonds capable of exchanging with one another have a high potential for increasing the sustainability of polymeric materials. However, the adaptive and responsive properties of these networks can also enhance the properties of electroactive polymers in smart and functional devices. This Minireview highlights recent work at this emerging research boundary and discusses future directions for dynamic polymer networks in soft machine applications.







Abstract
While the fascinating field of soft machines has grown rapidly over the last two decades, the materials they are constructed from have remained largely unchanged during this time. Parallel activities have led to significant advances in the field of dynamic polymer networks, leading to the design of three&#8208;dimensionally cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials that are able to adapt and transform through stimuli&#8208;induced bond exchange. Recent work has begun to merge these two fields of research by incorporating the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of dynamic polymer networks into soft machine components. These include dielectric elastomers, stretchable electrodes, nanogenerators, and energy storage devices. In this Minireview, we outline recent progress made in this emerging research area and discuss future directions for the field.

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13788-13792, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to syngas mediated by single Rh atom&#8208;doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO2&#8722;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the COads from RhTiO2CO&#8722;.







Abstract
Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H2+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722; promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of COads from the RhTiO2CO&#8722; to reform RhTiO2&#8722;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.

     alt="Catalytic Co-Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic co-conversion of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to syngas mediated by single Rh atom-doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+CO and an adsorbed CO (CO&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the CO&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; from RhTiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic co-conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; promotes the co-conversion of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to free 2&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+CO and an adsorbed CO (CO&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; from the RhTiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to reform RhTiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Ultralow Temperature Aqueous Battery with Proton Chemistry</title>

An aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on H+ coordination/un&#8208;coordination behavior was developed in anti&#8208;freezing H2SO4 solution. The batteries can work well even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C due to the fast H+ diffusion kinetics and high ionic conductivity of electrolyte.







Abstract
Conventional aqueous batteries usually suffer from serious capacity loss under subzero conditions owing to the freeze of electrolytes. To realize the utilization of aqueous batteries in extremely cold climates, low&#8208;temperature aqueous battery systems have to be developed. Herein, an aqueous Pb&#8208;quinone battery based on p&#8208;chloranil/reduced graphene oxide (PCHL&#8208;rGO) in H2SO4 electrolyte is developed. Such aqueous Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries display H+ insertion chemistry, which endows the batteries with fast reaction kinetics and high rate capability. In addition, the hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be significantly damaged in electrolyte by modulating the interaction between SO42&#8722; and water molecules, lowering the freezing point of electrolyte. As a result, the Pb/PCHL&#8208;rGO batteries deliver extraordinary electrochemical performance even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C. This work will broaden the horizons of aqueous batteries and open up new opportunities to construct low&#8208;temperature aqueous batteries.

         <title>Silylated Sulfuric Acid: Preparation of a Tris(trimethylsilyl)oxosulfonium [(Me3Si&#8722;O)3SO]+ Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13798-13802, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;larger&#8221; analog of protonated sulfuric acid, [H3SO4]+, the silylated oxosulfonium ion, [(Me3Si)3SO4]+, was obtained in the reaction of silylated sulfuric acid with a [Me3Si]+ transfer reagent such as [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3]+[wca]&#8722;, when a weakly coordinating anion ([wca]&#8722;) is used as counterion.







Abstract
The chemistry of silylated sulfuric acid, O2S(OSiMe3)2 (T2SO4, T=Me3Si; also known as bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfate), has been studied in detail with the aim of synthesizing the formal autosilylation products of silylated sulfuric acid, [T3SO4]+ and [TSO4]&#8722;, in analogy to the known protonated species, [H3SO4]+ and [HSO4]&#8722;. The synthesis of the [TSO4]&#8722; ion only succeeds when a base, such as OPMe3 that forms a weakly coordinating cation upon silylation, is reacted with T2SO4, resulting in the formation of [Me3POT]+[TSO4]&#8722;. [T3SO4]+ salts could be isolated starting from T2SO4 in the reaction with [T&#8722;H&#8722;T]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or T+[CHB11Br6H5]&#8722; when a weakly coordinating anion is used as counterion. All silylated compounds could be crystallized and structurally characterized.

         <title>Separation&#8208;Controlled Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13892-13895, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox reactions are quite difficult to control because their reaction equilibrium constants strongly depart from unity (particularly if at least one of the reactants is a potent oxidizing or reducing agent). Based on calculations, smooth control of charge transfer depending solely on the separation between oxidizer and reductant is proposed. AgF2, a powerful oxidizer, may be electron&#8208;doped to a controlled extent using this approach.







Abstract
In the era of molecular devices and nanotechnology, precise control over electron&#8208;transfer processes is strongly desired. However, redox reactions are usually characterized by reaction equilibrium constants strongly departing from unity. This leads to strong favoring of either reactants or products and does not permit subtle control of transferred charge (doping). Here we propose, based on theoretical studies for periodic systems, how charge transfer between reactants could be finely manipulated in the epitaxially grown system composed of extremely strong oxidizer, reducing agent, and an inert separator&#8212;the key factor of control.

         <title>Persistent peri&#8208;Heptacene: Synthesis and In Situ Characterization</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the hitherto unknown peri&#8208;heptacene 7&#8208;PA is demonstrated by a rational molecular design strategy in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. The open&#8208;shell 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits a persistent stability (half&#8208;life &#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions.







Abstract
n&#8208;peri&#8208;Acenes (n&#8208;PAs) have gained interest as model systems of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons for potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. However, the synthesis of n&#8208;PAs larger than peri&#8208;tetracene remains challenging because of their intrinsic open&#8208;shell character and high reactivity. Presented here is the synthesis of a hitherto unknown n&#8208;PA, that is, peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA), in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected with eight 4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4 groups. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits persistent stability (t1/2&#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions. Moreover, electron&#8208;spin resonance measurements and theoretical studies reveal that 7&#8208;PA exhibits an open&#8208;shell feature and a significant tetraradical character. This strategy could be considered a modular approach for the construction of next&#8208;generation (3&#8201;N+1)&#8208;PAs (where N&#8805;3).

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13803-13806, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical porosity within a zeolite crystal is visualized by X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy to probe nanoporosity within the inorganic zeolite phase. In complement, in situ fluorescence microscopy allows to monitor pore hierarchization in real&#8208;time via organic fluorescent stains, which fill the meso&#8208; and macropore space.







Abstract
Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (in situ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by in situ fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core via a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.

         <title>Local Deuteration Enables NMR Observation of Methyl Groups in Proteins from Eukaryotic and Cell&#8208;Free Expression Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13783-13787, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;based magnetization usage can strongly benefit investigations of large protein systems via NMR spectroscopy. Here, a simple and cost&#8208;effective method to obtain locally deuterated leucine suitable for methyl NMR and to quantify its benefits is presented. The approach substantially expands the applicability of methyl labeling in emerging expression systems including cell&#8208;free and eukaryotic systems.







Abstract
Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective 13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8220;local&#8221; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.

         <title>E. coli Nickel&#8208;Iron Hydrogenase 1 Catalyses Non&#8208;native Reduction of Flavins: Demonstration for Alkene Hydrogenation by Old Yellow Enzyme Ene&#8208;reductases**

Robust [NiFe] hydrogenase 1 (Hyd1) from Escherichia coli is shown to have non&#8208;native, H2&#8208;dependent activity for FMN and FAD reduction. It is a promising recycling system for FMNH2 or FADH2 supply to flavoenzymes for chemical synthesis when coupled with an Old Yellow Enzyme ene&#8208;reductase.







Abstract
A new activity for the [NiFe] uptake hydrogenase&#8197;1 of Escherichia coli (Hyd1) is presented. Direct reduction of biological flavin cofactors FMN and FAD is achieved using H2 as a simple, completely atom&#8208;economical reductant. The robust nature of Hyd1 is exploited for flavin reduction across a broad range of temperatures (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C) and extended reaction times. The utility of this system as a simple, easy to implement FMNH2 or FADH2 regenerating system is then demonstrated by supplying reduced flavin to Old Yellow Enzyme &#8220;ene&#8208;reductases&#8221; to support asymmetric alkene reductions with up to 100&#8201;% conversion. Hyd1 turnover frequencies up to 20.4&#8197;min&#8722;1 and total turnover numbers up to 20&#8201;200 were recorded during flavin recycling.

Giant conjugated macrocycles with a diameter of roughly 7&#8197;nm consisting of up to 30 subunits were synthesized on a Ag(111) surface in a two&#8208;step reaction. Site&#8208;selective debromination initiated the synthesis, resulting in arched covalent oligomers and macrocycles, which were assisted by C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits. The subsequent cyclodehydrogenation steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles.







Abstract
We have achieved an on&#8208;surface synthesis of giant conjugated macrocycles having a diameter of &#8776;7&#8197;nm and consisting of up to 30 subunits. The synthesis started with a debrominative coupling of the molecular precursors on a hot Ag(111) surface, leading to the formation of arched oligomeric chains and macrocycles. These products were revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density functional theory to be covalent oligomers. These intermediates also display C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits due to site&#8208;selective debromination and the asymmetric molecular conformation. Subsequent cyclodehydrogenation at higher temperatures steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles. Our findings provide a novel design strategy toward &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and open up new opportunities for the precise synthesis of organic nanostructures.

Prepare for trouble&#8212;and make it double: A organoselenium&#8208;catalysed, regiospecific para&#8208;hydroxylation starting from N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids through double [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to form para&#8208;aminophenols was developed. This operationally easy reaction delivers useful para&#8208;aminophenol building blocks on small and large scales and its mechanism is supported through quantum chemical calculations as well as labeling experiments.







Abstract
A selenium&#8208;catalysed para&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acids is reported. Mechanistically, the reaction comprises an N&#8722;O bond cleavage and consecutive selenium&#8208;induced [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to deliver para&#8208;hydroxyaniline derivatives. The mechanism is studied through both 18O&#8208;crossover experiments as well as quantum chemical calculations. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation provides an unconventional synthetic approach to para&#8208;aminophenols.

An asymmetric multicomponent interrupted Kinugasa allylic alkylation (IKAA) reaction has been developed with a synergistic Cu&#8208;catalyzed Kinugasa and Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation system. This strategy provides a high yield and highly selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams, which are not easily produced by other methods. Stereoselective coupling of two transient organometallic intermediates formed in&#8197;situ is the most important feature of this reaction.

We demonstrate a general but reliable on&#8208;water synthesis and assembly strategy toward the preparation of 2D polyimide (2DPI)&#8208;graphene (G) van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) on water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (ca. 60&#8197;fs) after protonation in the heterostructure, which is among the fastest reports of vdWHs.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) are a class of atomically/molecularly thin crystalline organic 2D materials. They are intriguing candidates for the development of unprecedented organic&#8211;inorganic 2D van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) with exotic physicochemical properties. In this work, we demonstrate the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of large&#8208;area (cm2), monolayer 2D polyimide (2DPI) with 3.1&#8208;nm lattice. Such 2DPI comprises metal&#8208;free porphyrin and perylene units linked by imide bonds. We further achieve a scalable synthesis of 2DPI&#8208;graphene (2DPI&#8208;G) vdWHs via a face&#8208;to&#8208;face co&#8208;assembly of graphene and 2DPI on the water surface. Remarkably, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultra&#8208;fast interlayer charge transfer (ca. 60&#8197;fs) in the resultant 2DPI&#8208;G vdWH upon protonation by acid, which is equivalent to that of the fastest reports among inorganic 2D vdWHs. Such large interlayer electronic coupling is ascribed to the interlayer cation&#8211;&#960; interaction between 2DP and graphene.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Phosphonylation of Indoles at the C4 and C6 Positions by a Radical Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13871-13876, June 14, 2021. </description>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote phosphonylation for the indole C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;positions was achieved by a radical approach. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H activation of indole benzenoid moiety has been achieved in the past decade. However, palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C&#8722;H activation of indoles is rare. Herein, we report a challenging palladium&#8208;catalyzed remote C4&#8208;H phosphonylation of indoles by a radical approach. The method provides access to a series of C4&#8208;phosphonylated indoles, including tryptophan and tryptophan&#8208;containing dipeptides, which are typically inaccessible by direct C4&#8208;H activation due to its heavy reliance on C3 directing groups. Notably, unexpected C6&#8208;phosphonylated indoles were obtained through blocking of the C4 position. The preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reactions may proceed via a C7&#8208;palladacycle/remote&#8208;activation process. Based on the strategy, examples of remote C4&#8208;H difluoromethylation with BrCF2COOEt are also presented, suggesting that the strategy may offer a general blueprint for other cross&#8208;couplings.

A combined experimental and computational study of the (

Abstract
Multiply bonded lanthanide oxo groups are rare in coordination compounds and have not previously been reported for a surface termination of a lanthanide oxide. Here we report the observation of a Ce=O terminated ceria surface in a CeO2(111)&#8208;(
&#215;
)R30&#176; reconstruction of &#8776;3&#8197;nm thick ceria islands prepared on Pt(111). This is evidenced by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and high&#8208;resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A Ce=O stretching frequency of 775&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is observed in HREELS, compared with 766&#8197;cm&#8722;1 calculated by DFT. The calculations also predict that the Ce=O bond is weak, with an oxygen vacancy formation energy of 0.85&#8197;eV. This could play an important role in the facile removal of lattice oxygen from CeO2, accompanied by the reduction of CeIV to CeIII, which is a key attribute of ceria&#8208;based systems in connection with their unique catalytic properties.

         <title>Ultrastable and Efficient Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 Reduction Triggered by Regenerative Oxygen&#8208;Vacancies in Bi2O2CO3 Nanosheets</title>

Regenerative surface vacancies could be repeatedly created by external conditions like UV light irradiation. These regenerative surface vacancies can significantly improve the cycling stability and eventually realize both high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Herein, we first design a fast low&#8208;pressure ultraviolet light irradiation strategy for easily regenerating the nearly equivalent surface vacancies. Taking the defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets as an example, nearly equal amount of oxygen vacancies can be regenerated under UV light irradiation. Synchrotron&#8208;radiation quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra disclose the Bi sites in the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets can act as the highly active sites, which not only help to activate CO2 molecules, but also contribute to stabilizing the rate&#8208;limiting COOH* intermediate. Also, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and in situ mass spectrometry unravel the UV light irradiation contributes to accelerating CO desorption process. As a result, the O&#8208;defective Bi2O2CO3 nanosheets achieve a stability up to 2640&#8197;h over 110 cycling tests and a high evolution rate of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO.

         <title>Reversing the Chirality of Surface Ligands Can Improve the Biosafety and Pharmacokinetics of Cationic Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13829-13834, June 14, 2021. </description>

Improved biosafety and in vivo transportation of cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) are achieved by tuning the chirality of surface ligands. D&#8208;GNCs effectively shield the high toxicity induced by cationic ligands. Post&#8208;exposure to mice, renal&#8208;/hepatic&#8208;clearable D&#8208;GNCs also show superior in vivo performances in aspects of biological circulation and tumor accumulation.







Abstract
Severe toxicity and rapid in vivo clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and in vivo performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L&#8208;glutathione (L&#8208;GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D&#8208;counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L&#8208;GNCs, D&#8208;GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D&#8208;GNCs show less cell internalization than L&#8208;GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis. In vivo, the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D&#8208;/L&#8208;GNCs. D&#8208;GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly&#8208;sized and poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.

Abstract
We describe the two&#8208;electron reduction of N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;diazapyrenium dications (MDAP2+), which afforded the corresponding reduced form (MDAP0) as a highly electron&#8208;rich 16&#960; antiaromatic system. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of MDAP0 revealed a distorted quinoidal structure with high bond&#8208;length alternation. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum of MDAP0 exhibited a diagnostic proton signal (4.6&#8197;ppm) that is distinctly upfield shifted compared to that of aromatic diazapyrene (8.3&#8197;ppm). Theoretical calculations supported the existence of a paratropic ring current. These results indicate that MDAP0 exhibits antiaromatic character derived from its peripheral 16&#960;&#8208;electron conjugation.

         <title>A Colorimetric Method for Quantifying Cis and Trans Alkenes Using an Indicator Displacement Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13819-13823, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput method was developed using a colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) to quantify the alkene stereochemistry present within mixtures to an accuracy of 2&#8211;3&#8201;%. Within a series of 96&#8208;well plates, alkenes were dihydroxylated and the resulting diols were subjected to an IDA with an indicator and a boronic acid to determine the amount of threo and/or erythro vicinal diols present.







Abstract
A colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation was developed to determine the percentage of cis and trans alkenes. Using 96&#8208;well plates two steps are performed: a reaction plate for dihydroxylation of the alkenes followed by an IDA screening plate consisting of an indicator and a boronic acid. The dihydroxylation generates either erythro or threo vicinal diols from cis or trans alkenes, depending upon their syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;addition mechanisms. Threo diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of cis and trans alkenes. Blind mixtures of cis and trans alkenes were made, resulting in an average error of &#177;2&#8201;% in the percentage of cis or trans alkenes, and implementing E2 and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177;3&#8201;%. Furthermore, we developed variants of the IDA for which the color may be tuned to optimize the response for the human eye.

     alt="A Colorimetric Method for Quantifying Cis and Trans Alkenes Using an Indicator Displacement Assay"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-throughput method was developed using a colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) to quantify the alkene stereochemistry present within mixtures to an accuracy of 2&#8211;3&#8201;%. Within a series of 96-well plates, alkenes were dihydroxylated and the resulting diols were subjected to an IDA with an indicator and a boronic acid to determine the amount of &lt;i&gt;threo&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;erythro&lt;/i&gt; vicinal diols present.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) amenable to high-throughput experimentation was developed to determine the percentage of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; alkenes. Using 96-well plates two steps are performed: a reaction plate for dihydroxylation of the alkenes followed by an IDA screening plate consisting of an indicator and a boronic acid. The dihydroxylation generates either &lt;i&gt;erythro&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;threo&lt;/i&gt; vicinal diols from &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; alkenes, depending upon their &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-addition mechanisms. &lt;i&gt;Threo&lt;/i&gt; diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; alkenes. Blind mixtures of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; alkenes were made, resulting in an average error of &#177;2&#8201;% in the percentage of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; alkenes, and implementing E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177;3&#8201;%.

A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. A wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chirality are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivity via intramolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;H silylation.







Abstract
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. In the presence of a RhI catalyst with a chiral diphosphine ligand, a wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chiralities are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivities via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation. Absolute configuration analysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures revealed a novel silicon central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality relay phenomenon, which we believe will inspire further research in the field of asymmetric catalysis and chiroptical materials.

The first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation using a rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions is described in this paper. The dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex worked as an effective catalyst for the formation of ammonia and silylamine, where up to 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia and 11.7&#8197;equiv of silylamine were produced based on the Re atom of the catalyst.







Abstract
A series of rhenium complexes bearing a pyridine&#8208;based PNP&#8208;type pincer ligand are synthesized from rhenium phosphine complexes as precursors. A dinitrogen&#8208;bridged dirhenium complex bearing the PNP&#8208;type pincer ligands catalytically converts dinitrogen into ammonia during the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and [HPCy3]BArF4 (Cy=cyclohexyl, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) as a proton source at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C to afford 8.4&#8197;equiv of ammonia based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. The rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complex also catalyzes silylation of dinitrogen in the reaction with KC8 as a reductant and Me3SiCl as a silylating reagent under ambient reaction conditions to afford 11.7&#8197;equiv of tris(trimethylsilyl)amine based on the rhenium atom of the catalyst. These results demonstrate the first successful example of catalytic nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions using rhenium&#8208;dinitrogen complexes as catalysts.

         <title>Highly Coordinated Heteronuclear Calcium&#8211;Iron Carbonyl Cation Complexes [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) with d&#8722;d Bonding</title>

The [CaFe(CO)10]+ cation is characterized to be a coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 moiety through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. The complex is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8722;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond that is enhanced by the attraction between Ca and the bridging CO ligands.







Abstract
Heteronuclear calcium&#8211;iron carbonyl cation complexes in the form of [CaFe(CO)n]+ (n=5&#8211;12) are produced in the gas phase. Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations confirm that the n=10 complex is the coordination saturated ion where a Fe(CO)4 fragment is bonded with a Ca(CO)6 fragment through two side&#8208;on bridging carbonyl ligands. Bonding analysis indicates that it is best described by the bonding interactions between a [Ca(CO)6]2+ dication and an [Fe(CO)4]&#8722; anion forming a Fe&#8594;Ca d&#8722;d dative bond in the [(CO)6Ca&#8211;Fe(CO)4]+ structure, which enriches the pool of experimentally observed complexes of calcium that mimic transition metal compounds. The molecule is the first example of a heteronuclear carbonyl complex featuring a d&#8722;d bond between calcium and a transition metal.

Metal&#8208;free dearomatization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful method to yield partially saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. Yet, the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we present a very mild and selective reduction of N&#8208;heteroarenes by amine borane to synthesize a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines.







Abstract
Dearomatization is an effective method to transform readily available N&#8208;heterocycles into partially saturated motifs. Manipulation of dihydro&#8208;derivatives holds great potential and provides access to a variety of semi&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic building blocks. However, current strategies are limited in scope and the use of sensitive reagents restricts the applicability in synthetic laboratories. Herein, we report the synthesis of a broad variety of N&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines by very mild and selective reduction with amine borane for the first time.

         <title>A Double Deprotonation Strategy for Cascade Annulations of Palladium&#8211;Trimethylenemethanes and Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Carbonates to Construct Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane Frameworks</title>

The palladium&#8211;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles can be chemoseletively generated from 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl)allyl carbonates via a deprotonation strategy, which allows the SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition to Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates from activated ketones. Cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations are followed to construct enantioenriched bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks with three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers.







Abstract
Here we report that the chemoselective activation of Tsuji's 2&#8208;(cyanomethyl)allyl carbonates to generate the palladium&#8211;trimethylenemethane 1,3&#8208;dipoles via a deprotonation strategy can be realized in the presence of Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman carbonates from substantial activated ketones. The following SN2&#8242;&#8208;addition enables the formation of new 1,3&#8208;dipole species having an activated alkene moiety through a second deprotonation process, which then undergo cascade [1+2]/[3+2] annulations to furnish complex bicyclic [3.1.0]hexane frameworks having three contiguous quaternary stereogenic centers with good to excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, by using benzoyl aldehyde&#8208;derived substrates, a [1+4]/[3+2] annulation sequence is similarly developed to produce fused cyclopenta[b]furan architectures.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Caveolin&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13900-13905, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The protein caveolin&#8208;1 was divided into five peptide segments for solid&#8208;phase synthesis. To improve the solubility of the triply palmitoylated C&#8208;terminal region, O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After ligation, introduction of the palmitoyl groups, and removal of the protecting groups, the isopeptide structures were converted into the native peptide bonds (see scheme). The obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into bicelles.







Abstract
Caveolin&#8208;1, which is an essential protein for caveola formation, was chemically synthesized. It is composed of 177 amino acid residues, is triply palmitoylated at the C&#8208;terminal region, and is inserted into the lipid bilayer to form a V&#8208;shaped structure in the middle of the polypeptide chain. The entire sequence was divided into five peptide segments, each of which was synthesized by the solid&#8208;phase method. To improve the solubility of the C&#8208;terminal region, O&#8208;acyl isopeptide structures were incorporated. After ligation by the thioester method and the introduction of the palmitoyl groups, all the protecting groups were removed and the isopeptide structures were converted into the native peptide bond. Finally, the obtained polypeptide was successfully inserted into bicelles, thus showing the success of the synthesis.

         <title>ZW800&#8208;PEG: A Renal Clearable Zwitterionic Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophore for Potential Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13847-13852, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZW800&#8208;PEG is a water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;sticky, and renal clearable near&#8208;infrared fluorophore owing to the balanced zwitterionic charges. By introducing a stable sulfide linker, it improves serum stability and also exhibits potential for augmenting photothermal therapy. It shows a maximum emission wavelength at 800&#8197;nm, enabling its use for image&#8208;guided interventions in the OR using conventional near&#8208;infrared imaging systems.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. Despite tremendous advances in imaging devices, surprisingly only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previous fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker. ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800&#8197;nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and augmenting photothermal therapy.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Cancer Meroterpenoids Dysideanone&#8197;B and Dysiherbol&#8197;A and Structural Reassignment of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>

The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer natural products dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been completed and the structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised. A radical cyclization was employed to construct the 6/6/6/6 skeleton of dysideanone&#8197;B and a Heck reaction was utilized to forge the 6/6/5/6 core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer meroterpenoids dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been accomplished in a divergent way. The synthetic route features: 1)&#8197;a site and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;position alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone derivative with a bulky benzyl bromide to join the terpene and aromatic moieties together and set the stage for subsequent cyclization reactions; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular radical cyclization to construct the 6/6/6/6&#8208;tetracycle of dysideanone&#8197;B and an intramolecular Heck reaction to forge the 6/6/5/6&#8208;fused core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A. A late&#8208;stage introduction of the ethoxy group in dysideanone&#8197;B reveals that this group might come from the solvent ethanol. The structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised based on our chemical total synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzothiophene/Benzofuran&#8208;Fused Biaryls by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Arene Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 25, Page 13918-13922, June 14, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed enantioselective de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzylbenzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes has been developed. This cascade process comprises a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion, allowing rapid access to atropoisomeric tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are prevalent in natural products, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. However, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed de novo construction of an aromatic ring with concomitant axial chirality induction for the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers is far less developed, and the efficient synthesis of axially chiral tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls remains an unsolved problem under NHC catalysis. Reported here is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes through a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. The developed method provides efficient and general access to novel axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls in high enantioselectivities and works well for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls.

&lt;p&gt;The N-heterocyclic carbene catalyzed enantioselective de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran-fused biaryls from enals and 2-benzylbenzothiophene/benzofuran-3-carbaldehydes has been developed. This cascade process comprises a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central-to-axial chirality conversion, allowing rapid access to atropoisomeric tri- and tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted biaryls with high enantioselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;
